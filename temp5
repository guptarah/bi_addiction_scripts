for a lot of people it &apos;s like you know actually yeah i don &apos;t really see any problems with what is going on or i &apos;m pretty happy with how things are and i &apos;m just gonna kind of stick to how it &apos;s going and not really change my use 	 for_a a_lot lot_of of_people people_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_you you_know know_actually actually_yeah yeah_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_see see_any any_problems problems_with with_what what_is is_going going_on on_or or_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_pretty pretty_happy happy_with with_how how_things things_are are_and and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_just just_gonna gonna_kind kind_of of_stick stick_to to_how how_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_and and_not not_really really_change change_my my_use use_.

okay so by cutting down it sounds like you were thinking use occasionally but not use as much 	 okay_so so_by by_cutting cutting_down down_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_were were_thinking thinking_use use_occasionally occasionally_but but_not not_use use_as as_much much_.

okay and it seems like what you had said too is maybe if there were other ways that you could help deal with your anxiety then smoking weed wouldn &apos;t necessarily be something that would be as necessary all the time 	 okay_and and_it it_seems seems_like like_what what_you you_had had_said said_too too_is is_maybe maybe_if if_there there_were were_other other_ways ways_that that_you you_could could_help help_deal deal_with with_your your_anxiety anxiety_then then_smoking smoking_weed weed_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_necessarily necessarily_be be_something something_that that_would would_be be_as as_necessary necessary_all all_the the_time time_.
and so if you had to rate it on a one to ten scale with one being not at all and ten being extremely how confident would you be at this point to be able to start working towards that goal 	 and_so so_if if_you you_had had_to to_rate rate_it it_on on_a a_one one_to to_ten ten_scale scale_with with_one one_being being_not not_at at_all all_and and_ten ten_being being_extremely extremely_how how_confident confident_would would_you you_be be_at at_this this_point point_to to_be be_able able_to to_start start_working working_towards towards_that that_goal goal_.
