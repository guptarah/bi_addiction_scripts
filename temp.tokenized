and so audrey do you have any questions for me before we get started at all or .
yes .
yes .
yes and .
i think you had said your husband is in this study as well .
right .
oh okay .
okay for an interview .
and so .
what were some of .
since you learned about it through your husband .
was there anything that you thought about the study at all or .
oops .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
oh nice .
sounds nice .
.
mm .
oh so that makes it really difficult .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
oh so and yeah being able to get a hot meal at q f c .
yeah .
yeah it &apos;s a good day for it too .
so i know naomi had asked you some questions about drug use .
and you had talked to her and you had said that in the past thirty days you had mentioned using heroin cocaine .
heroin and cocaine .
okay so could you tell me a little bit more about it .
okay .
mm .
okay .
mm .
mm-hmm .
oh .
yeah .
that &apos;s frustrating .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
hmm .
mm .
you mean when you &apos;re sick .
yeah .
hmm .
hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm .
so when you &apos;re dope sick it also affects your heart condition and all that .
okay .
oh i didn &apos;t know that .
oh i didn &apos;t know that that was one of the things that they kind of look for .
huh .
and i &apos;ve came in and i told my counselor it was over the weekend i woke up to my whole left side was paralyzed and my i just thought my arm went to sleep .
mm-hmm .
it sounds scary .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
yeah that &apos;s got to be freaky to be awake for the whole time .
mm-hmm .
mm .
to get your liver out of your chest .
mm .
so it &apos;s a little more than just numb it &apos;s .
yeah .
you said that you and your husband have been using for about twenty five years .
what are some of the things that you like about it .
the dope .
we can save the husband for another conversation .
mm .
mm .
so you &apos;re at a point .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
it sounds like it &apos;s hard to trust people yeah .
in that environment .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm .
it seems like that might be one of the drawbacks though right of .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
it seems tricky right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so it sort of shift .
it shifted for you now from something that might have been more like fun partying thing to now the way you described it as kind of how you guys start your day and have each day and there &apos;s a routine involved .
mm-hmm .
does it get expensive or .
i actually don &apos;t i &apos;m afraid .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
so you &apos;ve taken methadone before .
okay .
so just kind of wean yourself off .
i think it depends for different people so i think for some people methadone might be the most effective for them for some people they might be able to wean themselves off on their own .
i don &apos;t know what the statistics are on which tends to help more people .
but i think everyone &apos;s a little different and .
so just like everyone is i think at a different point too with their lives where some people are kinda happy and fine with the point that they &apos;re at with the amount that they &apos;re using .
some people want to cut down some people want to some people want to use in a way that &apos;s safer there &apos;s a bunch of other varieties so .
hmm .
mm .
mm .
and what were you using before that .
mm and as you were describing it it was sort of like it sounds like you might have been kind of tricked into that situation a little bit by the person who was there .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm .
mm .
so how do you feel about some of the health problems that are going on for you right now .
that &apos;s .
what were some of the questions you were asking them .
wow .
mm .
mm .
so the overdosing isn &apos;t as scary but it sounds like what you had described of that having that sensation you had recently of feeling weird kinda scary numb yeah that sounds like it was pretty terrifying .
huh seems like there &apos;s been some close calls some scary things .
mm-hmm .
wow .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm scary .
so i &apos;m wondering what was going on in your head at the time when that was happening .
what were you thinking or feeling .
mm .
oh .
to wear off you mean .
yeah .
that is .
incredibly long time .
mm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
oh wow .
so it seems like that you &apos;ve seen some scary things gone through some scary things and had to deal with people that are maybe not the most trustworthy .
but .
mm-hmm .
oh no .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
to look for oh .
oh .
wow .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
that &apos;s gotta be a horrible thing to watch yeah .
yeah .
when getting dope becomes more important than helping save someone &apos;s life yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
oh .
mm-hmm .
mm .
yeah .
but still yeah to watch someone do something like that .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
and i know that you had mentioned a little bit earlier that you had looked into methadone .
is that something that you &apos;re that you &apos;re looking into .
you said yeah .
because of the heart .
condition .
but at some point it was .
something that you were interested in or .
mm-hmm .
mm .
the .
private doctors you &apos;re saying .
okay .
and then you said .
oh .
and you .
and then you said with the actual clinics set up to help people who are trying to get off heroin that they don &apos;t include you if you have heart problems .
okay .
that &apos;s a tricky situation then .
mm-hmm .
oh .
you said .
it felt like there were bugs crawling in your veins wow .
mm .
yeah it sounds really awful .
.
mm .
hmm .
so they don &apos;t have to go through yeah yeah .
so where do you see you and your husband in five years &apos; time .
mm-hmm .
.
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so you &apos;re seeing it as you and your husband five years from now still gonna be kinda keeping it the same .
and what are your .
mm .
yeah it sounds like that there &apos;s been much more health complications that have been coming up for you lately .
wow .
mm-hmm .
on the brain yeah .
yeah sure totally .
well .
well yeah and it &apos;s been definitely twenty minutes .
so would it be okay with you if i give you a call in a week &apos;s time just to say hello .
okay .
doing right and wrong i guess .
that &apos;s right .
so how are you today .
yeah .
and do you know much about the study or what we &apos;re doing or .
no okay and so .
not too much .
and so just to kinda the basics of it we &apos;re trying to see if doing a brief talk with someone like this makes any impact on their drug use and then in turn impact on their health or other areas of their life .
but you probably went through that .
initial interview was about an hour an hour and a half .
they asked you a lot of yes or no kinda questions about your health legal issues relationships drug use and stuff like that .
and so what we wanna do here is kinda shift gears and give you more of an opportunity just to speak about how drug use fits into your life and kinda just go from there .
this is more about you telling me making me understand how this plays a part in your life .
and as a topic of change comes up it &apos;s this isn &apos;t an instance where i &apos;m trying to sell you on anything or shove any philosophies down your throat or anything like that and we &apos;ll just keep it real open .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm .
mm .
so you &apos;ve had .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
what &apos;s wrong with the shoulder and the wrists .
arthritis .
pretty painful .
yeah .
okay .
mm .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
so you weren &apos;t eating very much .
mm-hmm .
so marijuana really serves a lot of different functions for you .
it was .
it was helping you sleep it &apos;s been helping you through some recent pain and also helping you settle your stomach .
and so even though you &apos;ve got these allergy medicines that are kinda helping you sleep a little bit better it also it still helps with the pain and digestion or help settle your stomach .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
mm-hmm oh okay so some of that is some of that &apos;s from nervousness .
what &apos;s that .
oh okay what your brain .
or your mind .
mm-hmm .
oh okay .
yeah .
yeah you couldn &apos;t .
do anything .
oh man .
that didn &apos;t fit you very well .
mm-hmm .
so it keeps you active but helps you slow down at the same time .
and so in so you &apos;re using marijuana for sleep pain anxiety .
how does your day look with using marijuana .
how does it fit into your day .
when you &apos;re using it .
and how much that kind of stuff .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
i see so it really helps so if you &apos;re not using it you &apos;re thinking the pain is more prevalent or you &apos;re focused more on the pain .
and then i &apos;m assuming that interferes with other things or makes the pain hurt more or .
it drags the day out okay .
okay and so this helps you so that you can focus on other things .
mm-hmm .
as a cook .
as a baker .
okay .
interacting mingling and stuff like that .
okay and if you didn &apos;t have marijuana you &apos;d be too edgy to .
yeah you &apos;d be a little more irritable you &apos;d be like withdrawn or something .
.
and you &apos;re probably the kinda guy that if you &apos;re feeling that way because you &apos;re a social guy that you kinda turn away from people .
they notice yeah .
yeah i see .
and almost it sounds like in a sense you wouldn &apos;t wanna you &apos;d feel like you were burdening them if you were telling them about all your pain and stuff so .
okay .
oh okay so you can &apos;t really talk about it .
you don &apos;t have an outlet for talking about your tendency .
.
yeah .
so smoking in a way helps you maintain that having to keep it all to yourself .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
you feel like you would drink more if you weren &apos;t smoking .
okay .
were you trying to kinda .
like you said before i think you said something like numb yourself out or especially at night but during the day when you &apos;re working just to keep the edge off so you can interact with people .
right .
but the .
the okay so no drinking at work .
but that &apos;s what the marijuana &apos;s for .
and if you weren &apos;t using marijuana you &apos;d be using alcohol to achieve the same effects at least at night .
yeah okay .
mm-hmm .
oh .
don &apos;t want it to be a finger .
yeah .
so the difference between using alcohol at work and marijuana at work there &apos;s .
yeah .
you wouldn &apos;t cut your finger off with marijuana .
.
mm-hmm .
okay so let me see if i got everything that we &apos;ve been talking about .
and that &apos;s you experience a lot of pain experience some problems with your stomach both because of anxiety and because of medication you &apos;re taking and also being at work being edgy at work and stuff like that .
high stress .
right and so smoking marijuana in a sense helps you with all that stuff it helps you sleep it helps your stomach helps you it takes off the edge at work also so that you don &apos;t have to .
it helps you focus that &apos;s right you said that .
it helps you focus .
mm-hmm .
and so there wouldn &apos;t be a way to do that with the pain that you have or .
mm-hmm so it really helps you be able to do things that you wouldn &apos;t be able to do otherwise mm-hmm .
yeah so i mean it sounds like it really adds to your life in a way that it makes things a lot more manageable .
so i mean it sounds like there &apos;s just quite a bit of positives there .
and i noticed on your sheet here it said that you &apos;re just you &apos;re looking more at controlled use right .
what do you mean by that .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
baking it into kinda .
mm-hmm .
oh for the medical marijuana .
oh okay wow so you might start jumping into that so it sounds like that seems maybe a little bit better or different than .
mm-hmm .
yeah so if i &apos;m hearing you right then there &apos;s something about not using it so recreationally and also trying to watch out for your health and stuff like that too .
is that right .
and what is it about .
what &apos;s .
there must be a difference between using it .
i can &apos;t talk today .
recreationally versus using it the way you &apos;re using it .
.
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
oh .
oh man .
.
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
huh so you used to get in trouble .
mm-hmm .
i &apos;m from michigan .
my brother &apos;s actually a cop in michigan but it &apos;s all right .
i &apos;ve heard it all .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
.
oh that &apos;s cool that we &apos;re both michiganders .
but you were saying that you were .
well and i kinda took us off track there but .
i was excited you were from michigan .
but so yeah what about .
so there was something different between then and now where you were getting in trouble where you weren &apos;t able to keep it at one place .
mm-hmm there &apos;s almost something maybe kind of rebellious about it before but you it almost seems like you look somehow that wouldn &apos;t fit into your life now that .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm and you also said before you didn &apos;t have a place for it or .
you can keep it at your house now you were moving it around a lot before .
okay so you &apos;ve there &apos;s something about being more stable too that and it sounds like in this relationship where you &apos;re feeling like i &apos;m kinda being the you &apos;re being very aware of what you &apos;re doing and how you &apos;re using .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
hmm .
and it seems like that you are interested in maintaining that and that .
that &apos;s .
yeah .
well that &apos;s cool .
i mean it sound i can kinda just hear how even with the use of marijuana that because of the way that your life has changed now you value now that you &apos;ve changed your way of using it and kinda viewing it .
and you were saying before that you &apos;d wake up with a burned out pipes and stuff gone .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
so you &apos;re losing interest in alcohol .
and does that relate to the marijuana .
or does that relate more what you &apos;re talking about what your goals are and your values and stuff .
oh okay .
uh-huh .
yeah yeah .
mm-hmm .
that is cool .
it sounds like a really good situation .
it sounds like you &apos;re really happy with that .
for the first time in how long .
.
so this a whole new experience .
well congratulations .
.
yeah .
.
a lot of diversity out here .
yeah yeah .
mm-hmm .
so it &apos;s like a load off really .
yeah .
mm-hmm well that &apos;s excellent .
yeah i mean it sounds like coming out here .
.
all right .
this it sounds like it &apos;s made a huge impact on you and it sounds like there &apos;s big differences and there &apos;s been a lot of things affecting how you view for one drinking and then two the way you use marijuana you &apos;ve used it for a long time but you &apos;re using it really kinda more of a mindful manner using it for there &apos;s a purpose to it .
has there ever been a time where it &apos;s been an interference .
in i mean it sounds like you &apos;ve got a pretty good routine with it .
has it ever interfered .
mm-hmm .
yeah so so it doesn &apos;t really interfere with activities but it does cost a lot of money .
you find yourself spending more .
mm-hmm .
mm .
it &apos;s better .
okay .
so it &apos;s just so you know it &apos;s gonna be safer and it &apos;s safer and it &apos;s cheaper .
right .
oh i see .
keep you buying .
and the distributors you &apos;ve looked into it they don &apos;t do that .
okay .
oh good .
mm-hmm .
yeah so you have been very mindful about that .
mm-hmm i wonder how the cost has affected your use in purchasing and .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
right so it &apos;s really about if you could fit it in or not how it fits into the budget it &apos;s not like you &apos;re saying like oh i need marijuana i &apos;m gonna go out and buy a bunch .
you &apos;re .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay yeah .
so you &apos;re not it &apos;s not coming straight out of your budget you &apos;re doing a little something extra to get the extra money to get it .
yeah well there you go that makes sense .
okay well the last thing that i would kinda run through is just kinda what we call a menu of options .
just so i &apos;m not not making assumptions about what your decisions are at this time .
and let me see if i can remember these .
well so the different options that you would have would be not really changing anything .
using in a conscious mindful kinda manner .
quitting completely .
seeking support .
and let me see if i can think of the other one .
i can &apos;t .
but you kinda get the jist .
mm-hmm so make sure you &apos;re using it in a controlled manner .
and it seems like you &apos;ve been really mindful about it .
are there any is there anything else that you would do to make sure that you continue to do that .
or is there still other changes that you would make where it would be like oh this is even more mindful .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right so it sounds like waiting for how that medication &apos;s going to affect you and so based on that you don &apos;t know if you might use a little more or need to use a little less of something less so you have to stay kinda open to that .
but it sounds like overall you &apos;ve been pretty mindful and you wanna make sure that you stay mindful about how you &apos;re using it and using it in a controlled manner .
excellent .
well okay and how was this for you .
maybe different than you anticipated .
didn &apos;t know what to expect .
.
it &apos;s just me it &apos;s just me .
well we definitely appreciate your participation .
and as promised here &apos;s your gift card .
we also .
.
well there &apos;s not really anything .
better late than never right .
well it was excellent meeting you .
great well enjoy the little bit of nice day that &apos;s left and .
oh that sounds like fun .
alright i &apos;ll just put this right here .
so appreciate you coming back again for this .
and just wondering how much you know about this next step here in the .
.
you and i our conversation .
what did naomi tell you about what we &apos;re gonna talk about or .
okay .
so what this is is just meant to be kind of a conversation between you and i about your drug use .
and i &apos;d kinda like to know how you feel about it .
what &apos;s working for you what &apos;s not working for you about it .
just sort of generally if you wouldn &apos;t mind starting off by telling me a little bit about that .
mm-hmm .
so what don &apos;t you like about it .
okay are there things that you do like about it .
so you like the high but it increases your heart rate and it costs too much .
and it sounds also like it makes you just you feel guilty .
it makes you feel badly because you feel guilty .
can you tell me a little bit more about that .
so when you alcohol it sounds like maybe impacts or affects your thinking so that you &apos;re maybe not as clear about the consequences or the things that you don &apos;t like about it when you &apos;re drinking .
alright .
so you got a lot of reasons excuse me to not use crack because well it sounds like you don &apos;t like the way it makes you feel physically spending too much money it &apos;s illegal it &apos;s bad for you you it causes health problems so you had all those things that you don &apos;t like about it .
but on the other hand when you &apos;re drinking maybe you &apos;re not thinking those things .
well what do you think you might do about that .
yeah .
oh so if you weren &apos;t drinking but yet you had it was all around you you had those same people offering it to you you &apos;re able to say .
yeah why do you think that is .
yeah why do you think though it is you would react differently when you &apos;re drinking as opposed to when you &apos;re not drinking .
so you &apos;re more agreeable to doing anything suggestible when you &apos;re drinking .
yeah .
but when you &apos;re not drinking you think more clearly you think about your health and you &apos;re being more responsible but when you &apos;re drinking those things seem to disappear .
yeah .
why do you think that is .
why do you think the alcohol has that effect .
mm-hmm .
what do you .
how do you feel .
about that .
yeah .
so you &apos;ve got a lot of guilt .
yeah and guilt makes you feel bad and about yourself .
yeah that &apos;s kind of a hard thing to have to live with every day .
what do you do to manage .
mm-hmm .
yeah so what do you do to stay away from drinking .
so you have things that you enjoy doing exercise is one .
reading .
yeah .
and when you &apos;re doing stuff like that you &apos;re not drinking .
and then you &apos;re not tempted by these people who are around to use crack .
yeah .
but it &apos;s .
still hard .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
right and that &apos;s challenging too when you see it when it &apos;s there in your environment and it &apos;s in your mind and it &apos;s always present and it &apos;s a temptation .
wow .
where do you live .
not far from here .
yeah that &apos;s challenging because that type of thing is around here .
mm-hmm .
but you &apos;re trying to do the right thing .
mm-hmm .
yeah what do you do to do that .
you mentioned some things already .
mm-hmm are there other things that you do or that you &apos;ve found to be helpful .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
how does your family fit in there .
mm-hmm .
you just feel kind of a responsibility to your family even though they &apos;re far away an example to not be high .
mm-hmm .
so just from the little that we &apos;ve talked here it sounds like it &apos;s very important for you to not drink and to not do drugs .
alright the other question would be how confident do you think you are that you can stop using crack and stop drinking .
so you &apos;re really confident .
how about on a .
scale of one to ten if one was not at all confident and ten was the most confident where would you fall in that .
okay so that &apos;s pretty high .
but .
but it changes .
where .
where would you have an option for treatment .
okay .
do you know how to get in there .
yeah my a a counselor that &apos;s here .
okay she could help you .
and you meet with her pretty frequently .
okay .
okay .
so things would have to get worse you &apos;re saying for you to go into treatment .
you don &apos;t want them .
to get worse though .
yeah .
would things have to get worse for you to go to treatment .
why is that .
because they wouldn &apos;t let you in or .
alright so let &apos;s go back just briefly .
again because it sounds like again this is very important to you you &apos;ve got a lot of good reasons to not use drugs to stop drinking including your family your health money just how it makes you feel about yourself and you &apos;re pretty confident right now but you know that that can change .
what would it take for your confidence level to be a ten .
what would things look like for you .
how would you know that i &apos;m even more sure that i can do this or that i &apos;ve done it .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
i wonder how much of a change in your environment would help like if you were able to find a new area of town to live in or .
yeah .
but from what i understand and i talked to some counselors before they say it only lasts for about ten or fifteen minutes .
the craving .
so it &apos;s getting through that craving .
yeah what do you do to do that .
mm-hmm .
yeah so you know the craving is gonna come and so you have to be prepared when it comes and acknowledge this is what &apos;s happening i &apos;m having this craving .
and that can help being aware of what &apos;s happening to you and why and then what you can do about it .
and it sounds like you &apos;re quite a long way there but that it &apos;s still a challenge .
but you &apos;ve got good support and some options .
what do you think you &apos;re gonna do now about all this .
what &apos;s your plan .
right .
yeah .
yeah .
well you &apos;ve got a lot of motivation there to change something .
yeah and i wish you the best of luck doing it .
i think you can do it .
you seem pretty motivated and you &apos;ve got good resources and options and a lot of good reasons .
the next step between our interaction here would be me calling you again in one week just on the phone just to kind of re-hash what we &apos;ve just talked about .
is that alright with you .
five minutes .
it &apos;s alright .
what &apos;s your .
okay .
mm-hmm .
well if i can &apos;t get ahold of you i may try to just catch you here if you &apos;re here some .
okay so maybe i &apos;ll call you but then if i don &apos;t get ahold of you i &apos;ll try to catch you on thursday .
i can look it up .
that &apos;s gonna be the ninth no the seventh .
okay so this is a list that i can offer you of treatment resources .
i know you already have some options .
but this is kind of a handy list with like a phone number for the twenty four hour helpline and some other community resources .
i can give you this if you want it .
okay and what was your name one more time .
i &apos;m sorry .
peters p e t e r s .
okay alright .
we &apos;re done .
in about a week i &apos;ll call you in a week .
but naomi is gonna call you or get ahold of you in about three months .
yeah .
alright .
thank you .
here we go so thanks for coming back .
i know that &apos;s kind of a hassle sometimes .
okay .
oh .
oh .
you just going to bail huh .
good good well i appreciate you signing up in this study .
and i know you had to answer a lot of questions yesterday .
but we &apos;re just going to have a conversation about your use and just kind of explore that for you .
i &apos;m not going to tell you what you need to do or beat you over the head with anything .
so it &apos;s really kind of just to help you look at the issue and see what &apos;s going on for you .
one of the questionnaires that you filled out chris was called the drug abuse screening test .
and it kind of rates people &apos;s risk for their use on a scale from zero to one to ten .
and is was just wondering if you &apos;d kind of be interested in knowing where you placed on that .
mm-hmm .
okay so where do you think .
i &apos;ll tell you what you got .
but where do you think .
you were rated at zero being no risk and ten being .
eight .
well you came out a seven so that &apos;s pretty close .
uh-huh .
so they kind of do this pyramid diagram to kind of explain or to show .
and yeah you were up here kind of in the severe risk category at least according to that test .
what &apos;s that mean to you .
is that how you &apos;d see yourself too .
mm okay .
that &apos;s your downfall really .
wow .
mm-hmm .
.
mm-hmm .
oh okay how else do you think use whether it &apos;s drugs drugs and alcohol how do you see that putting you at risk .
how does that affect your life .
mm-hmm .
oh but the alcohol just kind of caused you to not think straight and .
wow so you must have woke up pretty blitzed .
how do you feel about all your use .
end of what .
mm-hmm .
for .
right .
treatment programs .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
and you don &apos;t really remember any of that .
had you had blackouts before .
mm-hmm .
what &apos;s that mean to you .
how do you feel about that .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
what it sounds like as you &apos;re talking that life was really fucked up before .
and now it &apos;s not quite so bad .
you said you &apos;ve had blackouts before so you &apos;re kind of like that &apos;s just what happens .
they don &apos;t scare you anymore .
or are you concerned that if you continue to drink you &apos;ll black out and again take stuff that you &apos;re not even really being aware you &apos;re taking .
how .
okay so that &apos;s one concern about if you &apos;re having blackouts .
mm-hmm .
you could be robbed or hurt or maybe given stuff that you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re actually taking .
what &apos;s this like for you now you and i sitting here talking about this .
so the buzz is from the meds not from alcohol or anything .
wow .
mm-hmm why do you think you continue to drink .
let me veer away from drugs and alcohol for a minute .
you &apos;ve alluded to kind of your past is speckled with all kinds of shit going down .
and you &apos;ve got hep c and you &apos;ve been diagnosed bipolar .
and i kind of get this sense .
and tell me if i &apos;m off base .
kind of get this sense that life just kind of sucks .
what do you want different for your life .
mm .
well we &apos;d all like that one .
what do you think would give you that .
mm-hmm .
i understand that .
right .
what would help you get it together .
or what is it you need to get together .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
right .
mm-hmm .
so when you talked about going to treatment twelve times you were talking about a a .
or you were talking about in-patient treatment .
ah .
but it sounds like that doesn &apos;t do it for you anymore .
mm .
going regularly .
so chris i want to come back to this point you raised a while ago .
because i think it affects or is connected to your decisions to use whatever it is you &apos;re going to use .
you said part of you has this oh just fuck it attitude .
just do whatever i want to hell with it i don &apos;t care and then on the other hand there &apos;s a part of you that says chris don &apos;t give up this could be better it &apos;s kind of like you &apos;re caught between those two .
mm-hmm .
what do you need .
if it &apos;s kind of like a teeter totter what do you need on the side where it says don &apos;t give up .
what would help .
mm-hmm .
oh .
somebody kind of coming down and slopping you on the head .
if you were standing on that teeter totter are you in the middle .
are you on one end .
more toward one end or the other .
or just off center .
or are you .
where are you .
mm-hmm .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m seeing too i feel like you &apos;re kind of stepping toward that and yet part of you feels like oh i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen can i trust myself can i stay on this side of center .
mm-hmm .
right .
wow .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
.
yeah .
mm-hmm .
do you remember what you were thinking at the time when you went and you couldn &apos;t get work .
wow okay .
mm-hmm .
right .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
when you say you smoke weed daily i mean do you get wasted on that .
or are you smoking several times a day or .
.
so when you regularly smoke .
okay .
okay .
so .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
what about the other drugs that you take off and on the methadone the .
mm-hmm do you take those kinds of things regularly if you can get it or find it .
or was that just kind of the .
mm .
then you &apos;ll get some .
what are you looking for when you take that whatever it is .
relaxed you .
so you don &apos;t need the other stuff as much you &apos;re not looking for that okay .
.
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm .
right .
okay so what i what i &apos;m hearing in all this is i like to smoke weed i kind of do that on a daily basis the other drugs the xanax or the methadone or whatever else it is i don &apos;t do that regularly and i &apos;m not looking for it maybe if i have excess money or boredom but it &apos;s not kind of your substance .
but the alcohol is kind of the trigger that fucks everything up that if you drink it &apos;s kind all bets are off you don &apos;t always know what &apos;s going to happen or what you &apos;re going to do or and that it if you &apos;ve got hep c though it &apos;s causing you more problems you &apos;ve got blackouts that you &apos;ve lost days and time and you don &apos;t know kind of what you &apos;re doing and it makes you more vulnerable somebody could beat you up or rob you or give you something that you don &apos;t know what it is you &apos;re taking .
and i &apos;m wondering if approaching this not an all or nothing .
kind of like you said sobriety the way i define it .
if you can think about is there a way that you can modify change maybe stop i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s something you &apos;re interested in the alcohol .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
but it sounds like you weren &apos;t even thinking about it and the next thing you knew you had bought a fifth .
what is it that you think would help you and when those moments come up say no i can &apos;t do that .
mm-hmm .
do you feel like you can stop drinking without antabuse .
you say now i don &apos;t want to .
mm-hmm .
.
mm-hmm .
okay .
so let &apos;s key in on that .
because what i &apos;m trying help you figure out what will help you get to where you want to be .
you kind of talk about i don &apos;t want to drink and yet there &apos;s this spontaneity that occurs when the next thing i know i &apos;ve got a fifth in my hand .
i know sometimes things seem like they just occur and all of a sudden we &apos;re doing something and we don &apos;t know how we got there .
but i think sometimes there are some steps some thought processes that get us there .
and so i think this spontaneity thing seems to be the key for you around the alcohol .
and so if it &apos;s like well maybe i &apos;ll just go get a fifth it &apos;s being able to kind of recognize that that thought comes up and being able to say okay let me think through do i really want to do that what am i going to get from it what &apos;s it going to cost me .
and i don &apos;t mean money i mean what &apos;s it going to cost me to do that .
and is there another way i can in other words give yourself that old count to ten before you act kind of thing .
because that kind of thing you allow yourself to kind of think through things to see is that really what i want to do .
have you ever done anything like that .
mm-hmm .
oh .
mm-hmm so you &apos;re doing that already that kind of evaluation process that thinking it through .
mm-hmm .
wow okay .
mm-hmm so you &apos;re at the point that you really do need to start making some changes here .
mm-hmm .
sure .
mm-hmm .
.
not knowing what you &apos;re really going through .
gees that &apos;s kind of scary .
i kind of come back to that teeter totter that balance thing and trying to help you kind of think through what are the things that you need to help keep moving you toward that don &apos;t give up side .
and part of that sounds like giving yourself that time to evaluate and think through things before you make the decision so you &apos;re not just acting kind of on the spur of the moment .
what else would you need .
mm-hmm .
somebody .
exactly .
you said you don &apos;t .
mm .
you talked about needing maybe getting some friends and developing some kind of support .
mm-hmm .
right .
i hear that .
mm-hmm .
really .
and you keep those going or reconnect with those .
mm-hmm .
the other thing i hear is with the friends well they &apos;re almost too good for me or i &apos;m not as good as they are because i still would want to smoke weed .
it &apos;s kind of an all or nothing view of how you see things .
i think realizing nobody &apos;s perfect and those people that you think are too good for you they probably have their issues too .
and it &apos;s being able to kind of develop friendships .
and maybe you won &apos;t get everything from one person but you can get some kind of support from one person and something from somebody else .
it &apos;s almost like you &apos;ve kind of cut yourself off from even trying because well i &apos;m not quite like the .
well it might be a if you can kind of say well i may not be quite like them but i &apos;m not that different either .
yeah you know i hear you saying i need to move toward that don &apos;t give up side more and i know that one of the things is i need to stop the alcohol because that really gets things fucked up big time .
and that you &apos;ve made some strides in that .
as you said nine times out of the ten i &apos;m able to not use the .
i think looking at what else would help you keep that you know .
is it broadening your friendship network so that you don &apos;t get bored and have people to hang out and do things with and talk with .
is reconnecting with a a or something like that even though you may not get everything again out of that is that something that would help .
i don &apos;t know .
but looking at what would kind of help shore you up and assist you .
you talked about antabuse and i know you &apos;ve had a somewhat jokingly somewhat serious but is that something that you &apos;d want to talk to your doctor about .
but looking at you &apos;ve been through a hell of a lot in your life at this point and there may be lots of reasons why you &apos;ve been in the places and done the things that you &apos;ve done .
but you &apos;re at this point and i hear you saying this has to change .
otherwise i &apos;m going to next time i might not come out of it .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
wow .
right .
and so you &apos;re saying this is kind of getting scared about this .
i believe that you can keep taking those steps toward the hope end of the spectrum .
we all have that sometimes fuck it attitude like i &apos;m not worth it or i can &apos;t do it or it &apos;s not worth it or whatever it is .
but i think it &apos;s important to kind of remember that i do want to live i do want to have a life i do .
as you said i thought it was a wonderful way you said it .
i want kind of this reliable presence of happiness .
i think being able to think about well what can i do to take some steps because we do have to take the steps .
steps don &apos;t come to us what can we do to help move ourselves toward that even if we don &apos;t do it perfectly even if it doesn &apos;t always work out .
mm-hmm .
well and that &apos;s not to say you &apos;re a terrible person or beating yourself up .
it &apos;s like okay here &apos;s a pattern that i &apos;ve gotten into but i know i can change the pattern .
you &apos;ve changed the pattern already .
and you said .
which i think is a really important awareness .
that the lithium has already kind of calmed you down so a lot of the reasons you were using drugs and alcohol to relax to escape to whatever that dynamic that feeling inside you has already changed .
it &apos;s just kind of being able to curb in that alcohol use that sends you over the edge sometimes .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
wow .
.
yeah .
mm .
oh my .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
wow .
right .
right hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
sure .
wow .
on the ground .
oh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
sure .
mm .
well you know .
well you know it .
it does make sense it does indeed .
and chris i am truly amazed .
and i &apos;m not just blowing smoke .
you talk about being homeless and shit in your pants homeless to where you are today .
you &apos;ve made major strides .
and i think you can continue to make those i know it &apos;s hard but i think you can continue to move toward that hope into the spectrum .
the other thing that occurs to me is it sounds like you &apos;ve got a lot of thoughts and feelings that you haven &apos;t really been able to deal with too much .
have you thought about ever considered doing any counseling or therapy does that help at all .
are you .
okay great .
well i really want to encourage you to maintain that and keep with it .
because that will help too .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
no .
well maybe .
right .
sure .
turning point .
well and you .
oh my .
saw you .
well that &apos;s nice of them .
well it sounds like even if the crisis intervention program ends they may be able to get you connected to something hopefully more ongoing .
what &apos;s our discussion today been like for you how do you feel about that .
well what i &apos;d like to do is give you a call in about a week or so just to touch base won &apos;t be a long conversation .
but just to kind of see how you &apos;re doing and seeing if anything from today &apos;s conversation has come up or stuck with you or anything that any other changes that you might want to make .
you can have this if you &apos;d like .
and this is a list of treatment resources that you may already know a lot about .
and if you want that you can have that too okay .
you &apos;ve already got your card so i &apos;ll give you a call in about a week .
okay it looks like it &apos;s working clark .
alright so thanks again for joining us on this study it &apos;s helpful to get as much help with this as we can .
do are you .
and so it went okay out there taking the dast .
are you familiar with the dast at all .
yeah basically drug abuse screening test .
yeah it was the ten question survey .
very good .
yeah and so it scores you from one to ten measuring risk from substance use .
okay you scored a three .
that was on this test basically meaning you incur moderate risk from substance use .
does that sound about right or .
oh okay .
be any at all .
have hep c .
and then also the medical marijuana and mushrooms .
just once .
yeah .
okay .
okay .
but since i was a harm reduction counselor and i helped people to make sure that they didn &apos;t pick the wrong ones i &apos;m pretty sure that i &apos;m .
then it &apos;s .
you can pick them out .
okay .
so you feel pretty confident about picking out the shrooms so to speak .
anything else about mushrooms that would concern you .
anything along the lines of the effects that .
no .
mm-hmm .
oh okay tell me more about that clark .
back in the what sixties .
ahh .
ahh .
then it became a problem .
so .
and so you got addicted to heroin .
mm-hmm .
what happens afterward .
so how long then were you using the cocaine after that then .
was it cocaine .
i mean sorry i mean the heroin .
after the thirteen years .
so you went into methadone treatment after that spread .
oh i see .
oh so in and out .
numerous times .
so that was it that was the main .
factor .
okay .
so that &apos;s what helped you lick the heroin after that stretch of methadone treatment .
mm-hmm .
wow .
wow .
and so no heroin since .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
since that time .
mm-hmm .
okay .
and what &apos;s kept you on the straight and narrow in that regard .
number two i became a chemical dependency counselor so i understood all about the problem .
is it yoga .
uh-huh .
but you find that helpful .
yeah .
.
that &apos;s the hardcore version of what you &apos;re talking about .
okay okay i &apos;m not .
familiar but .
basically you &apos;ve found ways to relax other outside of .
okay .
insight .
you have that insight .
excellent .
and it &apos;s working for you .
yeah .
yeah .
so yeah you haven &apos;t had the heroin in many years .
occasional mushrooms come the season yeah .
and then are you getting medical marijuana .
through .
okay .
okay .
.
okay so your concern the three that you scored is basically around the alcohol .
yeah .
mm okay .
but you know that yeah .
oh are you i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s .
mm-hmm .
wow .
mm-hmm .
it &apos;s a lot .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah you work in that field .
and i know what you mean there clark .
so tell me so all of that along the lines of going through the divorce that &apos;s made it everything seems like it &apos;s come together to make it hard for you not to drink .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
not not .
.
okay .
boy you &apos;re going through you &apos;re going through a lot of different things with family members that &apos;s gotta be .
so that complicates things as far as your alcohol use .
for you to take .
mm .
you got a good background to help you deal with those kind of things i &apos;m impressed actually .
can i ask then where are you right now with .
because you mentioned you want to quit once and for all .
where are you in that right now .
mm tell me what you were thinking .
i wanna quit once and for all .
mm-hmm .
okay .
okay .
so you .
yeah you &apos;ve made that decision .
what about the alcohol clark .
yeah .
.
what would it take .
or what would you need .
mm-hmm .
about eleven days .
yeah .
yeah .
okay .
okay .
exactly exactly .
.
so there &apos;s a couple strong things to fall back on yeah .
i was a smoking cessation counselor too .
oh okay okay .
exactly .
exactly .
time to get out of there .
okay interesting .
it sounds like okay you &apos;ve made a decision not to use drugs as a coping mechanism because you have something to fall back on but the alcohol you &apos;ve made a decision it &apos;s just a matter of when .
yeah yeah .
would it help you if all these other social issues with your wife and your son were more .
yeah yeah yeah so that would make it easier .
so definitely .
am going through yeah .
okay .
okay .
mm .
yeah .
yeah .
impulsivity .
oh you &apos;re .
.
somebody else .
.
mm .
mm .
huh .
you do you have good insight .
you got a conscience i mean yeah i mean not a lot of people would think of it that way .
can i ask was that one sixty fourth up north way up north .
yeah i know where that is .
yeah yeah .
you were just up there .
okay .
okay .
so yeah just an example good example of your insight and your .
you reacted but you thought about it afterwards .
.
ahh .
.
well her .
mom wasn &apos;t setting a good example .
i know that that .
whoever came up with that intersection was not thinking straight at the time .
it &apos;s ridiculous coming off the freeway .
people on the .
freeway trying to go across people who are already in the lane are trying to get into walmart .
it &apos;s ridiculous .
i could see where you got caught so .
alright so well we &apos;re actually a bit over .
but i you &apos;ve got a lot of insight i mean it &apos;s not the things you do don &apos;t happen without you thinking about them .
definitely you &apos;ve given me a lot of information in that regard .
i wish you luck with that and i hope things calm down for you .
it sounds like a tough time right now but .
hopefully it &apos;ll .
yeah .
that was it huh .
when i got in prison some of the counselors in there they were saying now what did you do .
hard core .
good for you .
yeah study .
mm-hmm .
wow .
you .
took advantage .
good .
okay .
okay .
good for you good for you .
to think also .
good for you .
hey still you made yourself known .
so .
good for you .
well i won &apos;t keep you longer but i do want to follow up with you in about a week just to see where we are .
basically based on the fact that you made up your mind that you &apos;re not gonna use anything to help you cope other than the mechanisms that you &apos;ve already come up with .
and then you &apos;re still dealing with the alcohol issues .
and i know a week might be kinda soon for anything different .
but i wanna just check in with you anyway .
along with and then jessica will follow up with you with those other actual appointments .
exactly .
can i just call you .
does jessica have your phone number .
or i could jot it down real quick clark .
okay .
why don &apos;t it yeah let me call the number that works best for you .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
okay .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
great does jess have your home phone .
does she have that one .
maybe she didn &apos;t have it .
well i can get her both of these then .
because we want to be able to .
.
isn &apos;t that the first one you gave me .
that &apos;s your room phone .
so room .
cell and then house .
okay .
i &apos;ll go ahead and turn this off here .
there we go it looks like it &apos;s working .
so as i mentioned i totally wanna just get your take on how this has been going with what it looks like is marijuana and alcohol daily it looks like .
and you &apos;re fine with discussing those .
i was wondering is there one more than the other that you &apos;d be more open to discussing .
it &apos;s .
oh okay .
okay .
then it stops .
so you never get sick or .
like you said .
sloth is a good term .
yeah could i ask about six months ago .
you mentioned this started six months ago .
what was going on and .
and that happened six months ago .
okay .
the alcohol you turned to alcohol .
okay .
you had been drinking but it increased at that time .
huh .
it &apos;s not like .
that you need it so bad that it &apos;s a knot in your stomach .
tell me about how .
you say the marijuana &apos;s different from the alcohol .
tell me about then how .
because you do marijuana daily also it looks like .
tell me how that comes about then .
if you .
if your girlfriend didn &apos;t smoke .
you wouldn &apos;t even bother with it .
okay and you did you mention other acquaintances too that smoke .
really .
really because of the alcohol or because of the marijuana .
or because of something else .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
okay .
you smoke weed .
and it turns out being daily pretty much .
.
ah .
okay .
so you what i &apos;m hearing is you drink for yourself and you smoke because she &apos;s with you .
and you could more easily eliminate the marijuana than the alcohol .
have you given thought to not smoking with her .
yeah .
.
so you don &apos;t even really think about it when you smoke with her .
it &apos;s not as if i shouldn &apos;t be doing this or it &apos;s not as if well on the other hand it &apos;s not if i shouldn &apos;t be doing this you don &apos;t really think about it you just do it right .
mm .
really .
and do you ever tie the two together the marijuana and the alcohol .
or is it as cut and dry as you say where it &apos;s the m j is associated with your girlfriend .
you don &apos;t tie em together okay .
you don &apos;t smoke and drink at the same time .
oh you do .
mm .
your tolerance is .
and what are you drinking .
oh so whiskey basically .
beer no .
hmm so i hate i &apos;m sorry if i keep returning .
but marijuana doesn &apos;t do the same thing for you that alcohol does .
mm .
oh .
and so you &apos;re self limiting just out of physiologically you &apos;re self limiting .
it &apos;s not as if you have to make the decision i &apos;m done you just kind of nod off .
and what types of things have you noticed over the past six months that are a result of your raised consumption of the alcohol .
you just notice your tolerance is just really high .
health wise .
.
so you feel it back there .
oh any does your girlfriend have any thoughts or .
reaction to you .
hmm okay .
yeah yeah i was gonna say .
well well .
can i ask you .
let me ask you why .
yourself .
no why do you think she needs to stop the weed .
mm-hmm .
does that affect you in that way .
the weed .
but that &apos;s what .
mm-hmm .
.
oh the opposite .
so even though you do smoke it together you inevitably end up doing different things and reacting different .
naomi mentioned your naomi .
does she live with you .
your thoughts about that with your smoking and drinking .
mm-hmm .
oh is .
she in high school now .
.
but she knows .
wow .
wow .
wow .
wow .
does she ever say anything about marijuana to you .
really .
okay .
and what &apos;s your feelings on that .
you feel bad it makes you feel bad .
does she approach is she approaching both of you in this regard or just dad .
yeah okay .
wow oh .
your form that you filled out with naomi states that you don &apos;t want it to be a habit anymore but you want to be able to use occasionally .
and is that accurate .
do you think that &apos;s possible .
yeah i was wondering .
so you want to but you &apos;re not feeling totally confident about it .
so it sounds like you &apos;ve been thinking about it a lot and it &apos;s just very difficult for you because it &apos;s such a for the past six months especially it &apos;s been such a big part of your life .
the marijuana not so much .
i mean .
from your standpoint we don &apos;t even need to talk about it .
yeah .
really .
that says a lot .
it it .
because it helps you cope better de-stress or whatever you .
really .
it &apos;s that hard for you .
so that makes it doubly hard .
can i ask you in what context you were talking to pam .
mm .
mm .
i mean was she your provider at the time .
cause i know she &apos;s .
okay .
oh really .
in this clinic .
because i know .
but not .
but you &apos;re not seeing her anymore are you .
is it on your appointment slip there .
is that an appointment slip .
oh doctor thompson .
yeah .
do you anticipate bringing this up to her .
okay .
all right so what have you tried so far michael .
trying to quit .
okay that might be part of it right there .
you just haven &apos;t had the right .
you were gonna try the willpower thing .
yeah .
you quit cigarettes on your own .
cold turkey .
wow .
but this was different .
ah so there &apos;s others that you &apos;ve seen .
that was .
wow okay .
and it &apos;s yeah i don &apos;t often hear somebody say they like it .
i hear i need it a lot or it helps it &apos;s just interesting that you phrase it that way .
and that &apos;s how you feel obviously .
and but it &apos;s interesting that you &apos;ve quit the cigarettes .
is that what it is .
yeah .
so that .
wasn &apos;t hard because it tasted nasty to you .
you &apos;re .
one of those folks who .
it just wasn &apos;t .
yeah what about .
can i ask .
so have you detoxed from alcohol .
yeah .
yeah .
so with the i mean did you physically go through detox .
yeah .
.
so .
so still it was more that you just were itching to have it more than it wasn &apos;t the physical discomfort of detoxing that made you go back it &apos;s just you just constantly want it .
and nothing else is like that to you the marijuana or the cigarettes obviously .
because nicotine addiction is usually real tough for folks .
not for you though .
.
wow .
it was huh .
okay so have you thought about treatment .
okay .
but what will tell you you &apos;re ready .
mm-hmm .
which you need to be .
yeah .
can i what is your medical coverage michael .
so do you have d s h s .
yeah okay .
can i give you some resources at least about treatment .
and you say you need to be in that space .
to wanna do it .
okay and then we have a chemical dependency counselor in the clinic too yeah that your doctor can refer you to .
okay but you &apos;re absolutely right you have to be ready to do it .
there &apos;s different stages .
and it doesn &apos;t sound like you &apos;re at that stage yet where you &apos;re quite ready to take the action .
but when you are i mean you have funding so there &apos;s programs out for you .
there &apos;s always the helplines and then there &apos;s other local programs .
so i &apos;m gonna give this to you .
whereabouts do you live .
so you &apos;re up north .
and how do you usually get around .
mm .
do you know seattle very well .
do you okay because most of these are king county .
do you .
okay well i &apos;ll give you this .
so kind of your situation looks like mainly you do both alcohol and marijuana but marijuana is something that you &apos;re not even concerned about you do it basically because your girlfriend does it it &apos;s available you wouldn &apos;t do it at all if she didn &apos;t do it .
the alcohol it &apos;s just almost impossible for you to quit you actually like it .
and you contemplated stopping you &apos;ve got your daughter asking you to stop you know you need to stop but you &apos;re just not at that stage right where you &apos;re ready because that if you &apos;re not ready you &apos;re set up for .
failure .
but at the same time you &apos;re not really sure what will make you ready .
is it more would it be maybe more from your daughter .
would it have to be something medically .
to get to you .
and you just you can &apos;t see being addressing it before that .
you just like it so much .
okay .
i could i hear you i hear you so very interesting michael so yeah hold onto that .
those are resources .
oh i guess i thank you for sharing .
i know it &apos;s not always easy .
what i &apos;d like to do is in about a week if i could call back and just basically a one week follow up on what we talked about .
see how you &apos;re doing see if anything &apos;s changed see what stuck with you about what you and i talked about .
and then from then on naomi and her team will continue to follow up with you on this study to see how you &apos;re doing .
did she explain that to you .
and each time you &apos;ll get compensated also for helping us out and giving us your time .
because time is valuable .
i can vouch for that today .
so we have your contact number don &apos;t we .
is it a cell or is it your landline .
oh okay the one you have there .
i &apos;ll look to give you a call approximately a week from now i hope .
is there a best time during the day .
really okay and yeah it &apos;ll just be brief it won &apos;t even be as long as today .
great how long we &apos;ve we &apos;ve been talking about twenty five minutes .
boy that went by fast .
so any questions about this michael .
you &apos;ve been very forthcoming and i appreciate that .
okay .
all right so the recorder is on .
and i just want to start by thanking you for agreeing to do this study .
and you filled out some paperwork with jessica .
and she .
right right and then she gave you a score about and it was related to the answers that you gave regarding your drug use .
and this is yours if you want it but .
so does this surprise you .
okay so do you want to tell me a little bit about what &apos;s going on when you &apos;re .
looks like from here you say you use methamphetamine and marijuana and alcohol .
okay .
yeah so tell me a little bit about how often you &apos;re using and .
briefly .
mm-hmm .
so how long ago was the last treatment .
just push that to the .
okay .
well i &apos;m not so it sounds like you were drinking and smoking the pot .
what &apos;s .
okay .
and it made you feel better .
okay so what was the threat that was approaching .
so it sounds like you &apos;d like to be around some quality people and you &apos;d like to have a better life .
and you don &apos;t feel that that &apos;s happening for you .
mm-hmm .
mm .
is that something .
that getting married finding the right people is that something you want .
you .
you do .
mm-hmm .
you didn &apos;t want what to .
uh-huh .
so it sounds like you have a picture in your head of where you wanna be .
and you have your faith that kinda tells you where you wanna be .
mm-hmm .
so .
okay it really sounds like you &apos;ve thought about this a lot .
so you .
can &apos;t give up anything it sounds like you can &apos;t give up something to attain this goal .
that you yourself feel that there &apos;s something in you that &apos;s keeping you from going after this goal .
.
so .
when you think about this goal is there anything that you think about .
is there ever any time that you think about it and think hey i could do this if only you &apos;d made some sort of change or .
what do you ever see yourself achieving the goal in any time you &apos;re thinking about this .
it you talk about the disconnect .
i &apos;m just wondering if there are times ever when you think about your goal the family and changing your life going to is there any time you see that in your head and see it attainable .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
so .
and how could it happen .
mm-hmm .
now .
how is it helping you .
how is doing the drugs helping you .
tell me that .
yeah okay so when you finished the treatment a year ago did you have any time half a year ago .
okay .
half a year ago you finished the treatment and you came out and what happened .
you were .
so let me understand it a little bit .
so when you think about your life dream it sounds like which is the family and the connection with your church and .
okay .
farm .
okay that &apos;s new .
and when you don &apos;t think about those things when you &apos;re in treatment as .
you kinda have them out there as a goal but it sounds like you haven &apos;t ever sorted out the ways to get to that .
so the .
and the goal setting when you &apos;re in treatment is .
you don &apos;t have any goals when you &apos;re in treatment you yourself .
because you sound like you &apos;re a great you &apos;ve got great ideas and great thinking .
so when you you don &apos;t it doesn &apos;t sound like you participate in making the goals when you &apos;re in treatment .
because you kinda said to me that when you came out of treatment there were no there were the other people &apos;s goals and you weren &apos;t happy when you were in treatment so .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
your .
other goals the .
the good goals that you &apos;ve set for yourself .
so are the drug goals bad goals .
let &apos;s get let me clarify that .
so the drug use is aimless and headed for a wall .
and the good goals are .
mm-hmm .
so .
it doesn &apos;t sound like the aimless and headed for wall doesn &apos;t sound very good .
so you don &apos;t like it really .
would you ever change it .
that is your goal to change it .
and how would you do it .
without thinking about the a a or people setting goals for you because you do have goals you clearly have your own goals .
right .
right .
okay .
i .
i wanna hear what you think .
i don &apos;t care about the committee or anything because yeah i wanna know how what you would like to do to get off drugs .
excuse me .
so when you go back to the church and in the fall and say to them hey i &apos;m here i want the help i want the support are you still gonna be using drugs .
or is your plan to go back there not using .
okay .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
well that &apos;s .
good huh .
not exactly .
right .
who are they that you &apos;re telling this to .
the a a .
groups .
okay .
so the power is in your hand .
in your mind the power is in your hand .
in your mind .
okay so and you &apos;ve it sounds like you &apos;ve from the time you got out of treatment six months ago you &apos;ve come right back to .
have you come back to where you were using drugs before or are you still somewhere below where you used .
where when did you last use the most .
drugs .
mm-hmm .
and when was the last time you used some meth .
okay .
is that less than .
a year ago .
okay .
so have you cut back on your own .
is it consciously cutting back .
okay .
that &apos;s good .
do you care .
okay .
okay so you care about how you behave and your response to drugs .
mm-hmm .
mm .
so tell me how that &apos;s working for you .
the slamming the dope and it &apos;s and .
and control and .
and being able to live in society .
so the people are shunning you even though you feel that you could use the dope and still participate in society .
okay .
but you didn &apos;t like shooting the dope in front of your kids .
so it sounds like you &apos;re constantly arguing with yourself in some respect .
because it feels to me like you &apos;re saying some things that are contradictory .
it &apos;s like you &apos;ve got a yin and a yang black and a white arguing all the time in your head .
who &apos;s gonna win .
and .
that .
who is that who .
okay .
a third .
let &apos;s go with a third .
.
and how are we how would you get there .
how would you get there .
ahh so it has to be done for you .
mm-hmm .
do you ever think you &apos;re deluding yourself in some of this .
.
yeah .
but some people may .
sometimes a little bit more than others i mean .
right .
mm-hmm .
right you do .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm and yet still use the drugs .
mm-hmm .
now do you .
do you ever .
do you ever cut back on your drugs .
how often .
a day .
so marijuana seems to be the biggie .
is marijuana here the drug that .
what &apos;s your primary drug of choice here .
this the alcohol the pot or the dope .
yeah .
they &apos;re all .
equal .
mm-hmm .
mm .
your home theater in your mind when you &apos;re living in the shelter .
yeah .
yeah .
oh .
what are you gonna do tomorrow .
what are you gonna do tomorrow that &apos;s different from today .
okay .
even though you sound like you have this sort of goal to go to school in the fall and .
uh-huh .
and what will happen when they find out or like you say when you show up and they see that you &apos;re using the drugs .
because you do say you do recognize you &apos;ve said this to me that some people see you but they don &apos;t see you because all they see is maybe the drug use and how you &apos;re acting .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm and is that gonna include going in there using drugs .
on a daily basis .
okay .
so .
at some point it sounds like then that you &apos;re gonna cut back before this class starts in the fall .
you have .
right .
yeah yeah well derek i hope it works for you in the fall .
i really really hope it works for you in the fall .
and it sounds like you &apos;ve really really thought this through .
i mean you do you have some really good goals and you kinda know how to get there but i my only concern .
and may i express my only concern .
is that you do it for show when you do wanna straighten up you do it for show for other people and not .
you &apos;ve got all of these wonderful internalized thoughts .
but when it comes to doing something that might get you to the goal that it just feels like you &apos;re able to put on the show you &apos;re able to do the show .
and that &apos;s but if it helps you cut back that &apos;s good too .
i mean i just .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so you wanna know how to internalize it .
and i think that &apos;s different for everybody .
but for some but you have internalized your beliefs your religious beliefs because those are really things that you want to live by or you want to attain .
so somehow you &apos;ve internalized those right .
.
how did that happen .
and that would be my guess is the same way you &apos;re gonna internalize the next step .
whatever you however you &apos;ve internalized the other goals and dreams your beliefs is the way you &apos;re gonna need to maybe internalize the next step for you .
well that &apos;s good .
and that &apos;s all that &apos;s all i that was my good suggestion or my mediocre .
anyway so this is yours if you want it .
but it sounds like you already .
and this is some information if you would like this on programs around here that jessica left .
now did she explain to you that we &apos;re gonna call you in about a week .
okay well i &apos;m gonna call you in a week .
and just kinda follow up and see if you &apos;ve thought some more about some of the things we &apos;ve talked about .
and i thank you for doing this with us .
so i &apos;m gonna stop the recording .
okay here we go .
again thanks much .
the screen test that jessica gave you is called a drug abuse screening test .
do you have questions about that little ten questions she asked you .
okay okay good so you scored a seven .
she told you that seven out of .
oh she didn &apos;t tell you that .
you scored a seven out of ten which means you have severe risk of some type from substance use .
does that ring .
do you does that make sense to you .
we &apos;re talking possible medical risk possible psychological risk .
that something negative like illness medical condition some kind of psychological problem .
not necessarily die but just risk yeah .
yeah yeah oh yeah .
and this is in the context of the substance use though .
.
okay so i &apos;m seeing she wrote down feels addicted to morphine oxys he &apos;s prescribed but doesn &apos;t endorse abusing them .
and then marijuana use .
okay so tell me a little bit more about that about .
you say you feel addicted but you &apos;re not gonna endorse .
ahh .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah yeah .
mm .
yeah .
same yeah okay okay .
yeah yeah vicious cycle .
yeah wow .
yeah this hospital is .
yeah it &apos;s different you don &apos;t have the availability you don &apos;t have the control you have when you &apos;re in the hospital .
again .
yeah and you don &apos;t even want to get up you know .
and when did you get out of the hospital charlie .
the cycle .
has been just since then .
yeah .
oh boy .
and yeah that &apos;s a long time to be in that type of cycle .
so .
.
okay okay .
okay .
okay .
yeah oh .
oh i &apos;m sure after three years you definitely know because your body telling you .
car okay okay .
good good .
okay .
pain .
yeah you &apos;re at that point huh .
what about the marijuana .
does that help .
uh-huh .
okay okay .
okay .
yeah .
oh .
garden .
wow wow no that &apos;s great .
so that &apos;s part of your thought to keep busy yeah stay busy get out there .
well the gardening is good because you use both your brain and your body .
yeah yeah .
you &apos;re .
yeah .
oh .
from moving around .
but it &apos;s a good sore .
although aside with your other pain unfortunately so .
okay .
and you &apos;re doing this all by yourself .
yeah wow .
wow .
how .
how often do you get out to work in the yard and the garden .
oh you do .
you &apos;re doing doing a lot better .
just relax .
that &apos;s what .
i think a lot of people want to be able to do with their yards and their .
yeah i know nice you do get out there more i &apos;m sorry charlie this pager just keeps going off .
so so i &apos;m sorry you were also mentioning you said if .
and i think i kind of .
let &apos;s see you were talking about how at first the marijuana made your broken jaw pound .
you got to the point where it did help your pain .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
well yeah just the fact that you &apos;re able to move around .
more .
make love not war .
so how often would you say you smoke marijuana .
twice a day .
yeah so for you it does help .
yeah yeah .
yeah because moving around you mentioned you &apos;re gonna get out in the garden like you do .
yeah .
.
so true so true .
and yeah and you &apos;re actually getting out and doing more than a lot of people who don &apos;t have any problem .
you know .
okay .
.
ahh .
yeah yeah you .
yeah yeah you weren &apos;t gonna find any of that money in your bed that &apos;s for sure .
yeah like i say you &apos;re out there more than a lot of people who don &apos;t have any physical .
oh .
then you were out and around .
you don &apos;t use the chair anymore .
oh it broke .
do you still have a caretaker .
do you okay is it through copes .
no .
caretaker so who is all at home .
you your wife your caretaker .
oh okay .
oh okay okay and you mentioned a niece but she &apos;s not in the home .
oh she &apos;s .
there too .
who lost the fourteen dollars .
yeah okay .
daughter .
okay okay so you &apos;re never alone at any particular time when you &apos;re home .
not really huh .
somebody &apos;s around okay .
yeah good good .
okay .
how often do you have the caretaker .
how often .
during the week .
they stay just during the day or .
oh okay .
okay .
okay .
great .
any you pretty much that &apos;s a whole day spent when you .
so you do .
stay pretty active .
you &apos;re yeah yeah if you &apos;re not in the yard .
and she doesn &apos;t necessarily wanna do that .
.
you got .
we gotta find you a hardware store and a grocery store next to each other .
really .
oh that &apos;s right you &apos;re a car guy as well as going out in the yard and .
you have a car .
do you .
what year .
okay i had a seventy eight .
i had a seventy eight yeah .
yeah .
yeah yeah .
.
you could .
yeah .
yeah i had that was a great car it had a great ride for .
yeah it actually was my dad &apos;s and i got it from him .
and i &apos;d probably still have it if i didn &apos;t need a backseat .
well i needed the backseat .
for a .
family yeah yeah .
but otherwise i &apos;d probably still have that thing if it was still running seriously .
yeah .
it &apos;s a nice looking car .
it &apos;s a tradeoff too because you got a lot of room in the back to carry stuff .
not people but room in the back .
yeah so do you get to work on cars much .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah don &apos;t go taking that on without a lot of help so .
i have a mother-in-law who could probably pick up that motor for you .
she &apos;s funny she hauls around boat engines even at sixty nine years old she &apos;s interesting so .
but yeah the more i talk to you the more i realize you &apos;re a real active guy .
i mean i mean you had i &apos;m sorry we had to haul you in here .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
it was a process for you over time huh .
right now .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah you &apos;re .
so this is part of just your whole approach to dealing with how things are how things are going for you right now .
and hopefully like you said you want to be able to clip off this dependency and stuff down the line .
and you &apos;ve made big inroads in that regard as far as everything that you do .
i mean you you &apos;ve been pretty busy yeah .
yeah .
okay .
yeah .
i &apos;m not even gonna worry about how far i walk you around this clinic now you handle it no problem yeah yeah .
and how did you do after the .
no no just recently you had the colonoscopy you said .
that went okay okay .
good good .
because jessica said that that &apos;s we were trying to coordinate seeing you after the colonoscopy and such so .
.
oh .
okay no .
i appreciate your persistence charlie because .
okay .
are they .
with you here now .
oh .
she &apos;s downstairs .
okay i &apos;m going to yeah i &apos;m gonna look to tie things up .
i don &apos;t want to keep you .
but can i call you in about a week just to touch base .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
is this the same number .
okay .
does jessica have this number too charlie okay .
i &apos;ll do that .
so time of day .
is there a best time of day for a busy guy .
i get here about eight .
really okay .
okay .
and we &apos;ll just revisit more briefly just what you and i talked about .
and then jessica will be touching base with you like she said every three months .
okay i appreciate .
here we go .
so my name is carol .
i &apos;m the social worker in the clinic and i &apos;m also the interventionist .
so what we &apos;re gonna talk about today is the questionnaire that you did specifically the ten questions that we call the dast .
and just kinda talk about where you &apos;re at with substance use .
okay i &apos;m just gonna over here so it &apos;s not so central .
so did claire tell you what your score was on the dast .
do you want to know what your .
okay it &apos;s six .
that &apos;s a very good question .
i &apos;m glad you asked .
because that was the next topic of conversation .
so the dast is a measure of risk .
yeah it &apos;s a measure of a person &apos;s risk of suffering negative consequences as a result of their substance use .
yeah does that surprise you .
or does that seem like it &apos;s .
okay .
tell me more about why you agree that that is right on that you &apos;re at high risk for .
okay .
that &apos;s great .
mm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
so you felt like you you were really out there on your own .
yeah .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah yeah you have a lot going on .
so you are you do have housing now .
well good .
oh .
yeah .
yeah .
so and you use substances to escape this stress and .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so it sounds like and correct me if i &apos;m wrong that you regret i sensed some regret in your voice when you talked about relapsing and about .
well and yeah and yeah that &apos;s .
half of what i was gonna .
say .
that it sounds like you feel like things are too unsteady right now and unstable too stressful for you to feel like you can get back to sobriety .
yeah well .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
well and honestly any time a person chooses sobriety it &apos;s ultimately for yourself and not for anybody else .
okay .
okay .
why why .
do you say it sounds mean of you .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm okay so there is a lot of ambivalence in what you just said .
and that &apos;s .
the question what can you do .
so thirty day treatment is you &apos;ve already done that .
and you have the knowledge of a thirty day treatment program inside of you .
and the timing right now is not your life can &apos;t accommodate it and that makes sense .
so i guess at this point the question is not about whether you are clean and sober or not the question is whether or not you &apos;re able to reduce your risk .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm and stabilizing your life is gonna eventually get you back to sobriety .
but your life may not be stable and you could still reduce your risk in regard to your substance use if you choose to continue to use .
so my question to you is and you have the wisdom i don &apos;t have the answer for you .
what can you do right now to reduce your risk .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
well and you &apos;re talking .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
well .
and .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
.
yeah .
mm-hmm .
oh okay now i understand .
yeah .
okay well and just to back up a couple steps about what you were talking about earlier .
i said you have the wisdom of what you can do to reduce your risk .
and then you started telling me what you do you started talking about things that a person does when they &apos;re trying to maintain sobriety .
and i wanna make a distinction between sobriety and harm reduction .
okay .
and you talked about being able to make good decisions .
i agree people can make good decisions for themselves when they &apos;re actively using in order to reduce the risk of negative consequences .
so i &apos;m not talking about not using .
i &apos;m talking about in spite of your use staying safe .
yeah .
okay .
mm-hmm .
good .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
okay .
yeah .
okay .
yeah so you need to take her into consideration in your choices too .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay well .
mm-hmm .
yeah everybody needs support .
okay .
well i think that we can probably find some solutions before it gets to that point .
and so at this point i &apos;d like to ask if you &apos;d be open to hearing some of my suggestions .
okay so first of all you &apos;re doing a lot of things it sounds like you &apos;re doing a lot of things well you &apos;re trying to stay hooked up with mental health care for yourself .
and i wanna encourage you on that path follow up with sound mental health down .
yeah .
yeah .
right .
that &apos;s great .
okay .
oh g i u should be able to help you with that .
.
yes yes .
exactly okay the other thing that i wanted to mention is when you do choose to go to bars and when you do choose to make extra money make sure that you &apos;re practicing safe sex .
okay .
we have condoms in all our bathrooms .
take a handful .
good .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
well and are so i get what you &apos;re saying .
are you at risk to hurt yourself today or tomorrow .
no okay so again you &apos;re taking a step in the right direction by following up with your therapist .
okay .
okay .
okay good so you &apos;ve already taken steps towards .
good .
good .
okay .
okay can you think of any other harm reduction steps you might take .
okay and those are all recovery practices and i &apos;m talking harm reduction .
okay .
right .
oh so that &apos;s what .
and that &apos;s .
okay .
good .
mm-hmm .
and what would you do before .
what seriously what would you do before you &apos;re at the point where you &apos;re completely hopeless and hell bent on ending your life what steps would you take before .
so far .
good okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
okay .
you are doing the best and you &apos;re doing a lot of things to move forward .
and i think it &apos;s amazing actually what you &apos;re accomplishing given your level of stress .
so you &apos;re working on building a support system and that &apos;s one thing that you felt is not adequate .
but you are working to build that up .
so things are not gonna stay this way forever .
my next question is have you applied for low cost housing .
they &apos;re on a list .
who what .
okay so in outside of seattle it &apos;s king county housing authority .
okay and how old is your mom again .
okay so since your mom is included in your family you &apos;ll qualify for senior housing .
and that &apos;s there &apos;s another housing group senior housing assistance group .
i do and i can give you those .
mm-hmm .
well .
so yeah maybe they need to be .
yeah and maybe they need to be .
maybe you need to use a more directive approach i need housing help me get housing .
okay .
and you know what housing takes time so .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
okay well i &apos;m gonna give you these resources .
and just to kinda summarize what we talked about today so you &apos;re ambivalent about the fact that you &apos;re relapsed but you &apos;re not in a place right now to .
okay .
okay .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
and and .
and as back to summarizing .
that you &apos;ve talked about how these bigger issues if they felt more under control then you would feel .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm-hmm .
that &apos;s surprises me actually .
mm-hmm yeah .
mm-hmm .
did that work .
hmm .
yeah that &apos;s not fair is it .
well michael i wanna call you in a week .
and when is you said your appointment was on the eleventh with your .
okay and .
and what &apos;s a good phone number to reach you at .
uh-huh .
no no no yeah you &apos;re you &apos;re just .
expressing your emotions about everything you &apos;re going through .
i &apos;m not taking it personally i &apos;m just .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
that &apos;s how you &apos;ve .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
especially yourself i think what you &apos;re saying is that &apos;s to illustrate the desperation that you feel .
mm yeah .
well i &apos;m hoping that we can help alleviate some of this stress .
and what time is your appointment with your well not today the next week .
okay well i probably am gonna have her .
okay good so i &apos;m actually gonna have to call you before that .
i kinda wanted to call you afterwards to kinda make sure that you were able to make that appointment and see how you felt about the appointment .
i &apos;m actually gonna have to call you before .
um .
okay .
okay .
okay .
yeah okay i don &apos;t know what my availability is on the tenth .
yeah .
i &apos;ll leave you a voice mail .
but if you feel the need to talk you &apos;re welcome to stop in and if i &apos;m available i &apos;ll see you .
yeah .
so okay i &apos;m trying to .
write down these housing resources for you so i got king county housing written down .
and i &apos;m looking up senior housing assistance group .
okay and i think you would call their central office which is which they refer to as the discovery center .
so i &apos;ll write that down for you .
okay so there &apos;s a start of some resources that can hopefully get you where you need to be .
okay .
yeah .
you can keep that .
that &apos;s it &apos;s a blank there &apos;s nothing written on it you &apos;re welcome to keep it .
we i think i give these back to oh this is another page of resources for you that you &apos;re probably familiar with but we &apos;re giving that to everybody .
and then here is your thank you gift card for participating in this study .
and i think i need to give this back to the research assistant .
okay .
so i &apos;m gonna .
yeah i think you can use it anywhere .
yeah .
so it was really nice to talk to you michael .
i hope you found our conversation helpful in some way .
sure absolutely .
that &apos;s exactly .
yeah .
uh-huh .
okay well i &apos;m gonna let i &apos;m gonna stop this .
thank you again for taking the time to do this .
i know you probably weren &apos;t expecting to participate in a research study when you came here for your appointment today so .
and i know it &apos;s a lot of questions and took a lot of your time .
so thank you .
what did naomi tell you that we would be doing here today just the two of us .
okay well let me elaborate a little more .
we &apos;re looking to see how a brief conversation with a trained person whether it has any effect on someone &apos;s health outcomes .
so drug and alcohol use is one of them the services that people use here at the hospital or treatment elsewhere and different aspects of their lives in terms of health and employment social support .
all of the things that naomi asked you about earlier basically .
so you and i are just gonna talk here for up to thirty minutes a quick conversation .
and i &apos;m not here to tell you what to do or to make any changes .
if you decide to do that that &apos;s totally your call it &apos;s kind of on your own .
i &apos;m actually just here to learn more about you and how drugs fit in your life and kind of get a picture of how you like to use drugs or things you like or dislike really just be kinda like a sounding board to listen to how things work for you .
so how does that sound .
okay .
so naomi mentioned that in the past three days you &apos;ve used you drank alcohol you smoke marijuana daily .
yeah okay and that you are prescribed opiates but a few days you used more than your prescription and .
vicodin &apos;s an opiate .
.
.
sounds bad .
that &apos;s interesting .
and that when you ran out of your vicodin prescription you used a friend &apos;s yeah somebody else &apos;s oxycodone .
okay so why don &apos;t you tell me a little bit more about your marijuana use .
so for you marijuana is sometimes medicine sometimes just to get high .
okay .
it &apos;s a daily thing for you that you &apos;re used to .
okay .
so by nature you &apos;re naturally really fast moving and mentally physically and it benefits you sometimes when you &apos;re working but you don &apos;t always wanna feel like that .
being that way .
being that active has done .
so to fix that you &apos;ve turned to marijuana because it calms you down .
right .
calms you down more than you want .
so you like the way that it makes you calm gives you more patience and makes you tolerate more but .
makes you a little cloudy .
okay .
kinda sedating .
so on the one hand it &apos;s addressing your needs in terms of slowing down being more patient but on the other hand it &apos;s problematic and that you can &apos;t function the way you &apos;d like to .
and right now that benefits you more than being too aggressive and active .
because that &apos;s gotten you into trouble before .
just efficient .
so much going on and trying to get stuff done .
so you started taking medication to help with that .
okay .
and that was from your p c p .
your primary care provider .
dana .
okay .
and it was working for you .
oh no .
so one day it just stopped working .
so you finally could focus and take time and .
huh .
so they &apos;ve tried increasing the meds .
and it &apos;s still .
not helping .
do you wonder if maybe your previous drug use affects the way your body &apos;s tolerating medications now .
mm-hmm .
yeah that &apos;s an interesting question .
so it sounds like you &apos;ve been wondering .
yeah just that exactly .
hmm .
that &apos;s .
a really big change .
wow so you were around people who were heavy users .
so for about ten years or .
you used to like using crack .
okay .
yeah .
it &apos;s new for you .
hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
right .
.
they &apos;re real skinny .
blew .
up .
.
so they were fine at the time but then you stop using and then you when you stop using you have all these negative consequences .
huh .
so there was a reason to stop .
yeah .
so you think you &apos;re better off not using .
mm-hmm .
so you &apos;ve already you used to use crack cocaine and you were running around with people who were so far gone you didn &apos;t want that for yourself .
wow .
wow .
and you &apos;ve been everywhere .
and this was when you were using crack .
but something made you change and you don &apos;t use anymore .
is that .
can you tell .
me about that .
that &apos;s a really big change to make .
it sounds like you &apos;re at a very different place now picking up your girlfriend a car and .
okay .
okay .
but faith &apos;s important to you .
okay .
okay .
so your legal problems were a direct result of using .
sorry that must have been hard .
mm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
.
mm .
you knew .
tired of the cycle .
like a bad girlfriend .
.
.
okay .
i think it &apos;s pretty new when you started .
okay .
it sounds really familiar .
mm .
the same people .
yeah .
wow .
.
they were gonna get out and start all over again .
okay .
so you went in .
pretty pessimistic about it .
so you were expecting them to educate you .
about .
yeah .
okay .
but it wasn &apos;t like that .
.
yeah .
it was like a .
perfect fit for you .
so a combination of their program being a good fit making sense and the timing that you were just ready for a change but it worked for you .
before that .
mm .
shrug shrug it off .
yeah .
and you &apos;d hope that .
that was enough .
.
and is it .
worth it to me .
decision making .
yeah .
is it worth it is it not .
so for some reason that &apos;s a different beast it was really easy for you to say yes or no to crack cocaine but now it &apos;s .
socially acceptable .
alcohol &apos;s legal .
yeah .
.
yeah .
nobody thinks twice or questions that .
mm .
so it wouldn &apos;t affect your social groups .
so it is a different beast .
mm-hmm .
so you used to be around people who used crack and you didn &apos;t wanna be like them .
.
.
so far deep into it .
on your way down can &apos;t go backwards now that you &apos;re there .
but you have you &apos;re no longer in that toilet bowl but now you &apos;re in a place it &apos;s like you &apos;re in the bathroom and everyone in your everyone &apos;s in the bathroom using coke and .
it &apos;s normal .
yeah .
and you probably don &apos;t wanna change your social group you probably sit with your friends and .
what why do you wanna disassociate from them .
so you have very different kinda moral views and .
mm-hmm .
mm yeah that &apos;s not how you feel about .
so it sounds like these are your friends now or just people you have known for a long time have been through thick and thin they &apos;re not necessarily people you would choose to surround yourself with .
huh .
but you have other people that who fill that role for you .
mm-hmm .
defaulting .
to these buddies .
okay .
shaking your head .
mm what are your friends what &apos;s their drug use like .
so they don &apos;t use crack anymore okay .
okay so it &apos;s pretty .
functioning .
for the most part .
but again .
not going about it the way that you .
would want to .
you just wanna .
live authentically .
genuine .
to what you see your life being .
you just wanna live the life you see and just envision for yourself .
uh-huh .
just to have an honest life never have to worry about the things that you used to have to like look over your shoulder like you used to or .
you can sense it with every part of your being .
yeah it sounds like a .
so it sounds like you have a really solid idea of what you want for yourself .
what would it be like .
um .
interfering with your vision of your future .
so not only .
do you not you don &apos;t picture a life with alcohol or weed but it &apos;s also affecting the financial picture it &apos;s expensive .
with these things .
so you can &apos;t get there with alcohol or drugs in your life .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so for you two sixteen ounce cans is like it &apos;s pretty minimal .
mm-hmm .
and you woke up .
here .
okay .
you don &apos;t even like the feeling of it .
okay .
they go .
hand in hand .
so you probably wouldn &apos;t drink if you weren &apos;t smoking pot .
so what would that look like for you .
yeah what .
would stopping look like .
what would that involve .
what would it take to do that .
you just weren &apos;t .
the same person when when using it .
mm-hmm .
but alcohol and marijuana are different because you &apos;re still able you &apos;re still yourself for the most part you &apos;re still able to function for the most part it &apos;s socially acceptable .
i &apos;m sorry i probably interrupted .
.
i do that too .
well i imagine with crack you &apos;re probably not around it as often anymore .
because you mentioned your group of friends mostly use alcohol and pot .
so what would it be like to try and avoid alcohol and pot when everyone you are with use alcohol and pot .
so you couldn &apos;t still hang out with them and just not use as often .
mm-hmm .
so you tried that but you just can &apos;t stick around long enough because you &apos;ll wanna use again or they will give you a hard time .
okay .
so that &apos;s not an option that &apos;s been down that road .
i could see that being a difficult choice to make if that &apos;s those are your people the people you &apos;re around all the time .
not associating with these people .
because you &apos;re busy with other stuff .
but it was never intentional .
.
so for you a big thing will be if and when you decide you wanna try not using marijuana or if you wanna start a life without marijuana or alcohol a big thing for you will be changing who you &apos;re surrounding yourself with .
what else would affect using do you think .
yeah besides just the people you &apos;re around .
it &apos;s an exciting time .
.
it &apos;s a constant distraction but that took it away for you .
okay but what about your attitude you mentioned .
.
you were happy .
mm-hmm .
had some motivation to go do something .
so it &apos;s like because you &apos;re not getting the same effects from the mirtazapine you &apos;re turning to marijuana because it .
okay .
it &apos;s like a pacifier kinda .
yeah let me pause it .
so because the mirtazapine hasn &apos;t been working marijuana &apos;s been kind of a temporary fix .
so it sounds like in the past you &apos;ve explored this issue with your doctor she &apos;s always prescribed something to help out .
what has that been like lately because it hasn &apos;t been working .
the the new dose .
because suddenly everything was calm and clear for once in your life the first time in your life .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm hmm what has your marijuana and mirtazapine use looked like together .
i &apos;m curious about that .
do they go hand in hand for you .
or when you &apos;re using mirtazapine do you not use your .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
may i share something i &apos;ve learned about that .
this came up with somebody else and so i asked one of the doctors on our study if previous drug use would affect certain things later in life if they stopped drug use .
and he seemed to think that that &apos;s not the case .
and he &apos;s the addiction specialist over at .
h m h s .
that yeah people can stop using drugs and then they &apos;re they can go back to functioning before they were using .
um so .
but if it &apos;s something you &apos;re concerned about i &apos;m wondering if it might be worth bringing up with your primary care provider .
what do you think .
you think that &apos;s something you could talk to your primary care provider about .
you guys are pretty open .
about that stuff .
so he &apos;s been pretty helpful .
like sedating kinda .
makes you cloudy .
so it &apos;s possible that .
oh yeah .
.
just drowning in this blanket .
so for you it might be a combination of the mirtazapine and the marijuana that maybe isn &apos;t as effective as it used to be .
yeah .
i can imagine .
you &apos;re so far done with marijuana .
okay .
well we &apos;ve talked about it sounds like marijuana had a place for you and currently has a place as this blanket safety net comforting but not helping you .
but you wanna be done with it completely .
.
you were saying you were so thankful .
mm .
you &apos;ve been through so much .
mm-hmm .
so you &apos;re finally getting this clarity .
to the clarity .
you want that back .
okay .
okay so you &apos;re at a place where you &apos;re ready for that you probably appreciate that clarity more because of everything you &apos;ve been through and having never had that for the past forty years with everything you &apos;ve been through so .
okay .
so everything was .
at your fingertips you &apos;re financially secure didn &apos;t never had to worry about a roof over your head .
wow .
okay .
so he .
and now you can see how you can get to where you want to be .
so you want it so badly that .
long weekend .
it &apos;s really easy to fall back into that .
but you &apos;re you have a job .
yeah it sounds like if it &apos;s a change you wanna make you have the willpower to do it the you &apos;ve done it for crack .
okay you wanna take that .
oh no gotta make sure that &apos;s .
make sure nothing &apos;s on fire .
okay well i just want to see if i can summarize it sounds like to me you want to be done with marijuana and alcohol you &apos;ve already made some pretty big changes in your life having stopped using crack .
so if and when you decide you &apos;re really ready it seems like you definitely have this the willpower and your faith and strength to make those make changes .
but we &apos;ve talked about how other things in your life would have to change it sounds like your social group right now would make it really difficult to stop .
and it &apos;s i know we also explored the idea of i know you mentioned you might wanna talk to your doctor to see what he thinks about the marijuana and the mirtazapine if that &apos;s affecting how the mirtazapine &apos;s working or not .
but you think it is .
but it might be worth exploring with him just in case .
and then moving forward you &apos;re just gonna kinda see how it goes but there &apos;s no real plan at this point to you know stop or anything anytime soon .
there is so you &apos;d like to stop .
right .
would that be .
helpful for you .
you can &apos;t be going to church every day .
mm-hmm .
so you wanna have more of a life outside of .
yeah .
okay so we &apos;ve talked about some options .
can i share some other options that people have tried themselves or talked about with me .
oh okay .
okay well this can be really quick we don &apos;t have to talk about it all .
and it &apos;s totally your call .
because we have gone over a lot of stuff today so .
but if you &apos;d like to hear i can share a couple other options moving forward .
so one option is to not make any changes and just keep using the same way that you have been .
but it sounds like that &apos;s not really what you wanna do .
okay so that &apos;s we &apos;ll take that off the table .
another option would be to cut back use a little less than you usually do or use in situations that might be safer for you like maybe not when you &apos;re working but on the weekends only or .
i don &apos;t know what that would look like .
another option would be to seek treatment .
you &apos;ve been through that before for the crack .
i dunno if that would be helpful to you marijuana or alcohol but it &apos;s always an option .
i know there are more options than this for some reason i can &apos;t think of them okay .
keep using not doing anything oh quit completely just cold turkey stop entirely cut back seek treatment .
is there anything i &apos;ve left off that is a potential option .
okay so those are what do you think about all of those .
cold turkey .
yeah i like it .
toilet bowl .
dive in .
.
yeah .
you have to .
be ready and then you &apos;ll go and then you &apos;ll jump in .
.
so you &apos;re not going to walk in an inch at a time .
cutting back .
okay .
so you know that that won &apos;t work for you .
okay .
and for you you see that without help from other people .
with help .
okay .
what would the help .
.
okay so but you have a plan then .
.
get everyone on board help me hold myself accountable .
and if they don &apos;t support you .
okay .
so that &apos;s what it would look like for you .
you like you .
feel like you &apos;re getting closer and closer to getting ready .
mm .
well i &apos;m really glad we had the chance to talk .
and it sounds like you have a solid idea but what &apos;s quitting would look like for you in terms of deciding when you &apos;re ready and when you &apos;re ready telling all of your people look this is what &apos;s happening i &apos;m making these changes and then you &apos;re just at a point now where you &apos;re getting closer and closer to that day .
right .
okay .
yeah so do you have a timeline for when you &apos;d like to see yourself .
it &apos;s just still taking it day by day .
okay .
yeah so you &apos;re not there yet today but you could be there any day now .
mm-hmm .
so you would want an instant remedy to help you .
mm-hmm .
hmm .
of course of course .
well thank you .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry .
well i really thank you for taking the time to do this .
would it be okay with you if i follow up in a week up to you just check in and see how you &apos;re .
your plan &apos;s .
going .
if naomi got it from you then i &apos;ll have it too .
okay .
okay would are certain days better than others or .
okay okay so urbano first i want to talk to you a little bit about what you did today and learn a little bit more about what &apos;s going on for you .
and then of course alicia informed me that you told your doctor you really want treatment .
so we &apos;re gonna talk about that today too .
oh really .
yeah .
that &apos;s great .
okay so one of the things that you did today was a screening tool called the dast drug abuse screening tool .
and it measures the risk of harm that a person might experience due to their substance use .
and it &apos;s on a scale of zero to ten zero being no risk of harm ten being extreme or severe risk of harm .
where do you think you fell on that zero to ten scale .
okay you actually scored a six .
but you know what it &apos;s still within that same range .
so whether it was six or eight you &apos;d still be in that top category .
so tell me why you said eight .
what &apos;s going on that makes you feel like you &apos;re at severe risk .
uh-huh .
you &apos;re tired of drug use .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm to either one of those conditions or any or .
yeah .
okay have you .
i &apos;m not i &apos;m gonna misquote you .
but you said something to the effect of too much has gone on .
is that what you said .
oh okay .
uh-huh .
yeah so you &apos;re really aware of the potential for harm to your health by using substances and .
yeah .
yeah .
okay and you &apos;re really clear that you wanna stop .
or did you wanna just hopefully cut back .
or what &apos;s your goal .
you wanna stop .
okay what do you think is gonna be most helpful to you achieving that goal .
mm-hmm .
okay .
yeah .
okay so do you think you need to go back to a formal treatment program .
what kind of medication .
oh yeah .
it &apos;s hard .
yeah .
it &apos;s .
it &apos;s yeah yeah suboxone programs are far and few between .
and there &apos;s a lot of criteria to get into a suboxone program .
but that &apos;s what you &apos;re mostly interested in .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
so not methadone maintenance you don &apos;t want that .
mm-hmm .
okay .
okay have you ever talked to a doctor about that .
because the first thing that &apos;s i &apos;m curious about when you tell me you see a lot of people on oxygen i just wonder if they were probably smoking for a lot of years in addition to using and it just might be a coincidence that .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
and i certainly don &apos;t wanna sound like i &apos;m trying to talk you into that because i &apos;m not here to talk you into anything .
i just kinda wanna explore that a little bit more .
okay you want suboxone .
no .
that &apos;s okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay okay so suboxone or methadone if they &apos;re willing to put you on a lower dose than sixty .
and then would your goal be to taper .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
i hear you .
okay so that i can you &apos;re saying that with a lot of strength so i can tell that that &apos;s what you really want you really wanna be off medication .
okay well i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ll do i will .
i don &apos;t know very much about suboxone i gotta be honest .
but i &apos;m happy to look and see what i can learn today .
and then we can go down that road and if it looks like it &apos;s feasible we can get you started .
the other thing is this is not something that is probably gonna be immediately put in place today .
so .
so we have a c d counselor here in clinic that i can set you up to follow up with if you think that might be helpful .
do you wanna do that .
okay it &apos;s up to you .
if that &apos;s gonna be helpful .
okay let &apos;s see .
chemical dependency .
so she would be a counselor who would offer support follow up on what we start today .
okay .
okay i think i just have to .
let me also look into my trails to treatment .
i don &apos;t know if it has anything on suboxone it &apos;s a little bit outdated .
what &apos;s your insurance .
okay .
so you have a medical coupon .
which program are you on .
is this it .
okay .
it looks like yeah .
okay so you must receive do you receive medicare and then sometimes receive medicaid .
and do you know what you &apos;ve spendown it .
it looks like you &apos;re on .
yeah .
so your spend on six hundred .
so as soon as you .
accrue six hundred in medical bills you get on medicaid .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay let me see .
yeah this talks about methadone it talks a little bit about buprenorphine .
suboxone .
yup .
but it &apos;s not telling me about suboxone or buprenorphine .
programs .
yeah well it &apos;s a medication that &apos;s been around for a while but they &apos;ve just been recently using it more for opiate replacement therapy .
and again i know more about methadone than i do about suboxone .
so i &apos;m kinda and this is what happens all the time a patient comes in and they ask me about something and i may not know about it .
and so i have to educate myself while i &apos;m working with a patient .
so my trails to treatment is not very helpful .
okay well .
well apparently pioneer human services is providing suboxone but it looks like only for detox .
and are you .
i dunno .
oh okay .
which place .
okay .
oh i &apos;m sorry .
and when did that happen .
oh boy .
okay i &apos;m looking up pioneer human services .
see what it has to say here .
surprised it doesn &apos;t give any specifics about suboxone .
shall we give them a call .
well if we have time let &apos;s give them a call .
okay where &apos;s their phone number this is what drives me crazy about web pages they don &apos;t make it obvious where their phone number is .

oh yeah i &apos;ve seen that .
yeah .
so you &apos;ve gotten into the routine of smoking cigarettes when you take oxycontin .
yeah .
but you know you &apos;re concerned enough about your health it sounds like you do have .
i mean you talked about an attitude of not caring but it sounds like you do care somewhat about your health if you &apos;re taking these steps to .
yeah .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
so you feel sort of two ways about it you know it &apos;s unhealthy there &apos;s a number of things that are unhealthy but at the same time you &apos;re getting something out of it that you like you &apos;re getting a high you &apos;re getting .
so what are you gonna do about that .
what do you think you can do .
what do you mean by that .
are you talking about hurting yourself or .
yeah .
well i &apos;m just curious about what you want to do .
i mean i &apos;m not telling you what to do i &apos;m just .
that &apos;s penicillin .
right here yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
well you have you feel responsible here .
yeah .
.
so tell me are there things that you &apos;re thinking that you might want to change .
or what are some things that you might want to change about your drug use right now .
right .
feel like what .
like quitting oxy .
yeah .
oh .
right .
so it doesn &apos;t sound like you have any plans necessarily to stop .
no .
okay .
yeah .
and not because necessarily you don &apos;t want to but because you don &apos;t think you could .
yeah .
you do want to .
but you don &apos;t think you could .
what would it take for you to change your mind .
no .
less stress .
uh-huh .
hm .
that &apos;s an important date .
is that do you think they may change something .
no .
so medical issues sounds like it &apos;s a could be a factor .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
does she have .
what kind of insurance does she have .
v a .
does the v a offer any kind of in home care .
that might be worth checking out .
yeah .
it could give you a little bit of a break perhaps .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
wow .
mm-hmm .
she just doesn &apos;t go out .
maybe mix it up a little bit yeah .
well i tell you what larry i don &apos;t know that we i think we need to wrap this up .
i appreciate you sharing all that with me .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
oh .
huh .
huh .
huh .
wow .
yeah well that sure explains it .
uh-huh .
well you got a lot on your plate it sounds like you got a lot of responsibilities but you also wanna take care of yourself and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve been talking about .
and i appreciate that .
the next step here would be for us to have a brief conversation just about what we talked about today in about a week .
so if it &apos;s okay with you can i give you a call in one week .
what &apos;s your phone number .
all right so after about noon .
all right .
well we just need we &apos;d only have to talk on the phone you don &apos;t have to come down here or anything like that .
all right so lastly i guess this is an if you &apos;re interested i don &apos;t want to give this to you if you &apos;re not interested but it &apos;s a list of different drug and alcohol or sobriety supports in the community .
so if you &apos;re feeling like you &apos;re wanting to cut down or stop you can these are some resources .
and i can give this to you or i can just keep it .
yeah there &apos;s a twenty four hour drug alcohol help line .
there &apos;s some this is sobriety supports .
yeah .
whoa .
wow .
yeah .
that &apos;s pretty intense .
that &apos;ll cause some stress .
i think this is probably for you .
it &apos;s a review of HIPAA authorization .
and then if you have questions about anything you can call these people .
it &apos;s this consent that i &apos;m sure that she had you sign .
so do you want this .
i don &apos;t need .
i &apos;ll just give you these .
and i think kelsey or one of her co-workers will be getting a hold of you in a few months time .
yeah .
in a week .
all right .
well thanks for your time .
oh and i have to give you that .
that &apos;s a gift card .
there &apos;s a bunch of places on the back including fred meyer i think .
there we go so i &apos;m gonna move over here and set that here so as you know this project is to look at people &apos;s drug use and see how that impacts their lives .
and i just wanna kinda let you know i &apos;m not here to tell you what to do or to change your mind .
just wanna kinda have a little conversation with you about .
is that alright .
so one of the tests that you took was called a drug abuse what is it called drug abuse screening test .
and it kinda rates people on a scale of one to ten in terms of what their risk is and .
are you interested in knowing kinda what your score was and where you .
so it &apos;s on a scale of one to ten with zero being no risk and ten being high risk .
where do you think you placed .
okay .
so the test rates you on your .
uh-huh on a scale .
of .
right what score do you think you got .
if zero is no risk and ten is really high severe risk .
what do you think .
you think you &apos;re rated a five .
okay and would you characterize that as medium some moderate risk .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
hmm .
just .
yeah that it could become problematic or that it is problematic for you .
about five .
mm-hmm .
mm .
right yeah we &apos;re talking about you we &apos;re not talking about other folks .
yeah well interestingly your score was a two .
so that &apos;s some risk .
if you had been a five they would have said it would be moderate risk .
mm-hmm .
and the drug you use is marijuana .
is that right .
is that the only thing .
.
thirty days .
mm-hmm .
.
oh .
oh okay so you don &apos;t feel like you can become dependent on it or hooked or addicted to marijuana you can stop whenever you want .
mm-hmm .
mm .
sure .
hmm okay .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so tell me a little bit about your use .
you say i don &apos;t do it all the time i only use it every so .
when you wanna eat .
oh .
okay .
mm-hmm .
oh my .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
oh dear .
sure .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so you do that just to help kinda stimulate your appetite .
and get the munchies huh .
mm .
mm .
right .
and you ate that .
mm-hmm .
mm .
right .
mm-hmm .
don &apos;t do that yeah .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay so it sounds like you don &apos;t do it to relax or to get high or to have fun .
just do it when you notice that you &apos;re losing weight and you need to kinda boost your appetite .
and you don &apos;t do that even on a regular basis .
how often would you say you do smoke .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
oh my .
mm-hmm .
save it .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm .
mm-hmm okay .
do you see any down sides of it stimulating your appetite .
you talked about the good thing is that it stimulates your appetite but the bad thing is that sometimes you overeat .
mm .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
sure .
hmm .
so is there anything that .
are you concerned about the times that you do overeat that it might cause you medical problems .
mm .
you &apos;re just i &apos;m hungry i &apos;m gonna eat and .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah oh .
okay .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
.
i understand .
so you don &apos;t desire or need alcohol anymore you don &apos;t do that anymore .
mm-hmm .
ahh .
oh my .
mm-hmm .
whatever is left .
mm-hmm .
right .
sure .
yeah okay .
well i hear you that you &apos;ve really made some major changes in terms of stopping drinking and the only time you use marijuana now you said i &apos;m not addicted i don &apos;t even abuse it i just use it every once in a while to get hungry .
people believe that yeah .
some people believe you can .
more trouble than .
mm-hmm .
sure .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
sure .
mm-hmm .
right .
hmm .
yeah .
so you talked about the one you talked about how it helps your appetite and gets you to eat more so you don &apos;t lose weight but you also talked about it that it sometimes causes you to binge eat and eat more than your body can process .
any concerns about how you wanna deal with that .
or do you want to try to moderate that .
mm .
i &apos;m talking about by the using that you overeat then .
mm-hmm .
right .
sure sure .
so do you think that because you &apos;ve smoked the marijuana to help increase your appetite that it increased it too much .
and so is there a problem there for you for that .
mm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
hmm .
right .
hmm .
right .
mm .
so that has caused you a problem .
uh-huh .
in about five minutes .
minutes .
okay thanks .
uh-oh .
oh really .
whoops .
.
okay .
so the only thing that i hear you say is that on the one hand it helps boost your appetite which is good but on the down side is that you recognize that you overeat sometimes which can cause you medical difficulties .
and i &apos;m just wondering what do you wanna do about that if anything .
okay what &apos;s that .
oh .
and that goes down easier .
oh .
mm-hmm .
so then it won &apos;t come back up .
okay .
yeah so it &apos;s really important to kinda remind yourself even though i want the fried chicken and the other stuff i better eat the soup .
mm .
yeah .
sure .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
yeah .
okay .
which is what .
the overeating part you mean .
oh .
need some help .
there we are .
okay .
well thank you again .
i &apos;ll turn this off .
and here &apos;s your gift card .
any i think it &apos;s a q f c fred yeah there on the back it &apos;s yeah fred meyer kroger q f c .
okay .
good and do you want your score and resources .
okay .
alright .
don &apos;t wanna lose your ride .
oh .
okay .
it is twenty five til five .
do you need some help .
ahh .
.
alright sir thank you again .
you too .
you too .
it &apos;s kinda hard in this weather isn &apos;t it .
yeah okay so again my name is matt and i &apos;m a social worker here in the clinic .
and what i &apos;d like to do is if it &apos;s okay with you to talk a little bit about your drug use and how that &apos;s going for you or how you feel you like that &apos;s kinda been impacting what &apos;s going on with you .
and you did talk about how this is a lot of paperwork that you just had to do and just want to start off by asking what do you think about all that all those questions and all this paperwork .
all right .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm-hmm .
so you &apos;ve had some pretty serious consequences it sounds like as a result of your use .
mm-hmm .
so those the consequences that you &apos;ve mentioned include homelessness jail time .
theft right .
mm-hmm .
not necessarily knowing who to trust or who to go to .
yeah .
yeah .
can you talk to me .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t mean to interrupt .
okay .
mm-hmm .
so the people that you &apos;re in contact with around your drug use it sounds like has been some problems for you .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
you feel like there are more people out there using now .
mm-hmm .
yeah it sounds like it &apos;s a pretty serious lifestyle kinda commitment huh .
mm-hmm .
so you &apos;ve given me some motivations for wanting to change something .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
right .
okay .
okay .
all right so you &apos;re involved with treatment and you &apos;ve .
yeah .
yeah it &apos;s nice .
mm-hmm .
so you &apos;re going to n a meetings .
yeah .
right right .
right .
great .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
so you &apos;ve got a primary doctor and you &apos;ve been to .
oh you don &apos;t okay .
i see .
sure .
uh-huh .
right .
yeah it can be difficult to get in here .
but it sounds like you &apos;re pretty motivated .
you &apos;ve been to some smoking cessation classes you participate in n a .
and you also mentioned some other you do other things to help motivate you .
can you tell me a little bit more about what some of those things are .
mm-hmm .
i think easter &apos;s usually sunday .
mm-hmm .
who did who did .
mm-hmm .
right .
right so it &apos;s helpful for you to be around people who are going through something similar as you and kinda make connections .
yeah .
tell me more about that .
what does that mean .
it sounds like you have some you &apos;re motivated but at the same time there &apos;s some problems .
can you describe that .
okay .
so just your situation you &apos;re in is discouraging .
and you feel like that is a trigger for use .
yeah .
it &apos;s like one thing leads to the next thing .
right .
okay .
well that &apos;s a good thing yeah .
right .
okay you need some more you want some more support .
support right more treatment options .
okay .
can you .
i &apos;m interested .
tell me .
you say that &apos;s when you feel discouraged and you may meet up with somebody and one thing leads to another and then you use .
yeah .
yeah .
once you start .
it &apos;s hard to stop .
yeah .
yeah .
wow .
mm-hmm .
sure .
right .
uh-huh .
yeah .
right .
so you &apos;ve you &apos;re got a pretty good idea about wanting to stop and the consequences of using and that it &apos;s hard to stop when you start and i mean those are some negative things and you &apos;ve listed a whole bunch of them .
it sounds like the problem is what do you do now .
i mean have you thought about .
i mean other than the things that you &apos;ve mentioned .
mm-hmm .
.
well congratulations .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
you sound convinced pretty convincing that you &apos;re ready to change and .
yeah .
yeah .
where are you on a waiting list .
okay .
and these are .
i &apos;m sorry .
right .
are these treatment programs are ones that involve include housing .
is that right .
yeah yeah .
yeah and you &apos;re doing the right things to get involved in those programs .
and i know as you say it &apos;s frustrating because sometimes it can take a little bit of time to get in .
mm-hmm .
any other ideas about where to get the kinda support you need or how to get involved in treatment .
mm-hmm .
where &apos;s this .
right .
mm-hmm .
right .
that &apos;s kinda the best time to go is when .
yeah .
because those are the times when you may feel discouraged .
mm-hmm .
good well i certainly find that encouraging that you &apos;re not giving up .
and i can hope maybe accept some of that when you &apos;re feeling discouraged that you have got a lot of motivation for change and you &apos;re doing what you need to do .
i was wondering because you did all that paperwork and part of that paperwork was the screening test .
which scores people on kind of a severity or risk scale here .
and just so i can share this with you just so you know just for your information this test that you took was given to thousands and thousands of people .
and then they people their risk their risk for harm due to their drug uses is rated on this scale from one to ten or zero to ten .
zero is no risk and it kinda goes up and you can look at it one to two is some risk three to five &apos;s moderate risk and six to ten &apos;s severe risk .
and in terms of risk they mean problems that you may have medically injuries to yourself mental health emotional consequences .
and you &apos;ve talked to me already about some of these consequences that you &apos;ve experienced .
but in terms of your score your score was a nine which put you up in the severe risk rating .
and it sounds like you already have a sense of that to me .
yeah and you &apos;re ready to make a change and i tell you you &apos;re doing the things that you need to do .
um .
well i .
tell you we do .
i think you &apos;ve got an appointment here with in the adult medicine clinic .
and the adult medicine clinic here has some chemical dependency counselors and you could talk with them .
you can make an appointment .
um .
i don &apos;t know that you do .
so and i wanna give you this list of treatment resources .
okay and these are some things that you can access and some addresses and things all right so i &apos;ll give you this .
i think it depends it depends on the person .
it depends on what &apos;s gonna work for you or what &apos;s not and given .
mm-hmm .
and so where are you currently living .
okay .
immanuel lutheran church .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
all right do you have an income right now .
you get s s i .
okay .
do you have any other questions for me .
well i tell .
you it the clinic here is very .
mm-hmm .
well .
dana is a provider yeah he &apos;s a provider in the adult medicine clinic .
and he can prescribe you medication and all that stuff .
so i would think about him as a primary provider .
yeah .
yeah .
it &apos;s takes a while to get in here because it &apos;s so crowded .
yeah that &apos;s coming up yeah .
yeah and i tell you what and i would suggest to you when you come in on the thirtieth to again to talk to ask to talk to a social worker .
because this is part of the study and what we &apos;re doing here is part of and part of that study is kind of talking about your drug use .
but ask to talk to a social worker when you come back for that appointment .
and they can maybe .
to make an appointment for a social worker when you come in .
yeah if you want i would suggest doing that so .
i &apos;ll keep this and give this to you and this is for you to keep .
if you have questions you can talk to the social worker here .
yeah that &apos;s for you .
sounds like you &apos;ve got some good things set up .
you &apos;re doing what you need to do .
you &apos;ve got good motivation .
and i wish you the best of luck .
okay .
and this is for you .
i think you can go to kroger &apos;s or safeway .
it says it all down here all those places yeah fred meyer .
and the last thing i needed to set up with you is that i have to do a i need to do a i would like to do a follow up phone call with you in a week just to see how things are going .
and where can i call you .
okay .
mm-hmm .
sixty seventy one .
what if that &apos;s not working .
where can i .
all right .
what about is there a number at the immanuel lutheran .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay here &apos;s the number you can call you can leave it on this voice mail .
all right .
yup .
thanks for coming in and putting the effort in .
.
yeah then they &apos;re out there trying to get people involved in this study so .
stay involved .
and we &apos;ll figure something out .
all right have a nice day .
alright so it looks like it &apos;s up and running .
okay so i know that you like i mentioned answered a lot questions .
oh did you need to .
take it .
okay .
so i know that you went through a bunch of different questions with leah .
and the first set of questions were kinda like yes or no questions about drug use .
and so i was wondering sort of what thoughts might have come up for you as you were answering those questions or .
mm-hmm .
wow .
mm-hmm .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
oh they caught him okay .
okay .
okay .
and third one was supposed to be yesterday but the counselor laura she has to cancel it because she wasn &apos;t feeling good .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so .
okay .
mm .
mm .
mm .
so given what you &apos;ve described just going through so much having yeah i mean it &apos;s kind of parents &apos; worst fear right .
and then on top of that relationship dynamics .
.
yeah and maybe too it sounds like you &apos;re also saying that you feel isolated and you don &apos;t really have the support .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm and it sounds like you had hit a point too where you felt so overwhelmed that you actually ended up taking some tylenol and ending up in the hospital .
so obviously you &apos;ve seen really a lot of anxiety right .
yeah and it &apos;s a lot to deal with sure .
and so i think you had mentioned smoking marijuana .
so that &apos;s the substance the main substance you use .
okay and anything else or .
mm-hmm .
okay so .
for .
and so you had mentioned that on the one hand it helps with your anxiety but you also notice it doesn &apos;t make the problem go away .
mm-hmm .
so it &apos;s like a numbing .
kind of a distraction if you &apos;re feeling a little overwhelmed .
and so it sounds like that &apos;s one of the things that sort of feels good about it .
is there anything else about smoking that you sort of feels good for you .
okay in terms of any drawbacks have you seen any kinda negative sides to it or .
okay so for you its just main concern then is that the problem is still there .
mm .
and you said that you guys have started counseling .
okay .
okay and do you feel like that &apos;s been helping out a little bit in terms with your anxiety as well .
okay .
so the beginning stages still .
kind of like a meet greet .
mm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
and so you &apos;re meeting with a counselor to sort of come up with a plan that you and your kids &apos; dad can kind of put together .
so i guess given that you describe sort of when you smoke it really helps with your anxiety .
how do you think things would be different if your anxiety was more something that you felt like you had control over .
you would totally .
okay .
so for you at this point it &apos;s sometimes people describe it as a recreational thing .
but for you it &apos;s almost like it &apos;s medicating anxiety but if you saw yourself with less anxiety then marijuana wouldn &apos;t really be as necessary .
okay and i guess where do you see you and your family in five years &apos; time .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm well yeah it &apos;s very clear how much love and attention that you &apos;ve given to your family and how important they are good for you .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah and i think the fact that you &apos;re getting services and that you &apos;re trying to figure out as a family how to support her is huge .
i think that actually helps a lot when kids report having a situation that they &apos;ve experienced like that that can be upsetting .
mm-hmm .
mm .
yeah i can see it &apos;s a very yeah very painful difficult topic .
but and i can also see how much you guys are really trying to pull together to support her which i think is wonderful .
yeah .
and i think again unfortunetly abuse can happen but to have the love and support of family and that structure is a really huge protective thing for a lot of kids .
so and it &apos;s great that she did talk to you guys about it .
mm-hmm .
mm .
and so do you feel like the counseling that you &apos;re gonna be receiving ideally would help a little bit with the anxiety .
have you ever been on any medication for anxiety .
mm .
so the antidepressant right now is actually making it &apos;s not worth it .
yeah .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm .
and it feels like you .
and i think you had said too that in addition to the counseling you would also potentially consider talking to someone about anxiety as well .
okay .
okay .
mm .
mm-hmm .
but that isn &apos;t something that you had had sort of .
okay so it was in relation to the overdose okay .
and so i guess when people think about their drug use there &apos;s all sorts of different ways in which people can approach it so in terms of whether or not they wanna change .
for a lot of people it &apos;s like you know actually yeah i don &apos;t really see any problems with what is going on or i &apos;m pretty happy with how things are and i &apos;m just gonna kind of stick to how it &apos;s going and not really change my use .
for some people it &apos;s cutting down a little bit whatever cutting down might mean for them personally .
for some people it might be okay well i &apos;m just gonna make sure that i use in a safe way .
so maybe not drink and drive or maybe not smoke and drive .
and then for some people it might be trying to quit completely but knowing there might be a slip here and there .
and then finally for another set of people it &apos;s completely stopping that &apos;s it completely done .
so where would you say that you would fall on that right now .
okay so by cutting down it sounds like you were thinking use occasionally but not use as much .
okay .
okay and it seems like what you had said too is maybe if there were other ways that you could help deal with your anxiety then smoking weed wouldn &apos;t necessarily be something that would be as necessary all the time .
and so if you had to rate it on a one to ten scale with one being not at all and ten being extremely how confident would you be at this point to be able to start working towards that goal .
okay so higher than a two or three .
okay so what do you think it would take for you to get like a six .
okay .
mm-hmm .
so is it more just sort of kind of making up your mind to do it that &apos;s what it sounds like .
okay but once you made up your mind it sounds like you &apos;d be pretty confident that you &apos;d be able to see it through .
okay .
well would it be okay with you if i give you a call in about a week &apos;s time just to check in and say hello see if you have any questions for me see if anything kinda came up with this .
and so let me see if i can get your number .
mm-hmm .
zero two five seven .
okay and so again from our talk it sounds like you had obviously a lot going on in the past few months that have been really intense and it &apos;s kinda caused a higher level of anxiety which has sort of been part of the reason why you &apos;ve been medicating a little bit with marijuana .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
yeah it sounds like kind of almost losing parent right .
it &apos;s very difficult on top of everything else that &apos;s been going on as well .
but it also sounds like you are kind of in counseling for what happened with your daughter and then also eventually have an appointment for mental health counseling to sort of address maybe depression and anxiety .
and the goal that you sort of see yourself having is ideally maybe not having as much anxiety so then you could cut down your use a little bit so it &apos;s a little more occasional maybe once or twice a week .
okay well yeah if i can give you a call next week just to check in and see if you &apos;ve been thinking a little bit about that goal and and how you &apos;ve been doing in general so .
in the meantime .
i &apos;ll go ahead and stop this .
there we go that &apos;s on and it &apos;s recording now uh-huh .
i know it &apos;s pretty cool isn &apos;t it .
mm .
so first off my name is sandy .
and i want to thank you for participating in this study .
i know you just filled out a bunch of questions with joey and you started this earlier in this week .
so i &apos;m not sure this must have been what you filled out the other day or did you fill that out today .
okay alright and then this is he scores you based on your answers .
and so based on what you said was your drug use it put you at a moderate risk for concerns .
and this this is yours to keep .
so and i &apos;m just gonna talk to you a little bit and you can tell me a little bit about .
does this surprise you where you scored on this paper .
uh-huh uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
right right right .
tell me what &apos;s this on your shirt .
seattle international is that .
i &apos;m wondering if the n a is stands for in that or .
okay it is .
because i didn &apos;t know if it was native american .
right .
right .
wow .
well .
if it &apos;s an international convention i could imagine .
that &apos;s a lot of people though that is a lot of people .
.
so are you involved with this or .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm .
so what drugs are you using .
uh-huh .
okay .
mm .
how long ago was that .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right right .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
so how does that make you feel if you can &apos;t .
get .
really really yeah .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
and how do you want to do that .
mm mm-hmm .
you said that you used speed up until a year ago .
or six months ago or .
okay .
when was the last time you worked .
okay .
so you haven &apos;t used speed for .
for almost a year .
yeah .
yeah .
did you intentionally quit that .
or did you was that a plan quitting .
uh-huh .
and how did you plan that .
how did you make that happen .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
wow .
mm do you still do that .
no no more no more .
so you were able to just decide not to take the speed when you quit working .
if you were working would you still need the speed though .
mm-hmm .
and how do you feel about that .
okay so you agree with that statement yeah yeah .
so now we get to the .
yeah .
yeah .
but it sounds like right now there &apos;s sort of a difference that you &apos;re believing it now .
huh .
that you .
yeah yeah .
that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s good that &apos;s really positive thing for you .
mm .
mm-hmm .
yeah but now where do you live .
you live .
okay so you &apos;re .
going to meetings just in the downtown area .
do you go up to meetings up at harborview or .
yeah .
i &apos;m wondering if it &apos;s like .
you said earlier at the meetings they tell you to go to different meetings to find the right fit .
and perhaps downtown .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
oh .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm .
okay so because you have this goal to have your new business that &apos;s why you &apos;re trying to .
so .
about the marijuana tell me how that &apos;s affecting your life right now .
mm .
yeah i betcha marijuana would kinda mess with you a little bit more particularly if you .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
what do you use the marijuana for .
that &apos;s it .
mm-hmm .
.
and then what do you use the alcohol for .
yeah .
is there any .
mm .
in seattle or .
mm-hmm .
how long have you been here .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah yeah .
mm .
so what would be the advantages to giving up say the marijuana .
since it gives you the high .
okay .
mm-hmm .
have you .
cut back recently or .
okay .
at .
at the frye okay .
uh-huh .
so it sounds like you wanna kind of cut back on the marijuana use and maybe the alcohol use so that you can save some money .
and feel like a better person .
mm .
you have to .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
you didn &apos;t believe that they had stopped .
and pretend .
yeah .
because you thought they were lying yeah .
do you think they were now .
or do you think it was just .
yeah .
so what would be the advantage of going to a meeting all dressed up and .
yeah .
uh-huh .
so you like that part of the twelve steps .
mm .
is that how you would plan on cutting back on your marijuana use or .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
how would you change that .
how would you go about going every day if that .
it sounds like you would like to go every day .
have you thought about a way to do that or .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
yeah so is transportation what keeps you from going every day now .
what other things keep you from going every day now .
mm .
yeah trust me i think we all have that feeling a lot of time .
yeah i think that &apos;s a big thing .
but have you ever had ways that you &apos;ve overcome that or thought about that .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so are you smoking marijuana every day .
are you drinking every day .
okay how often are you smoking the marijuana .
oh .
mm-hmm .
so how many times a month do you think you smoke .
okay .
sounds like money is a big motivator money and yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
yeah yeah yeah .
yeah .
so what you &apos;re asking me is if you would be lying if you didn &apos;t cut back everything because you really wanna go into business for yourself .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
if it didn &apos;t work what would happen .
if your business plan for this next big one didn &apos;t work what would happen .
what would you do if that happened .
yeah .
okay good .
because sometimes it takes more than one time to work on a plan .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
right right .
out of the frye yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm yeah well it sounds like you &apos;ve pretty motivated right now to make some changes because you &apos;ve got your big goal to go into your new business and yeah clearly you &apos;re gonna save some money by quitting .
sorry .
city hall .
it &apos;s the building right kitty corner from your building i think or .
okay okay then it &apos;s the one up behind it up by .
up on .
fourth .
right right right .
so .
well so just kind of winding things up here it sounds like you &apos;ve got some plans you &apos;ve got plans to kind of take seriously your meetings and work on your goal of getting into your business you cutting back on your substance use .
and those are all really really good things .
i hope your business goes for you .
but i will also tell you that a lot of things say that there &apos;s never a failure when you &apos;re doing it it &apos;s a learning experience .
which is exactly what you kinda told me you learning at going to those meetings .
you should look at in business like that as sort of a chance to relearn .
right .
yeah .
but it &apos;s never a failure as long as you &apos;ve tried it &apos;s never a failure .
it &apos;s a learning it &apos;s a next step it &apos;s a next step .
oh i don &apos;t know somewhere .
but there &apos;s never a failure in something that you take a risk in doing it &apos;s a learning experience .
so i appreciate that i don &apos;t want you to set it up and also have to worry about the failure .
or but i hope it goes .
and i think yeah yeah .
and i think if you can get to the meetings that would be really really great for you .
so i &apos;m probably gonna give you a call in about two weeks and kinda see how you &apos;re doing .
and joey took your phone number .
do you have a phone over at the frye .
okay and here &apos;s some more .
it &apos;s not on here it &apos;s on his other paperwork .
here &apos;s some of the treatment places around there .
and harborview has a meeting up there at pat steel too on monday wednesdays and fridays .
do i go to those .
no i don &apos;t go up there because i &apos;m down here .
but on monday wednesdays and fridays and it &apos;s at noon to one o &apos;clock in the pat steel building .
do you know where that is .
did you .
where .
oh at the frye yeah .
wow wow wow .
mm .
yeah that &apos;s too bad .
no well this one is kind of up in the harborview system so .
here is a card for you .
and i thank you very much .
yeah do you .
so you take this to fred meyer or q f c and it &apos;s worth twenty five dollars .
so if you take it to fred meyer you can get other things with it other than .
yeah ham and eggs .
or if you go to fred meyer though you can buy items .
yeah so basically part of our study is looking at drug use behavior for the next year basically .
so i &apos;m here to talk to you about what that has looked like for you in the past and how you want it to look .
my goal is not to get you to change or to go to treatment or anything like that .
we &apos;re actually just interested in hearing your perspective on it and what you think what you &apos;ve been doing stuff like that .
so yeah i guess it sounds like you &apos;re using .
the what .
yeah .
that &apos;s exactly what i was gonna say .
no so it sounds like marijuana and some cocaine but not recently .
yeah so what do you want to talk about with regards to marijuana and your use and .
no .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
there you go .
yeah so for you it &apos;s kind of like something you &apos;ve done for a really long time it &apos;s not really a problem .
uh-huh .
yeah .
so why do you use .
or how did that .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
okay .
uh-huh .
so .
oh .
so for you pot kind of came in almost instead of alcohol or .
oh okay .
uh-huh .
yeah so for you it seems like the most important thing is kind of this feeling good and actually getting something out of it and it sounds like alcohol was not doing that for you .
so this is almost i mean if i have you right this is almost part of your leaving alcohol is to .
smoke a joint .
so this is part of your .
mm-hmm .
so this is in your mind a lot better then .
oh gees .
oh shoot .
yeah i imagine that &apos;s a little scary .
yeah .
yeah so right now marijuana i mean it sounds like it was really fun but you &apos;re wondering how long you &apos;re gonna be able to do it .
yeah .
could be anything could be anything .
yeah .
yeah so it sounds like you &apos;re a little bit concerned about that but you don &apos;t want to jump to conclusions .
yeah yeah well you don &apos;t know right now .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
so that five percent it sounds like that &apos;s the part that you &apos;re thinking you can have some control over yeah .
right so for you you &apos;re the kind of guy that if something comes up as a problem you take action immediately .
.
yeah .
so for smoking is that what happened for you .
did it get to a point where you were like you don &apos;t want to do this anymore this is a problem .
okay .
oh like a vaporizer .
oh .
okay .
yeah .
so you &apos;ve learned some lessons that &apos;s basically what you &apos;re saying too is that if this time something were to come up you &apos;d stop yeah .
because it kind of it hurt .
uh-huh so that euphoric feeling kind of was outweighed by the pain it sounds like yeah .
so you &apos;re just looking for something to have enjoyment with or that doesn &apos;t hurt .
.
ahh shoot .
well so you &apos;re looking to have fun it sounds like .
uh-huh .
okay .
so work is really important to you and getting back the and it sounds like breathing right and having this resolved is one step towards that .
oh yeah so i was kind of surprised when you were just talking and you said you don &apos;t smoke pot anymore .
so is that kind of what this has all come to today this visit and the hearing about your lungs .
is that kinda the decision you made .
gees .
it sounds like you really care about your body and your future .
yeah .
yeah .
coughing .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
no one is gonna slow you down now .
.
yeah so what do you want your life to look like in these next five years .
uh huh .
oh wow .
yeah that sounds nice .
so you &apos;re really motivated to kind of focus on your health right now this is a big deal for you .
right .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm wow you don &apos;t really have access to the kind of foods you need to stay healthy .
oh .
wow .
.
so you &apos;re kind of struggling to get your health on track here given what resources you have available .
yeah .
oh .
so they &apos;re really helping you .
yeah .
they care about you .
so it sounds like with the smoking then and kind of marijuana that for you is kind of an easy decision because say &apos; no i can &apos;t do this anymore &apos; but some of this other stuff is a little more difficult .
uh-huh .
that &apos;s impressive i mean most people don &apos;t say that so .
oh wow .
mm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
uh-huh .
ugh .
yeah .
yeah .
right .
oh okay .
a little bit .
yeah .
so you were just like &apos; i don &apos;t need this i &apos;m done with this &apos; and you &apos;re kind of returning to your health .
and then for smoking is it the same process for you .
i mean smoking marijuana you &apos;re kind of at this point where you &apos;re like what .
yeah .
yeah .
so pain is kind of outweighing a lot of this .
gee .
ugh sounds unbearable .
definitely .
there you go .
yeah well it sounds like you &apos;re thinking of other ways that you can still have fun but having it not damage your health .
and especially your lungs it sounds like are the part that &apos;s very painful smoking no mater what it is it sounds like it hurts .
ugh .
oh so you wanna save your lungs .
that &apos;s pretty profound .
hmm a lot of big decisions right now .
well that &apos;s basically it .
i mean i just wanna share that i feel pretty privileged to be hearing you talk about this because it seems like you &apos;ve been going through a lot in your life and to say that you care about your life and you want to save your life and that that &apos;s what you &apos;re working towards is something that not everyone says and does .
it seems like you still have a fight in you and you have a lot to look forward to and you .
that &apos;s right .
there you go .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
ooh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
oh wow .
oh gees .
it went really fast .
oh gosh .
huh .
wow that &apos;s a long wait .
yeah .
yeah you have .
yeah well and it sounds like you have a plan right now you said to me that you &apos;re using thirty percent of your lungs you wanna get better you have a lot to look forward to and since smoking hurts you &apos;re not interested in doing it anymore .
and it sounds like you &apos;re also looking for other ways that you could have fun whether that &apos;s through brownies or drugs or is one way that &apos;s not it sounds like you &apos;re considering that won &apos;t hurt your lungs .
and also it sounds like you have lots of plans for the future and things to do .
you &apos;re on the road .
is there anything else that i can do to help you with your next steps or that we could refer you to here .
.
okay .
okay .
yeah .
well .
yeah .
yeah well i &apos;m gonna be calling you back just to check in about kind of how things are going probably in a couple of weeks like three weeks from now .
and then also on the day that you come to get your c a t scan too you can let the social workers know or i can do that as well and just that &apos; hey there might be some intense results maybe not maybe everything is fine &apos; .
but there are people here that would definitely wanna be with you if that was the case so .
don &apos;t i mean you again have been doing everything it sounds like to care for your health .
and we want to support you in that .
so that &apos;s it .
and again i really appreciate your honesty and just talking and it &apos;s great to hear about your life and kinda where it &apos;s going .
and it seems hopeful to me even though there &apos;s some scary parts but .
so let &apos;s see you get i think you get all of these which is pretty cool i &apos;ve never given someone so many gift cards i don &apos;t know why that is .
but here you go that &apos;s for talking to me and i don &apos;t think i give you oh i &apos;m not sure how much those are for but .
nice okay cool so you get those for your trouble .
and then this is also i &apos;m not sure if you &apos;re interested in this but this is just some numbers of people that you could talk to .
i &apos;m trying to look and see if there &apos;s anyone well you can take this if you want it it &apos;s just resources if you don &apos;t want it that &apos;s okay too .
if i don &apos;t i will this is someone else &apos;s .
let me give you .
okay perfect oh perfect okay .
so my name is grin and then this is my office line here at harborview .
and i &apos;ll be giving you a call .
and your contact number is on here i think they gave it to me too or you gave it to them there you go okay .
i &apos;ll turn the .
so i &apos;m just going to put this right here like this .
and my name is matt and i &apos;m a social worker in the clinic .
can you tell me your name .
i didn &apos;t get that .
c h a y a .
k o s .
okay .
all right .
won &apos;t do that .
so chloe explained to you a little bit about what &apos;s gonna happen next .
okay so what we &apos;d like to do is sort of is continue the conversation with you about some of the things that you &apos;d answered on the many different questionnaires that you did with her .
if it &apos;s okay with you i &apos;d like to ask you to just maybe talk with me a little bit about your current drug use and how that &apos;s going for you .
or how it works or doesn &apos;t work .
yeah so that &apos;s it .
if you just wanna kinda let me know .
all right what &apos;s your drug of choice .
so it was eight years ago .
and you &apos;re still in a lot of pain .
and you have been for eight years all right .
and your doctor &apos;s prescribing you painkillers .
okay .
yeah tell me how you &apos;re able to get a hold of them .
okay .
all right are there other drugs that you use .
so really it &apos;s only alcohol and painkillers .
uh-huh .
oh .
okay .
so you &apos;re pretty clear about your limits on alcohol use .
and it sounds like you drink alcohol on occasion to socialize and it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
talk a little bit more about the painkillers .
it sounds like you feel like you &apos;re not getting adequate pain .
mm-hmm .
okay .
oh what helps about it .
mm-hmm .
okay so you &apos;ve tried other things and you currently are working on doing it sounds like a variety of things to try to help ease some of this pain chronic pain that you &apos;re in and it &apos;s effective sometimes not all the time .
the stuff that you &apos;re working with through the pain clinic .
okay .
okay and as far as you &apos;re concerned or what you would like is to have more relief of your pain and you would like to get narcotics to help with that .
okay .
and narcotics have been the only thing that other than this brief periods of relief the narcotics have only been the things to work .
okay .
right .
so you &apos;re not it &apos;s not that you &apos;re wanting narcotics in particular it &apos;s just that &apos;s what &apos;s really worked .
okay can you describe that a little bit more about how it works .
or how is it more effective than anything else .
okay .
wow .
that sounds like a lot of pain .
uh-huh .
tell me about how the narcotics work in what ways do they work .
yeah .
sounds like you &apos;ve had many years of being in pain without much relief .
about ten years or so .
hmm .
yeah pretty serious accident .
wow so you &apos;re pretty fortunate to have survived .
oh yeah so the misfortune was that now you have to live with this chronic pain .
so you said that using narcotics helps you sleep better it sounds like you use it for breakthrough pain .
what else what else is what else makes it better .
yeah .
but what else how else is are the narcotics better than anything else .
okay .
and you &apos;re gonna get them i think as you said legally or illegally just because that &apos;s what &apos;s effective .
so tell me a little bit about what are some perhaps negative or some risks associated with narcotics .
we already talked about one being illegal it could potentially it &apos;s illegal .
right .
mm-hmm .
yeah to give somebody else your prescription .
yeah .
wow .
are you concerned at all about any aspects of taking painkillers .
does that concern you at all .
okay you don &apos;t take them that much .
but is that because you that &apos;s all you can get .
all right so you would take them more if you had them .
yeah .
so let &apos;s hypothetically say if you had them if you had unlimited access can you think of anything that you would be then concerned about in terms of taking those .
so you would what are some risks that you know of that would that you &apos;re thinking of that would motivate you to take them as prescribed .
so though you are aware of the potential for addiction as a concern .
okay .
so you &apos;re pretty comfortable with knowing that you would be able to manage taking painkillers as they &apos;re prescribed then addiction wouldn &apos;t be an issue for you okay all right .
do you have any other things that you &apos;re kinda concerned about in terms of drug use .
oh .
it sounds like your main concern is that you &apos;re not getting adequate narcotics to help ease your pain .
yeah tell me how that discussion has gone with your doctor .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so your pain doctor is actually recommending that you get more pain medication .
yeah okay but your primary care doctor &apos;s has refused to prescribe that for anybody .
all right .
yeah .
what do you .
where do you think everyone &apos;s reluctance to prescribe this kind of medication comes from .
yeah what do you think she &apos;s concerned about .
using it responsibly .
yeah all right .
mm-hmm .
so just to review a little bit you &apos;re trying different types of treatments to reduce your pain some of which are effective some are not but really the most effective has been the painkillers helps .
so the chiropractor has been even more effective than the painkillers .
so why is that not available to you .
okay .
it &apos;s not covered through your insurance .
i wonder if your doctor was able to prescribe it or something .
certainly i bet that if she knew that that was even more effective than pain medication that would be more interesting to her probably yeah .
right .
yup so just in terms of talking about the pain medication then it does help you sleep better helps with breakthrough pain it &apos;s been more effective than anything that you have available to you right now at the other hand it &apos;s illegal and so you &apos;re taking a legal risk by taking other people &apos;s medication .
and you &apos;re aware that there &apos;s potential for addiction but you &apos;re really not worried about that .
okay and it &apos;s just your doctor &apos;s been reluctant to prescribe them so that &apos;s been a problem .
okay so what do you think what do you think you might do considering all of those things .
kinda keep going doing .
all right part of this conversation we had is to show you a score that you got on what &apos;s called a drug abuse screening test .
and that was part of the questionnaires that you did .
and what i &apos;d like to do is ask you this drug abuse screening test is scaled from zero to ten with zero being no risk and ten being severe risk .
and in the middle there is some risk and moderate risk .
and i just wondered what you thought how much does your drug use your current drug use how much risk does it expose you to .
and by risk .
not much .
would you say no risk some risk moderate risk or severe risk .
okay well it turns out that the way you &apos;ve scored that there &apos;s some risk as well .
which doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s no risk it means there is some risk .
and we talked about what those risks might be .
i didn &apos;t do this this is what chloe gave to me .
yeah and we talked about those risks being legal and some of those risks being addiction .
okay .
so you &apos;re doing some things to reduce that risk .
okay .
all right well do you have any questions about anything that we talked about .
i appreciate you taking the time to do this .
i know it sounds like you have your this is clearly something that &apos;s important for you you &apos;ve been dealing with it for a long time you &apos;ve explored some different options that have been effective .
and it sounds like you &apos;re gonna continue to do that but also continue to do what you need to do then to relieve your pain .
yeah all right so i don &apos;t really have anything else to .
i appreciate you talking to me .
and this is for you .
and i need to actually we have one more part that we need to do together and i would like to call you in about a week just to kind of review some of the things we talked about if that &apos;s all right .
what &apos;s a phone number where i can call you on .
zero six seven zero .
and is it okay if i leave a voicemail on there .
okay .
was that your cell phone .
oh okay .
all right thank you very much .
okay so this is the only session that you &apos;ll really have with me i &apos;m probably gonna give you a call back but .
it &apos;s this is our little recorder .
i think jessica took all that information from you .
mm-hmm .
okay so one of the she had you fill out this questionnaire and then we had a further question .
and then she completed a risk assessment it says how much harm is your drug use expose you to .
and based on your answers she scored you .
does that surprise you .
do you see where you scored .
okay .
okay do you wanna tell me .
right .
ahh .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
and my counselor at sound mental health is on top of it he knows what i &apos;m going through and might even put me in detox .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm-hmm .
alright .
yeah .
so when did you last take some benzos .
okay .
alright .
so .
so does this help the methadone last longer for you or .
after the methadone is kicked in .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
if i can &apos;t within i made a promise to my counselor if i can &apos;t get rid of the benzos and the beer in a month i will go to detox and then after that possibly treatment .
okay so how much beer do you take in the morning .
so one twenty four ounce can .
and then you go get your methadone .
oh the methadone comes first .
okay .
uh-huh .
okay so it &apos;s kind of a cocktail in .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay .
so .
let &apos;s talk some more about the drug and alcohol and your methadone .
so how long have you been on the methadone .
mm-hmm .
good .
uh-huh .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
okay so i wanna talk a little bit more .
i apologize for stopping you .
what i really wanna try and keep us focused on a little bit here is more what &apos;s going on when you take your methadone .
so it sounds like from what you &apos;ve just told me that you started methadone in two thousand .
when did you add the benzos .
.
uh-huh okay so after four and a half years you just all of a sudden started using the benzos .
okay .
tell me .
about that .
mm-hmm .
mm had you had some sort of benzos before in part of your treatment .
okay .
okay .
alright alright so are there any .
you told me that when you talk with your case manager that you talked a little bit about wanting to get off of the benzos .
just the alcohol .
alright and have they talked .
so if you were to go to detox that &apos;s just a detox off your alcohol .
so you &apos;re not .
uh-huh .
okay but i &apos;m kinda hearing from you that you really don &apos;t wanna detox off the benzos as .
much as .
you do .
oh .
okay .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so it sounds like you &apos;re very motivated right now to get off of all of this .
okay .
and so as soon as you get into the apartment this is what you &apos;re going to do .
okay and if you &apos;re not able to curl up on the couch and do it yourself .
okay well that sounds like a good plan .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
and how will you do that .
okay and do you get any benzos from your psychiatrist at some point .
so you just are getting it through .
okay .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm so you don &apos;t see any .
when is this apartment coming in the .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm when you had your apartments before did you use drugs .
never .
okay .
mm-hmm .
but it sounds like for a while you used heroin or .
prior to .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
and you were using heroin when you got hired then .
okay .
when did you first start using heroin .
okay so you were working and then and that was the very first time .
how old were you .
oh .
okay .
yeah .
uh-huh .
do you have any concerns that getting into your apartment that this might not all work for you think about it .
because of your .
it sounds like you &apos;ve been in treatment in the past and then got using and .
yeah .
okay .
okay .
well that &apos;s good that &apos;s good .
i really think that having that support and having that sound mental health and i hope having that apartment i .

well that &apos;s good .
my counselor &apos;s very happy that i &apos;m very focused .
okay .
good .
yeah .
right .
well it sounds like things are gonna go pretty good for you and that you &apos;re pretty hopeful about .
that .
good .
that &apos;s good .
yeah .
good .
mm-hmm .
well it sounds like you &apos;ve got a plan it sounds like you &apos;ve got some supports and it sounds like you &apos;ve really thought about if it doesn &apos;t work with you doing it what your backup plan .
is so .
yeah .
yeah well michael thank you for coming in and talking with us .

and then she &apos;s .
then there will be research assistants who will be following up with you later .
thank you very much for talking with us .
those coupons are good at fred meyer and q f c .
actually i didn &apos;t ever notice that before but they &apos;re on the back of the card are all those places .
alright there we go .
so is it wendell or wendell .
wendell okay .
i went to school with a guy named wendell .
so thanks for coming back .
i know that it &apos;s kind of a hassle sometimes .
and for answering all those questions you did yesterday .
we appreciate you participating in the study .
one of the forms or one of the questionnaires that you have completed was what they call a drug assessment screening test that kind of assesses your risk of your use .
and i was wondering if you were interested in kind of the outcome of that .
the results of that screening test .
uh-huh it rates you on your risk from zero to ten with zero being no risk and ten being really high risk .
where do you think you might have placed .
you don &apos;t know .
you rated a four .
well according to their assessment that would be moderate risk .
so you &apos;re not at the top but you &apos;re not down at the bottom either so there &apos;s some moderate risk from your use .
what do you make of that .
mm-hmm .
right .
well forget the test .
tell me what you think about your drug use .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
what &apos;s the difference for you .
what makes you decide to stop using for a while .
mm .
so tell me about it .
what &apos;s it like when you get tired of being high .
mm-hmm .
oh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
so sometimes you just get kinda tired of it all the hustles you say the hassle maybe of it .
mm-hmm .
mm .
oh .
so it sounds like there &apos;s times that you realize you don &apos;t like doing it and you how you feel about yourself when you &apos;re doing it wow .
mm-hmm so you &apos;ve really been able to kinda look inside it and say i don &apos;t like who i am and what i &apos;m doing and i &apos;m gonna stop this and stop .
wow .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
mm-hmm .
.
and are you able to do that .
really .
just to stop .
wow .
mm-hmm .
mm .
you know wendell i &apos;m amazed that you &apos;re able to just wake up today and say okay i &apos;m done i &apos;m done for a while .
how do you do that .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
oh .
mm-hmm .
.
mm-hmm .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
kinda with all kinds of stuff .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
sure well wendell it sounds like you &apos;ve had the experience of friends and other people that you know .
and some of the people that i &apos;ve worked with know that it &apos;s hard to just stop without a process or a difficulty or slips and going back and forth and back and forth .
and what you &apos;re telling me is you &apos;re able to just stop cold turkey .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so what are you using now primarily .
cocaine .
mm-hmm .
so how much are you using cocaine .
do you .
mm and so it sounds like you said you &apos;re getting to the end of another run .
mm .
so i &apos;m just fascinated .
and was wondering if you can tell me how do you .
i mean because as you said cocaine is a .
it &apos;s a .
mind-altering chemical it &apos;s a hard drug .
people get hooked because it feels good and they want that feeling again and again and again .
and you &apos;re saying i want that but boom i can shut the door .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
so tell me what it is that stops being fun about it .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm .
least that &apos;s how you see it right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
but it sounds like you &apos;re able to stop without dwelling on the good things that you liked about it .
which can lead people to slip back and try it again .
ahh .
mm-hmm .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
.
yeah so even you &apos;re recognizing that those thoughts are not kinda crazy .
mm-hmm .
wow .
so you said earlier that you went from ninety two to ninety eight or ninety six whatever it was clean and then woke up one day and kinda thought back when you got high .
oh .
what do you think was the .
mm-hmm .
hmm .
wow .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so you knew that was coming up .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so what do .
you get from it .
using .
.
different how .
do you like that .
mm-hmm .
right .
but there &apos;s something .
right .
sure .
but there &apos;s something that you &apos;re looking for it sounds like because you said i get to act out in a way that i don &apos;t normally .
what do you want to do .
mm-hmm .
right .
so i wanna make sure i understand because i understand all that but i feel like i &apos;m missing a piece in getting you .
so i understand that the drug changes your brain and how you see things and you get paranoid and see things that aren &apos;t there sometimes and that stuff i get .
but you &apos;re saying it &apos;s almost like i wanna be able to act differently than i do in my normal life .
and i &apos;m wondering what is it you &apos;re trying to what do you to act different .
that &apos;s the piece i &apos;m trying to understand .
what do you want to be .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so what do you .
yeah i know .
you don &apos;t need to be .
you &apos;re talking about you and your experience .
mm-hmm .
right .
yeah .
go .
.
what i hear is this real mix for you kinda like you &apos;re pulled in two different directions there &apos;s this part of you that doesn &apos;t like the hassle and the hustle and doesn &apos;t like the paranoia and the weird feelings and things that go on .
well but on the other hand there &apos;s a part of you that feels like it sounds like you need to kinda get out of your normal quote-unquote mode you wanna feel i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s freer or more excited or something that you &apos;re wanting that &apos;s different than your normal life and yet you don &apos;t like it when you get there and so you &apos;re kind of between a rock and a hard place sometimes .
there &apos;s a part of you that wants the normal life and the other part of you is wanting to be able to be different and how you i &apos;m not quite sure what the different is that you &apos;re wanting but how you &apos;ve gotten that is through the cocaine .
and i &apos;m just wondering have you ever thought about being able to be whatever that different is freer more without the cocaine .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
.
yeah .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so other than this different feeling that we had a little trouble pinning down what else do you get out of getting high .
what else are the benefits what are the good things for you of getting high .
mm .
hmm .
why do you need to get away from .
you .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
so you have a real sense of responsibility and self care .
do you ever feel like you can get away from people without getting high .
mm-hmm .
.
uh-huh you &apos;ve got a lot of experience .
so i &apos;m kinda fascinated .
you said you &apos;d never really thought about kinda what are the good things and the bad things .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
so wendell what i &apos;m hearing is i work hard to get my money and then to turn around and just blow it on blow doesn &apos;t make sense i don &apos;t like the paranoia that comes with it i don &apos;t like that kinda sense i don &apos;t wanna be around people i don &apos;t see any in your own words you said i don &apos;t see any benefits of using .
yeah .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
sure .
sure .
.
yeah .
oh mellowing out a little today .
mellowing out a little today .
okay .
mm-hmm .
right .
sure .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
okay .
so i don &apos;t care about labels .
you described yourself as a functioning addict .
what do you what &apos;s your plan .
you talked about you think you &apos;re kind of heading toward a clean and sober phase .
do you have a plan about when that &apos;s gonna happen or how that &apos;s gonna happen .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
can &apos;t do that .
okay so that &apos;s a real .
mm-hmm .
but it &apos;s also a real vision and goal that you have to work for if i want to be there for those people and help them out and do .
mm-hmm .
oh .
so you don &apos;t like that they .
right .
mm-hmm .
what &apos;s that like for you admit to them that you &apos;ve been .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
sure .
right .
mm-hmm .
ahh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
.
mm .
right .
hmm .
right .
sure .
sure .
mm-hmm .
tired of it mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
ahh .
sure sure .
everything .
well what we &apos;ll do is give you a call next week just to touch base that won &apos;t be a long thing but just to kind of i think .
make sure i &apos;ve got it .
three eight seven .
ninety three .
okay but just kinda touch base to see how you &apos;re doing after our conversation today .
and it sounds like one of the things maybe is to follow up on the thought about are there any good things about getting high .
right .
okay and maybe also the plan if you &apos;ve kinda firmed up maybe your plan about when you &apos;re gonna quit .
so as i said this is a one time deal so you won &apos;t see me anymore you will do the assessments again in another six months .
six months uh-huh .
but i will call you next week just to touch base .
i &apos;m a social worker .
mm-hmm .
yeah so the other thing is we do have a list of treatment programs if you &apos;re interested .
from what you said before i didn &apos;t think so .
do you want your score .
okay .
here &apos;s your gift card .
at q f c or fred meyer .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
not that i know of no .
i .
yeah i think i &apos;d just take it to the store and they &apos;ll do whatever they need .
but i think they &apos;ll scan that and it should deduct this as you need to but that &apos;s twenty five .
.
did they .
i don &apos;t have any .
i can call up and see if they have any .
oh okay well let &apos;s go back .
okay yeah we &apos;re recording now .
so how has this been for you so far .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm so you &apos;re kinda looking at yourself trying to get some help .
okay .
mm-hmm .
you &apos;re trying to say you feel like maybe you &apos;re not addicted it &apos;s the circumstances and stuff like .
okay .
do the same things over and over .
yeah .
if you could change those patterns something like that okay .
okay .
well like megan said i &apos;m alex and this part of the interview is a little bit different .
because i know she &apos;s been asking a lot of questions like you said .
and here we just kinda wanna give you a chance to talk a little bit more about drug use and i &apos;ll kinda just be following along with you .
and it sounds like you &apos;ve been thinking about change .
that &apos;s definitely not and that topic might come up but this isn &apos;t really a situation where i &apos;m trying to force you change one way or another or anything like .
that i &apos;m really just trying to hear your ideas about kinda what you want to happen with your drug use and stuff like that .
because some people come in they don &apos;t wanna change anything some people come in they wanna do complete one eighty .
so that &apos;s up to you you &apos;re in the driver &apos;s seat .
okay and it usually takes about fifteen to twenty five minutes and let &apos;s see there &apos;s anything else that we should mention .
they also give us this sheet here to share with you and this is based on some of the answers that you gave us .
and this is risk factors based on drug use and you scored an eight which is up here in the severe risk .
mm-hmm can you tell me about that .
what &apos;s severe about it .
mm-hmm .
okay yeah .
so .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so it seems like now that you &apos;re getting older there &apos;s a connection between drug use and your health .
and we &apos;re talking mostly cocaine right .
okay so you see a connection between the two .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
maybe the scene where you go .
.
yeah .
yeah .
it sounds like there &apos;s something about what you &apos;re thinking about where it &apos;s definitely there &apos;s a better place than where you &apos;re yeah .
can you tell me more about kinda that pattern or how it fits into your everyday life like .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
so based on some of your doing some of the old behaviors now you kinda see that maybe spiraling out of control .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
this ain &apos;t your first rodeo .
ahh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so it sounds like there could be severe consequences based just on using cocaine okay .
so you mentioned that there were patterns of behavior things that you do over and over again .
mm-hmm .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
kind of caught yourself doing that it sounds like you said kinda like ahh yeah i could see myself doing that .
uh-huh .
i see so you find yourself throughout the day .
is this every day or most days .
not every day .
a couple days a week or .
okay .
yeah .
yeah .
definitely yeah and it sounds like there &apos;s maybe a sense of pride about getting this stuff together and trying to seek help for you .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
so it sounds like you have a strong awareness of what you &apos;re doing where you need to be and what you need to do to do that and you &apos;re already getting some of that in place but you &apos;re still finding yourself doing some of these behaviors .
some old thoughts even .
okay so some of it &apos;s the old behaviors like hanging around people who are using when you know that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing but then there &apos;s also some thoughts that keep this going as well .
mm-hmm yeah i &apos;m curious about what maybe some of those thoughts are if you &apos;re okay with sharing them .
sound like you said some of those old thoughts keep you .
going .
mm .
uh-huh .
so it &apos;s not working for you .
no .
so it &apos;s costing you more money than you .
should be .
okay .
hmm .
right it sounds like it &apos;s hard to get by .
.
uh-huh yeah .
yeah it &apos;s almost like you notice that you &apos;re coming up short and you &apos;re thinking there &apos;s a red flag there .
they &apos;re popping up .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah and you also said that it seemed like there was some relationship between using and your health .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
well it sounds like it &apos;s just been a real stressful trip for you .
mm-hmm .
and there &apos;s something about if cocaine was out of the picture or scaled back that this would be a little bit .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm so some of that might be just making a connection with all those people also who use drugs that &apos;s kind of become a strong association between seeking out people but people who use drugs yeah .
so what do you there must be something about it that does do something for you .
mm-hmm sure well it sounds like you could use the comfort i mean it sounds like you could use some comfort i don &apos;t say that comfort but some comfort .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
i wonder what &apos;s comfortable about it what .
so so there &apos;s some sort of sharing of experience with these people then .
is it .
oh go ahead i &apos;m sorry .
mm-hmm .
so even though it &apos;s a group that uses cocaine and stuff like that there &apos;s something that &apos;s still .
it &apos;s like a understanding or you guys go through some of the same things or very .
yeah yeah .
you &apos;ve got some shared experiences and it sounds like they &apos;re pretty accepting of the things that you need to do .
mm-hmm .
yeah yeah so yeah there is something positive about this group of people that &apos;s there &apos;s something that you &apos;re getting out of hanging out with them but then you &apos;re also using drugs with them that sounds like yeah .
mm .
yeah it &apos;s been a rough ride for you up and down huh .
yeah .
mm-hmm so it sounds like i mean you told me there was a lot of kind of like negative things you &apos;re seeing connection between your use and your health the money and it was almost just like there &apos;s something about using that &apos;s just not where you wanna be at .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
tasteless .
mm-hmm .
so then on the other side the positives is you get to hang around these people you kinda get a social support that way as well .
mm-hmm .
.
that you could make some money .
or they .
.
you can .
through selling .
mm .
as soon as you get some you spend it .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
okay .
so something about earning money that way that doesn &apos;t sit well with you as well .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
and it sounds like lately you find yourself more scraping by than you &apos;d like to be .
yeah .
yeah so and then the positive side was the relationships .
was there anything else positive about it that .
no it &apos;s just hanging around with the friends .
and then what happens when you &apos;re with these people how does it turn into using .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
and what was that .
what was the .
same .
mm .
go to prison or get sick .
so it &apos;s always some pretty bad consequences .
yeah .
yeah and it sounds like there &apos;s been periods of time where you &apos;ve been clean and you &apos;ve seen the other side of the coin .
okay .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah so if you spend the money on the dope like you said that ends up being kinda meaningless whereas you could be treating yourself .
yeah .
yeah .
you &apos;ve been wanting those .
.
yeah .
yeah .
and so the periods in your life that you &apos;ve been clean you &apos;ve noticed that that &apos;s kind of what the experience has been like it &apos;s pretty .
mm-hmm .
yeah i even see you bubble up a little bit when you talk about it .
yeah so that &apos;s a better time for you it sounds like .
yeah and so you said you were taking some next steps to get there and you said that you were .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay .
and that &apos;s .
a voluntary outpatient .
you look like you &apos;re ready for that it looks like you &apos;re anticipating it .
and what are your goals for that program .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
yeah so is there some things that you would like to be productive with .
mm-hmm .
.
mm .
mm-hmm .
yeah yeah and so is this outpatient program is it a drug treatment program .
yeah okay okay it &apos;s a .
.
it &apos;s the top of the chart .
so where would you like to be on that .
at no risk so you &apos;d wanna be down there .
so your goals for using and so i saw on this sheet that you wrote that you wanna quit using once and for all .
and so there &apos;s a lot of different things that you could do one is definitely to quit once and for all .
one is to not do anything .
another thing you could do is it sounds like you &apos;re already doing is seeking some support through outpatient .
some people choose to just use in a controlled manner .
.
uh-huh .
.
that &apos;s .
you &apos;ve been there yeah .
that &apos;s just not how it works for you .
you haven &apos;t seen it work that way so for you it &apos;s important just to quit .
altogether huh .
mm-hmm .
yeah so you &apos;d wanna do that quit the b s which was the money problems the health problems there &apos;s wasting your time kinda like stuff like that kinda feeling bad about what you &apos;re doing quit all that stuff come over to the other side and get through your program .
treat yourself .
and it sounded like there were things you wanted to be more productive about whether it &apos;s i don &apos;t know if you meant being engaged in your treatment more or you mean hanging out with different people .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
oh there you go .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm so using kinda keeps you from .
doing those things that you like to do .
yeah .
ahh mm-hmm .
yeah done that you &apos;ve been fighting that battle for a while and it now it sounds like you &apos;re pretty serious about changing it in .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
yeah .
so what &apos;s your next step from today then to get this rolling .
i mean it sounds like that program is part of it .
is there anything else that you &apos;re doing after today to .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
sure .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
right .
so would your goal then to .
i know your goal is to quit using altogether .
is that to be totally abstinent after your program or are there steps that you &apos;re gonna take now to get there .
or what &apos;s the .
you said it just fine then .
so i guess yeah what i mean is will that be after your program .
will it be before the program is finished .
what &apos;s your .
beforehand oh okay okay .
before yeah yeah .
yeah and so i &apos;m curious about what are some of the other things that might be happening along the way that that &apos;s gonna help .
there .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
so it sounds like you .
sounds like you &apos;ve got some plans about how to do that already .
mm-hmm so being aware of those people places and things and .
uh-huh .
yeah .
so you must have some alternative ideas or some alternative activities or something for when you start thinking about those things you &apos;re gonna do these instead .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
sure .
yeah yeah it sounds like it &apos;ll be yeah so you &apos;re already fighting some of that battle and the rest of it is gonna be a battle but it sounds like it &apos;s one worth fighting .
yeah .
mm-hmm excellent okay well great well it &apos;s been really great talking to you .
and i just wanna make sure that i i mean i think i &apos;m hearing you loud and clear about what &apos;s been kind of in your way has been using with these friends .
.
and they &apos;re not your friends .
it &apos;s kind of falling into those comforts but there &apos;s some other comforts on the other side you &apos;re calling that comforts on this side but at the same time you end up kind of scraping by more you end up getting sick more often not feeling real good about yourself .
and so .
okay .
it &apos;s .
mm .
i see .
right .
right .
mm-hmm .
yeah they &apos;re on to you and you don &apos;t really wanna have that going on you wanna be open and honest with them .
mm-hmm and so that would be over here you &apos;d be healthy have more money you could treat yourself you could get into some of these things you &apos;ve been thinking about like getting back on your bike and riding the bus around and all that stuff .
and it sounds like the way you wanna do that is to start this program but also while you &apos;re doing the program being aware of people places and things and trying to find alternatives for those kinds of things .
so great yeah it &apos;s been really wonderful talking to you .
i &apos;m wondering if it &apos;s okay if i call you in about a week just to kinda check in and see how you &apos;re doing .
yes we &apos;ll have your number .
that you gave megan the number .
okay so it &apos;ll be in the database .
and was there anything else that you wanna ask me or .
.
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
.
uh-huh .
oh okay yeah .
so you felt happy to get in to .
okay well good i &apos;m glad to hear that .
definitely it was a pleasure on my end too .
and we have this list i don &apos;t know if you want this or not because you already have a treatment but it &apos;s just substance abuse treatment resources .
okay .
.
yeah .
yeah exactly can &apos;t have too much support i guess .
and then this is the gift card that you talked about for the you can use it at the kroger stores .
it would be q f c i think there &apos;s a list of them .
the back .
oh is it in the .
oh it &apos;s in the front yeah .
fred meyer .
yeah so .
.
yeah .
that &apos;s a good slice of history .
and then did you wanna keep this as well .
okay .
.
.
that &apos;s sounding really good right now yeah definitely .
.
alright well it &apos;s been a pleasure .
.
.
you have another appointment today .
okay thank you for putting up with all that .
so i wanna thank you first of all for participating in this study .
and we can .
do you have a lot of questions about what was being asked or .
all right well what she does is when she if it &apos;s okay i &apos;ll kind of explain .
she asks you probably spent quite a few minutes there answering all these questions .
and then she can rate it on what they call the dast pyramid score .
and so they kind of have this figured out where how you score is where they see you on this pyramid .
does that surprise you .
i see you scored a three .
really .
yeah .
yeah .
you just smoke the weed yeah .
uh-huh .
okay .
.
yeah .
yeah yeah so the benefit for you of smoking the weed is for the pain relief .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
okay so right now you &apos;re not getting your pain medications .
okay .
yeah yeah and when you &apos;re on the percocets and the vicodin .
it sounds like you &apos;ve got arthritis .
okay when you &apos;re on that medication do you smoke weed at all .
okay .
mm mm .
so if you were to stop it like because it sounds like this is pretty interesting this it sounds like you &apos;re really surprised by this information .
uh-huh if you were to stop how would you what would you see as .
do you see any problems with not doing it .
even if you didn &apos;t get your vicodin and that would there be more of an issue then .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
yeah .
yeah yeah .
mm-hmm to buy .
the pot .
to buy it yeah yeah yeah .
do you what would be the difficulties of that .
are there any difficulties in stopping the smoking for you .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
is that a good thing or a bad thing .
okay .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
yeah .

wow wow wow that &apos;s pretty impressive .
yeah yeah so it &apos;s a good thing then to see if your to cut back for you and well even though the money isn &apos;t an issue between you as a really couple it sounds like it would be nice to have more money .
buy a tank of gas .
yeah yeah and then the other benefit would be that it sounds like he would appreciate it too and that sounds like that your relationship &apos;s really important to you .
yeah .
yeah yeah .
mm-hmm .
right right .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
but .
yeah .
and you have the pain meds right now .
on a scale of one to ten where do you think you are as far as being able to quit .
nine and a half .
okay tell me about the half that &apos;s not there .
mm-hmm .
okay .
me too .
yeah .
yeah .
okay .
so you know you &apos;re gonna you know there &apos;s gonna be the desire .

mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .

mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
wow wow that &apos;s pretty impressive .
what happened to make you decide to leave town that time that .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
right .
right .
so you &apos;d mentioned the benefit to you is what was the big motivation for drinking .
what is the benefit to you for stopping the pot .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm so those are two of the big gains .
okay all right well it does sound like you &apos;ve got your supports in place and it also sounds like you &apos;ve come up with some reasons that it might be a benefit for you .
yeah yeah so that &apos;s all i need to do probably i &apos;ll try and be in touch with you or charlotte will we can follow up with you .
this is for you if you want it .
i dunno if you wanna post it someplace or not .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
right so and then you just need to follow up as they call you to continue on if it &apos;s a benefit for you to do that .
here &apos;s your gift card and there will be more of those as they talk to you .
we can stop this .
i &apos;m remembering how to use this tape recorder .
okay you &apos;re gonna have to remind me .
do you go by thomas .
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know it was a t and i knew you didn &apos;t go by your first name .
i didn &apos;t know you went by scott .
okay i &apos;m sorry about that .
it &apos;s the end of the day and by brain starts turning off you know .
thanks for participating in this study .
on this study i &apos;m the interventionist .
i &apos;m the social worker on the clinical and on the study on interventionist .
and what i want today is just chat with you about substance use .
great then .
okay good .
alicia .
really .
so i know from that comment that you were using more three and a half years ago .
okay .
i remember you mentioning that you were in recovery the last time we talked .
recovery was my word it wasn &apos;t your word .
mm-hmm .
wow .
did you kind of had an epiphany or anything that .
.
mm-hmm .
really .
wow that &apos;s amazing .
that &apos;s a big event a parent passing away that &apos;s major .
can we chat about the paperwork .
of the you answered a lot of the questions with alicia .
and one section of the questions that you answered is called the dast the drug abuse screening tool .
it &apos;s a ten point screen .
and it measures the risk of harm that one might have in relation to their substance use .
and so on a scale of actually zero to ten .
uh how does it go here zero being no risk one or two being some risk three to five being moderate risk six to ten being severe risk .
where do you think you fall on that scale .
okay .
okay so on the dast you scored a four .
so what .
close enough .
well and actually a zero to three well so this is the triangle here .
so zero to two is no risk to some risk .
three is moderate risk four is moderate risk .
you say it &apos;s congruent .
okay tell me more about that .
why is that .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so severe is for relapse .
is that what you mean .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
and how as an escape did it harm you .
how did the substance use harm you .
well .
i see .
your liver disease is the .
mm-hmm it &apos;s not because of your substances .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
.
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm yeah i remember you telling me this last time .
yeah .
it &apos;s been a lot .
mm-hmm .
there &apos;s two boxes checked here .
but i think that one of them is not counting .
yeah .
the opiates for pain which is .
i &apos;m not sure these are included at all when your answering these questions up here .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m saying i don &apos;t see how this one can count right now because you are .
this is opiates that are being prescribed for pain which are related to your liver disease right .
and have they done a biopsy on that yet .
are they going to do a biopsy .
okay .
did they confirm that it &apos;s a pata cellular carcinoma .
because when i think i last saw you that was suspected but not yet confirmed .
.
is that polycost sot .
that &apos;s whether yeah doctors don &apos;t like to use those words because they &apos;re predicting the future and they don &apos;t like to do that .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm you &apos;re not avoiding the world anymore .
okay .
did ya wow .
yes back to this .
right and have you been how long have you been smoking marijuana .
okay .
it started before the cancer it &apos;s not .
.
yes .
so what are your thoughts on that .
how do you feel on your marijuana use .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so you have more than one motivation then .
that &apos;s great .
you have .
you have the motivation of maybe to qualify or wanting to qualify for the liver transplant and the motivation of really wanting to enjoy your mind and how you think and to stay sharp and yeah .
.
.
and what is the .
so you mentioned a few minutes ago .
but you &apos;ve been backing off .
what &apos;ve you been doing .
tell me more about that .
.
.
have you actually then reduced your use .
wow that &apos;s great .
just the period of time were diagnosed .
that &apos;s great wow .
.
so it sounds like your one of those lucky people who once you set your mind to doing something you can do it on your own .
you don &apos;t need any support you don &apos;t need any regular check in with a support group or anything like that or .
.
.
.
is that a big argument in aa .
i wasn &apos;t aware of that .
is it a kind of a philosophical under pendulum you have to get on board with in order to a .
well right .
that came out a long time ago .
the details are fuzzy but i remember .
.
yeah that was a good movie .
.
yeah .
.
.
it seems so much more empowering to make it a choice .
.
back to the original question .
are you one of these people who can do things once you put your mind to it .
is that how it &apos;s feeling with giving up the marijuana .
that you feel this is fine i &apos;m gonna be able to do this .
good .
good .
yes i wanted to ask you about stress too .
because last time you and i spoke there were a lot of stress isn &apos;t .
stress make it difficult to achieve a goal .
i asked this in a spirit this intervention but also in the spirit of i lost encounter .
you and i was supposed to follow up .
i &apos;ve been told you don &apos;t have to split the roles completely .
i can be interventionist and social worker and at the same time thank goodness .
you are committed to this goal of giving up marijuana .
which is great .
and i want to just offer any support you need around creating whatever you need to create in order to .
well you know i checked the other day and you weren &apos;t on my schedule .
there &apos;s no follow up appointments .
yeah &apos; cause i i think that this is .
uh have you applied for social security yet .
okay .
housing .
yeah so .
yeah it &apos;s probably just keeping track of all the medical appointments and such .
hm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
do you want to follow up with me then .
i &apos;m available .
do you want to follow up .
i saw that .
i was glad to see that you were getting in to see her .
or him i can &apos;t remember if the psychiatrist is a male or female .
but i was glad to see that .
do you happen to know your harbor view number .
i think i might just be able to find it &apos; cause there &apos;s not a lot of checking in there we go .
okay .
.
we have so many appointments coming up .
and i want to make the appointment on the day that your already gonna be here if at all possible .
tuesday the fifteenth i am .
i need to figure out where i can squeeze you in .
so that says you got interventional radiology .
on the fifteenth .
that &apos;s what you got .
okay .
tuesday the fifteenth .
whoa your talking the eighth sorry .
i &apos;m already a week ahead of myself .
.
did they take good care of ya .
did the nurses go doubt on you .
no .
okay .
surprised them .
i can probably see you at one o &apos;clock that day .
i have to ask somebody to overbook you .
you have an appointment at nine .
but unfortunately people schedule at ten and eleven .
you also have an appointment with financial counseling at eleven .
.
let &apos;s do one .
no i &apos;m just gonna be i &apos;ve a meeting that day and .
i have a meeting that day then miss for so that &apos;s okay .
well .
i can see you on the tenth at eleven o &apos;clock .
but it &apos;s a you don &apos;t have any appointments on that day so .
thursday .
so a week from today .
okay do you have your blue slip .
&apos; cause i can &apos;t overbook on my schedule .
i have to have the front desk do that for me .
i &apos;m gonna write on there for them .
i hope you have a blue slip .
usually every patient gets a blue slip but sometimes the provider takes it .
so you were seeing the pharmacist today .
i bet the pharmacist took it .
i &apos;m gonna write it down then .
just hand this to the front desk .
we have a plan .
we can actually part of the intervention is for me to check in with you in week and so and we &apos;ll check in on that day and that &apos;s the other .
yeah efficient .
so and then we can plan more on the holidays .
yeah okay .
good .
good i &apos;m glad to hear that .
okay i have to get used to your sense of humor honestly .
this is for you to keep these fliers here i keep this .
i &apos;m really glad that we got to connect again .
we &apos;re done .
i can turn this off i suppose .
it should not take too long .
i &apos;m just gonna set that there between us .
and thank you again for agreeing to participate in this .
i know that this is you had joey ask you a lot of questions .
did you wonder what that was all about .
okay .
okay alright well one of the things he did with the total numbers was to add it up and score you on a dast score .
and that &apos;s this little pyramid here and it &apos;s called the drug alcohol and abuse assessments tool .
and so looking at what other people have and the way you responded to the answers it kinda puts you at a seven which is up here at the top of the pyramid .
does that surprise you .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
so tell me about that .
tell me what you &apos;ve done as far as trying to control it .
and first of all what is it to control .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
wow .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
how long .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay good so tell me you described it as an addiction .
do you believe that you have an addiction right now .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm so what &apos;s different today .
why don &apos;t you want to .
go out .
mm-hmm .
so i wanna see if i can get directed the right way i &apos;ve never spoke to a social worker or a case manager or nothing like that mental evaluation counselor or nothing .
uh-huh uh-huh .
okay but it sounds like there are days that when you choose not to use that there &apos;s something going on within you that makes you decide today isn &apos;t gonna be the day .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
so .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
yeah .
so it sounds like that today when you &apos;re choosing not to use that it has to do with you wanting to remain healthy and you want to remain intelligent so that if that opportunity for a job should come up you can take it .
yeah yeah well those are good strong reasons huh .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
so what are the advantages of that for you what .
mm-hmm .
wow .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
wow .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm well what we &apos;re talking about in this particular study right now is just to see what you have used in your daily life as cues to use or to not use and that &apos;s one of the things we &apos;re looking at right now .
when i ask you like today you see health as being very important to you and being sharp and being able to get that job is very important to you .
it sounds like also meeting with your family and getting back connected with them is very important to you .
so now let &apos;s maybe talk about .
on the days you do use what &apos;s going on .
no i we &apos;re just gonna talk about this .
yeah .
yeah .
well .
okay .
yeah .
well .
no i thought we could just talk for a few minutes about your drug use and what goes on .
which is why we &apos;re kind of exploring some of .
what are the things that .
okay well well let &apos;s talk .
let &apos;s talk about the things that on the days that you do use if that &apos;s okay with you .
is that okay with you if we continue .
right .
yeah .
uh-huh .
what would you like us to be doing right now .
uh-huh .
okay .
so .
so you .
well i .
wasn &apos;t planning on going .
for an hour .
yeah well we &apos;ve probably been talking about ten minutes .
and it .
yeah .
well the twenty minutes is probably what would be with me .
alright .
well we can .
so you &apos;re feeling like you &apos;re all done talking about this now .
we &apos;re just gonna talk we &apos;re just gonna talk this is what joey asked you .
these are some of the things you circled .
right .
uh-huh .
is that okay .
no it &apos;s probably .
well i &apos;m trying to help you and we &apos;re trying to look at what are positive reasons for you when you don &apos;t use and then again what are things that are going on letting you explore what some of your thoughts on .
really .
who have you gone over it with .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
it &apos;s not does it get you .
sounds like it gets you upset talking .
uh-huh uh-huh .
okay .
okay but again if we could kinda go back and because we looked at the positive things that you see when you &apos;re not using .
you &apos;ve got some really positive strong things that you &apos;ve told me about when you &apos;re not using .
but i &apos;m not really clear what you &apos;re thinking about when you do go out to use .
so it does it make you unhealthy .
does it just kind of see what your cues are what gets you to decide to use .
okay .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
.
really .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
that sounds like it &apos;s pretty frustrating for you .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so how did you cope with that .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so .
when you talk about your addiction you were talking about there &apos;s some times when you do have to use or .
when did you last use .
okay what was going on yesterday .
mm-hmm how did that make you feel .
did you know what did you have some feeling when you went out to get your drugs .
or was there something going on that day or .
no .
no .
but today you &apos;re feeling better about .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
just doesn &apos;t work .
so you want something .
.
uh-huh .
so you want to go into treatment .
you wanna talk about going into treatment .
so what do you think would be proper for you then .
okay .
.
uh-huh .
what .
don &apos;t approve of what .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
how would somebody do something about it .
tell me what you mean by that .
because i &apos;m not really clear .
i mean you just told me that you really don &apos;t know if you want inpatient treatment or if you want any treatment .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
so it sounds like you don &apos;t feel like you can stop yourself .
okay .
and yet today you &apos;re not using and don &apos;t feel like using .
yeah .
yeah so what &apos;s the turning point .
i guess that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to see is what &apos;s the turning point .
if you can go a few weeks and there must be some trigger there that makes you turn to it .
you can have .
this this is the paperwork he gave me .
yeah yeah but this is all i get from him and you &apos;re welcome to it .
because it just .
i know .
and this is .
and this is part of the study i don &apos;t get to see i only get this and this .
and so i have to ask you some of the questions as part of the study .
am i asking the i don &apos;t know honestly i don &apos;t know because i don &apos;t do the whole thing that he does .
okay .
okay .
mm-hmm .
tell me .
why you &apos;re disappointed though .
i &apos;m not really clear because .
okay .
okay .
so .
okay .
well .
you know what i &apos;m gonna just give you this .
do you want to continue in the study because he &apos;s gonna call i &apos;ll call you back he &apos;ll call you back i &apos;ll just talk to you on the phone .
probably in a couple weeks .
i &apos;ll call you in a couple weeks then he &apos;ll call you in three months .
my .
my hope is that you and i could come up with a solution and maybe you could talk to me a bit more .
because i .
you .
this is a study again as i said before .
and i appreciate you agreeing to it .
but part of the study is to kind of work on the questions i ask .
and he doesn &apos;t know what you and i talk about either because it is a study and it has to so i &apos;m the interventionist he &apos;s the person who helps gather the information and the people who qualify and that part of it .
oh yeah and i &apos;m not .
really clear what .
with family .
okay .
so .
who else have you talked about it with .
okay so people in your life .
and you care about .
and yet you also told me that you really hadn &apos;t talked to anybody about it when we first spoke .
so i &apos;m .
.
and how do you mean resolve it .
yeah .
so what you want is a magic something that &apos;s going to stop it from happening .
is it .
okay that &apos;s right .
so but so .
tell me one of the somethings that you think would take care of the problem .
can you tell me what your expectation is .
because then we can talk about that .
okay so if talking won &apos;t take care of it what will take care of it .
right .
right and i don &apos;t know of anything that &apos;s gonna take care of it until we explore .
okay .
yeah .
i think the thing that &apos;s gonna take care of it is inside of you and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to explore .
you know because nobody is with you twenty four hours a day it &apos;s you and your thoughts .
do you agree or .
well i think us talking about it and maybe you having thoughts about it might help .
no okay .
.
so if we didn &apos;t .
yeah i know i can tell you &apos;re really upset i can tell you &apos;re really upset but i &apos;m still not clear what your expectation is .
uh-huh .
so .
okay .
yeah it sounds like all you .
mm-hmm .
so .
when you were talking to him .
okay so what would you want to happen after you saw that .
okay .
well i don &apos;t know either i don &apos;t .
know either what you .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so you want to be healthy .
mm-hmm .
okay .
well .
so it &apos;s the time that &apos;s bothering you the most .
okay .
alright .
yeah but we &apos;re still conversing .
and i &apos;m still trying to see if there &apos;s something that you want what exactly it is that you want you don &apos;t have .
and you don &apos;t know .
okay .
okay well since you &apos;re anxious to leave .
and i don &apos;t wanna keep you .
and we can talk sometime on a different level when you come into see doctor enzian .
but these are some of the resources that he provides for you to look at .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm sometimes that &apos;s the case .
mm-hmm .
it &apos;s interesting .
so you have talked to some of these people at some .
mm-hmm .
yeah yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
yeah .
so it sounds like you don &apos;t wanna be inconvenienced .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah well i can &apos;t call them .
do you know why .
right .
yeah .
yeah .
it can be frustrating .
.
mm-hmm .
d s h s gave you that .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
so it does feel like you &apos;ve been really really frustrated with this situation and that you want something different than what &apos;s been offered to you in the past .
most of the places want to speak with you directly .
because like i &apos;m talking with you right now part of it is is that you &apos;re the one who needs the assistance and they want to talk to you directly about what &apos;s going on with you and what the problem is .
yeah .
yeah yeah and it does take time you &apos;re right and i do know that i do know that .
so i sense that you really wanna go is that .
okay .
so what i &apos;m gonna do is here &apos;s your certificate and .
no i don &apos;t it &apos;s yours .
you spent .
the time .
well if you look at it it &apos;s a gift card to these different stores q f c kroger stores q f c or fred meyer .
yeah .
and again i appreciate you participating in the study .
yeah i think if you &apos;re bending it you &apos;re breaking it .
that &apos;s good .
so .
mm-hmm .
so .
this is all yours if you want it .
okay .
uh-huh .
set it here i guess .
so i don &apos;t know how much they told you about what we would be talking about or .
i can give you a little background so basically our study is looking at drug use .
and the purpose today is basically for us to just talk about your drug use .
but you don &apos;t need to make a change that &apos;s not why i &apos;m talking to you .
i &apos;m not trying to drug counseling about abstinence or anything like that .
so we &apos;re really interested in why people use what it means to them things like that .
and then we follow up and check in on you and how you &apos;re doing .
but it &apos;s more of an informal conversation really focused on what you think about your use so .
so that .
um kinda tell me a little bit about your .
you &apos;re using marijuana .
oh .
yeah .
wow .
oh my god .
gees .
wow .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
gosh .
uh-huh .
wow .
wow .
uh-huh .
yeah .
wow .
so you &apos;ve had a go of it your whole life it sounds like every kinda turn or something happening .
yeah .
yeah so it &apos;s never really been for you an issue in your life .
yeah and it sounds like .
oh .
so you &apos;ve had other people kinda look at this and say this is still not okay .
that must be really tough .
uh-huh so you feel like .
alright yeah so you feel like you have to kind of justify this a lot and kind of explain your story and your pain it feels kind of like an uphill battle .
so it sounds like in your experience sometimes when you &apos;re using people will come up and be like why are you doing that or what &apos;s going on and you have to explain it or .
is that .
i don &apos;t know if you can tell me a little bit more about that .
or how that feels for you .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
so you really just want privacy kind of .
yeah .
yeah .
right .
so you &apos;ve been feeling pretty depressed it sounds like .
yeah .
yeah .
right .
right .
right you have to go .
yeah .
right so this has been not just something to help you with the pain or really just to get through every day kinda getting motivated and getting out things like that .
so it sounds like even just to get out of the house sometimes you feel like you need to smoke to do that oh .
yeah .
huh uh-huh .
yeah that sounds aggravating .
uh-huh .
okay .
so this is kind of like for emotional regulation .
you feel like .
and it sounds like specifically with anger too that it kinda helps you to chill out or .
.
i can imagine .
yeah .
you &apos;ve got a lot to be angry about .
yeah .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
right .
right so it kind of brought up some big questions for you .
yeah i can imagine .
that &apos;s also really difficult smoking being in the christian community .
uh-huh .
oh .
uh-huh .
right .
right .
the reverse .
yeah yeah .
mm .
yeah .
oh gosh .
yeah .
wow so your whole life has been affected by this .
yeah .
yeah yeah kind of an outlet for you and also kinda feeling like another normal kid .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah right yeah .
it makes sense .
so you kinda took a risk for your health to be able to fit in and to feel normal .
yeah .
so .
right so you feel like you &apos;re always hiding .
yeah .
so you feel like you have a lot to kind of hold back and not let people know about to try to prove that you &apos;re okay and you want to participate and and it sounds like that at church too that there are other people that were kinda hiding their medical marijuana but you &apos;re tired of that .
mm yeah .
right .
mm-hmm .
right .
right .
yeah .
yeah so you &apos;re really trying to kind of have personal control over your health .
and people might be judging your choice around marijuana use especially in the church .
.
okay .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
okay .
okay .
uh-huh uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah yeah .
yeah .
right .
yeah they kinda push you away or they expect less from you .
mm-hmm .
oh yeah that &apos;s tough .
so you did the song first because you didn &apos;t wanna experience that .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm .
right so you did that and then you told them .
and then what happened .
yeah it sounds like they really liked it .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
yeah .
right so it &apos;s testing their faith but for you you never felt that way yeah .
right .
like you said yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm yeah .
oh my god .
wow .
ahh .
nothing .
ahh .
that &apos;s horrible .
i &apos;m sure you and your family were just devastated .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm so marijuana was kind of a way to save your family in a way .
oh what happened .
oh .
wow .
right so you had an experience in your family where the marijuana they actually took it to be .
oh my god .
wow .
yeah .
so this is a huge deal the legalization of marijuana for you because that would have saved your family a lot of pain .
oh my god .
uh-huh .
oh no .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
right .
right .
yeah they need both .
that love and the .
oh .
yeah .
yeah .
right .
.
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
so it felt like a thing that brought you guys together it was a bonding experience .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
oh .
geez .
wow .
right .
yeah .
yeah .
right .
so it kind of helps you to feel a little bit better to know that there are people even in the president that have problems like every other person but in texas it sounds like they legally kind of attacked people like that huh but for you it felt like .
yeah .
yeah gees .
yeah wow so you &apos;ve had an incredible life story and a long relationship with the marijuana that sounds like it really saved you from pain and then you also have some mixed feelings about what happened .
wow .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
right so you have .
yeah you &apos;ve been there and you really have a handle on kind of the ethical .
there &apos;s a lot of ethical questions that come up with drug use .
and you kind of have been on the side of someone that &apos;s really benefited from this .
so going forward what do you want to have your life look like in your relationship with marijuana and with how it is in your life and with other people .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
oh gees .
yeah .
gees .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm yeah .
right .
right .
yeah .
yeah so in the future .
yeah .
yeah i mean it sounds like you have the experience and the knowledge about what would help the system kind of from your first hand experience .
and in the future for you it sounds like you &apos;d like a safe place to live and you want to grow your own so that you know what you &apos;re getting .
so right now are you getting it from dispensaries or .
right .
but you &apos;d still like more control over kind of what exactly you &apos;re getting and how that looks .
and then it sounds like you &apos;re gonna be working with your group at your church to kind of work on this acceptance and understanding around how you &apos;ve been in this world and how marijuana fits in .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
oh right .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah but not .
really enough .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm .
right so you wanna set up some sort of cooperative where people that have serious disabilities or are sick can come and not have to pay those prices .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
wow well .
yeah it sounds like you &apos;ve kind of turned your life experiences that other people have judged or been really difficult it sounds like you &apos;re turning it into something really positive around and giving back to other people you just need to get the pieces in place to do that .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm hmm .
oh yeah .
mm .
yeah so she &apos;s worried for you involved in any legal issues .
yeah .
mm .
right so it sounds like when you &apos;re gonna do this you &apos;re make sure you do it in the most legal way possible so something like that doesn &apos;t happen to you .
can &apos;t .
really make money or yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm yeah .
like a non profit .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah yeah cool .
well that &apos;s about the amount of time we have .
is there .
oh no i didn &apos;t mean to i mean we all just end whenever .
but i really appreciated hearing your perspective today .
i think a lot of people that that use marijuana they have different reasons for doing it .
and just hearing your story it sounds like you really have an inspiration on how you want this to look for you in the future .
and you &apos;ve been through a lot of pain that this has helped so it &apos;s understandable where you &apos;re at .
so yeah so the last thing you need to be doing is apologizing .
this is exactly what our study is about so .
i am a study interventionist .
so basically i only work on these research studies and help people by doing what we &apos;re doing right now .
well we only have about one minute here .
uh-huh .
wow .
those are cool .
good for you wow these are really precise really beautiful .
cool so what are you doing with these .
those are neat .
oh .
and it was not that good yeah .
oh well i &apos;m really happy to see you using your creative talents .
and there are a lot of people i think that would be inspired by your story so more power to you i hope you keep doing art and .
uh huh .
there you go .
yeah well it sounds like it &apos;s a really good community there that they care about you .
and you &apos;re kind of you have this way just from our short conversation today of kind of moving forward and contributing so it &apos;s really inspirational i think they &apos;re right to say that .
alright so yeah .
and you actually helped us out today too just by talking .
so you get all these gift cards .
yeah .
and .
yeah i &apos;m sure yeah .
.
there we go .
cool alright so calvin i thank you for coming in and being part of this study and answering some questions .
and do you know what it was that you were the questions you were answering .
do you know what that was about .
uh-huh .
okay .
okay so you answered a bunch of questions having to do with the drugs right .
it &apos;s called the dast and you were given a score .
do you have an idea of what that score was .
moderate .
okay do you want me to tell you what it was .
it was seven .
so here &apos;s this triangle right here okay look at this in here so here is this is how much harm does your drug use expose you to .
so it &apos;s up there at severe risk from six to ten .
and moderate &apos;s so it &apos;s a little higher than you were thinking .
does that surprise you .
yeah this is the questions .
so it sounds like it &apos;s pretty straightforward yes no kind of questions .
uh-huh .
sure .
yeah yeah so that sounds like that might be a surprise that it &apos;s severe risk versus moderate .
.
you &apos;re funny you &apos;re funny .
no but i &apos;m hearing this is a surprise .
just to back up a little bit .
we &apos;re meeting together not that i &apos;m gonna push any treatment or anything like that it &apos;s just to have a conversation .
yeah and so the conversation &apos;s started .
and here we are and you &apos;re looking at this and you were thinking you were moderate .
now you &apos;re hearing you &apos;re severe and kinda sitting with that .
and so i heard you say some things like being an addict .
so tell me more about that .
what &apos;s that .
mm .
mm .
so i &apos;m hearing when you &apos;re high and you &apos;re kind of cruising along you don &apos;t really think about it you just sort of cruise and every once in a while something pops up like this where you go oh gees .
the normal range is right down here sort of right here .
wow so you &apos;re saying that when you get high you get in trouble .
and it is just starting to click that after all these years you &apos;ve been feeling kind of depressed and whatever these getting in trouble but then now you &apos;re looking at it i don &apos;t know how old you are but now you look at it as like gees every time i got in trouble i was using .
wow .
wow .
so when you &apos;re sober you think about goals .
uh-huh things you wanna do and then when you &apos;re cruising on drugs you &apos;re sort of thinking about just .
what .
yeah get more drugs sort of .
and then also boom you &apos;re in trouble and bam get thrown in jail or get hurt .
have you been hurt .
oh my god .
yeah so bad .
stuff .
oh man .
bad stuff happened okay .
wow so when you look at this then this severe risk what &apos;s a couple words that .
so you think .
okay .
so tell me how important is it for you to change your drug use in terms of one to ten .
nine .
why isn &apos;t it like six or four .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so that .
so yeah it takes away from all those goals you were talking about you wanna do yeah cool .
how confident are you from one to ten that you could make this change .
mm-hmm .
so by living the way you &apos;re living you keep running in you get triggers .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm so it sounds like your number is really high up there confident and you &apos;re way up there at the top that you can make a change .
the only .
thing that you &apos;re saying is that it &apos;s lifestyle .
.
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
the what .
mm .
mm .
you sound like a pretty reflective guy .
but when you &apos;re .
but i &apos;m .
hearing you really thinking about a lot of things like your goals that you know you have goals when you &apos;re clean sober and you know that when you get high you get in trouble and some scary stuff has happened .
yeah so that sounds kind of out of the voice of reason you &apos;re a mature guy you &apos;re yeah you &apos;re reflecting you &apos;re thinking about all these things about where you &apos;ve been where you wanna go .
mm-hmm .
yeah i also heard how clearly you said you &apos;d like to some day have life clean and sober .
in fact you marked it down here too you said you would like to have a clean and sober lifestyle maybe slip up once in a while but clean and sober .
and yeah there are option for change .
there &apos;s well or no change you could leave it the way it is .
or you could completely stop abstain .
you could choose not to you know those places where you got in trouble and make sure if you &apos;re gonna use and get high make sure that you &apos;re doing something in a place where you &apos;ll not get in trouble .
like not go to that bar where you know that so-and-so is always there and every time you get high you guys get into it .
eliminating those things you stay safe or don &apos;t drive or don &apos;t operate machinery or things like that you know .
there are other options you could keep it as it is .
not use at all .
try to use in a way that &apos;s more safe .
and there &apos;s also getting support around it too the counseling services and things like that .
i have a list here you &apos;re welcome to take with you .
and you could look at that .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re hooked up with any other places .
but it &apos;s something to chew on .
but i &apos;ve heard that you &apos;ve said the reasons you wanna make a change was because you wanna have a life worth living you &apos;re tired of getting yourself in these situations where you get hurt and bad stuff happens scary things happen i &apos;m hearing real clearly that it &apos;s important for you and that you &apos;re pretty confident that you can do it .
.
yeah and i &apos;m also hearing you say that it &apos;s not only the lifestyle but it &apos;s the addiction but you gave yourself really high marks on that you &apos;re really confident that you can do it but dealing with the addiction and lifestyle kinda habits .
and i think you can do it .
there &apos;s a lot of reasons why .
one you &apos;re thinking about these things .
and i see a lot of folks that are mature and that they sort of looked at their lives like where have i been what do i do next and they get some radical changes in their life .
and i think that &apos;s something you can do .
yeah .
cool .
yeah i really appreciate your honesty about it .
but you didn &apos;t hide you didn &apos;t hide behind anything .
you were real clear when you said that you all of a sudden realized that when you looked back and the times you got in trouble you were high and that really says that you know that that &apos;s not you .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
well i wish you all the best .
here &apos;s these i understand you got five earlier so here &apos;s two tens .
cool .
you &apos;re welcome .
you &apos;re welcome and good luck to you .
and i &apos;ll give you a call in a couple weeks okay .
okay .
okay .
okay .
you &apos;re welcome .
you too .
okay today is july first and the time is ten fifty three am .
and i have here juan garcia .
mister garcia is it okay if i record this conversation today .
okay great .
well thanks for participating in the survey .
what was that experience for you out there when you were filling out all that paperwork and .
was it did it go okay for you .
okay okay so i just want to let you know that i &apos;m not here to judge you in any way or to make you change in any way okay .
i &apos;m really just here to talk to you about your drug use .
okay .
okay so it looks like this questionnaire you filled out it &apos;s called the drug abuse screening test .
based on your answers to that questionnaire you fell in the moderate risk of harm .
so there &apos;s no risk some risk moderate risk and then severe risk .
okay you fell in this right here this range .
what do you think about that .
what do you think about the results .
you seem a little surprised .
okay tell me more .
tell me more about that .
okay so it looks like your drug of choice is what marijuana and alcohol .
okay well tell me about that .
tell me about your use .
okay .
okay and so do you use weed and alcohol then every day .
okay can you give me an example of when you do use it .
and then when you don &apos;t use it .
okay you said it depends on your mood right .
okay so even if you &apos;re both in a bad mood and good mood you use it you use it anyways .
okay because you said earlier that it depends on how you feel the amount that you use and how long you use .
okay so it sounds like you pretty much use it then no matter how you &apos;re feeling good or bad or in between .
you use it anyways .
what were you using back then .
so you say you &apos;ve stopped you &apos;ve been sober from clean and sober from coke for at least thirty years .
wow .
boy what was that like using it back then .
so yeah what was it that made you stop .
okay did you .
how did you do that .
okay .
okay so did coke in any way interfere with your life .
okay do you feel that using pot and drinking do you think that interferes at all with your life .
well what do you see are some of the good things about using and some of the bad things .
say if you were to pick one between alcohol and marijuana which one would you be using .
okay so with pot .
do you have a preference as to one .
okay so what do you see are some good things about using pot .
and what are some bad negative things about using pot .
okay okay um-hmm that &apos;s not cheap right .
okay and do you see any other negative .
um-hum .
well tell me about the good things .
so it helps relaxes you and makes you feel better .
okay so on the one hand you &apos;re saying that .
okay .
okay so on one hand you &apos;re saying that you know on the positive side of using pot it calms your nerves and sort of makes you more even even mood right .
what you &apos;re saying is you don &apos;t really think that should be a good enough reason to be using marijuana and then on the negative side it &apos;s pretty costly .
you know well it sounds like it &apos;s important for you to use though .
okay so if you were able to leave it you know what would that look like .
okay so you okay so you would stop if your for example your employer is gonna is gonna ua you .
so you would stop because you now that there &apos;s a risk right and being found out .
okay well that &apos;s good i &apos;m glad to hear that you &apos;re at work and you know you care about your job .
that &apos;s a big thing .
and that you don &apos;t you &apos;re not using when you &apos;re at work .
what do you do for a living .
okay do you like your job .
okay yeah great great it &apos;s good to hear it .
it sounds like it &apos;s really important to your job is .
because you &apos;re not using when you &apos;re there and you care about what happens to you right but you &apos;re also saying on the other hand you really don &apos;t care if anyone else .
i thought so .
so keeping your job is .
okay okay all right so at this point on a scale of one to ten .
ten is the highest .
how important is it for you to continue using .
okay .
can you tell me more about that .
why would it be half .
um-hum .
okay .
so if you were .
what things would force you to quit you think .
okay so a lot of it really has to do with your ability to earn money right .
and income .
is that right .
okay how do you think using pot is linked to your health .
you &apos;re being seen at family medicine clinic .
what brought you into the clinic today .
your back .
okay okay so how long have you had back problems .
okay did you get that from an injury or .
okay so it &apos;s been a couple years since your back started hurting and it comes on and off .
do you take anything for that .
what &apos;s your doctor say about it .
okay okay so you what do you think about marijuana and your back issue .
do you think they &apos;re linked at all your marijuana and .
okay you said earlier that the marijuana sort of relaxes you right .
puts you in a better or an even more mood .
does it help too with the muscle-relaxing piece of it .
on what .
um-hum well do you have any other health problems .
um-hum .
so you said you have asthma .
okay so you see a doctor for that .
oh you do have an inhaler okay .
yeah some people develop it when they become adults .
yeah no you can get it as an adult too .
so do you see a link at all with using marijuana and having asthma .
okay well can i share with you what i know about that .
well you know cigarettes are not good for you right .
smoking at all is not good for you .
but i believe that with marijuana the impact on your lungs and respiratory is much more worse than smoking cigarettes so that will affect how you breathe .
so if you want to know more about that you can talk to your doctor too .
i mean they &apos;re always there .
and i hope you have a relationship with your doctor .
okay so mister garcia if the time were right .
right now you &apos;re saying that you &apos;re fifty fifty between quitting and not quitting .
um what would you do .
if the time were right to stop using what would you do .
what would that look like .
okay so it would take .
okay so unless they were your employer right .
unless you feel like it would be too risky depending on the good jobs and .
okay and then that brings back again to your ideal or how much you value your job as an important part of your life .
is that right .
okay .
okay .
okay so it sounds like you &apos;re really cautious about making sure you &apos;re not caught right .
okay okay so .
okay so the legal possibilities concerns you if you were to get caught .
have you .
it sounds like you have you been there before .
okay okay so .
okay .
okay well yeah right i mean you haven &apos;t learned your lesson as you say in your own words .
because you still use it right .
and you &apos;re still talking about not caring unless it &apos;s job related .
okay well how many times were you busted i guess in the past .
two times okay .
and what happened then .
okay so you were smoking pot both times .
in public .
were you arrested .
and did you end up going to court .
what happened there .
okay so one of the cases got dismissed .
what about the other one .
okay does it concern you at all worry at all if say a third time happens and .
and there &apos;s more .
of repercussions .
okay .
okay two years ago was the last time .
um-hmm honesty is good and you &apos;ve surely been honest with me today .
so i do appreciate that .
okay so at this point the way i see it then is that you &apos;re kind of thinking about changing or stopping using but you &apos;re feeling that unless it impacts your job you &apos;re not going to stop .
did i get that right .
okay and you &apos;re also concerned about .
so it sounds like the job thing is always a goal that you &apos;re looking at you &apos;d like to get a better job .
are you looking for other work then or .
okay okay but here &apos;s the thing you always have choices right .
you &apos;re an adult you have choices so you can either manage how you &apos;re using instead of doing it every day .
you do it every other day or you know manage how you &apos;re going to use it use it less frequently .
you could quit altogether that &apos;s your other option .
sounds like you &apos;re sort of not there yet at this point .
take less risks when you &apos;re using .
have you thought about that sort of unsafety when you are using .
okay so you do do it at home .
okay do you get behind the wheel .
do you drive .
okay do you watch kids when you are high .
okay you look out right .
when you say you look out what do you look out for .
okay but you say you &apos;re not driving .
okay any other choices you &apos;d make no changes .
you like things .
the other choice you have also is that you make no changes .
you sort of leave things where they &apos;re at .
and then your other your fifth choice is to get some help .
you know that right .
okay so yeah i mean you have the power to to make you have the power and the choices to think about and it &apos;s what you do with it it &apos;s up to you .
so what i did want to do is give you this resource list of places to seek help .
if that fifth choice is what you want to do .
okay because i think you know ultimately the risk i mean the point is to take you from this moderate risk and bring you down to really sort of no risk .
right because this questionnaire right here this d a s t score triangle that you &apos;re looking at .
the higher you go up on this triangle that means the more at risk you &apos;ll be .
you &apos;ll be more likely to get to develop health problems .
you &apos;re more likely to get into legal situations .
you &apos;re more likely to affect your mental health emotional well being .
the higher you go up on this triangle .
okay okay so mister garcia i want to follow up with you in about one week .
what &apos;s a good number to call you .
zero three three two .
okay is there a better time in the day to call you .
okay so i hope you remember my name when i do call .
irena fahardo .
okay .
so at this point i don &apos;t .
you know we talked about the choices right .
and you &apos;re saying you &apos;re really not willing to do anything at this point sort of leave things status quo .
okay that resource list i gave you right there are you willing to at least take a look at that .
read it and maybe when we talk in about a week sort of talk about what &apos;s on there .
can you agree to that .
okay great .
okay mister garcia thank you so much for talking with me today .
and let &apos;s see the time is eleven seventeen and this interview is concluding thank you .
okay so it &apos;s going now and we &apos;re gonna record this conversation .
and i &apos;d like to thank you for participating and staying around to meet with joey .
okay so what joey asked you you &apos;ve spent a lot of time with him answering a lot of questions and stuff .
what he did was he gives me this sort of profile of what you kinda talked about and then he scores you on this pyramid as to where you are at risk with your behaviors .
it &apos;s called the dast score d a s t and it stands for the drug abuse and screening test .
and that &apos;s from what you two talked about is kind of how it might .
for affecting your health your life your social interactions .
does that .
kind of surprise you where you are or .
no .
mm-hmm .
so you &apos;re feeling better about this score it sounds like .
so tell me a bit about it why did you think you would be severe .
okay .
uh-huh .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
right .
yeah .
yeah .
okay so this is a positive thing for you .
that &apos;s good that &apos;s good .
so well it sounds like when you talk about the temptation and being to cutting back .
have you cut back it sounds like .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
like what .
mm-hmm .
oh there you are .
uh-huh .
right .
would you have been different before if you had been using more .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right .
right right .
so it sounds like you have cut back considerably .
uh-huh .
and .
and since you &apos;ve cut back you &apos;ve been able to make some changes .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
so what made you change do you think .
what were the .
what &apos;s made you make some of the changes you &apos;ve made .
you &apos;re tired of being tired .
uh-huh .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
right .
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm so i was looking you &apos;ve got a number of things here checked .
which do you think you &apos;ve cut back on the most .
well you have on this thing he had you checked for alcohol cocaine marijuana and more than one substance per day .
is there anything that you would like to cut back .
is there anything you would like to cut back on .
all of it .
uh-huh .
you can &apos;t do it .
okay .
so you .
right well that &apos;s what it sounds like you &apos;ve done which is great .
i &apos;m just wondering if you at your own pace is there one that you &apos;re working on now .
everything .
uh-huh .
do you ever see a day where you don &apos;t use at all .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
giving back to .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
what &apos;s real .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
so does the religious component of the .
it helps you .
uh-huh .
does it keep you from using any drugs or .
mm-hmm so you use god to reduce when you want to not use or .
uh huh .
right right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
but you still have some drugs now when you .
mm-hmm .
you still use some occasionally some marijuana and .
yeah yeah .
can you see a time that you might not be interested in that .
oh or may i rephrase that .
let me say what i &apos;m trying to think .
so what would have to happen for you to decide that you didn &apos;t need that marijuana every day what would it .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
okay .
okay so you feel the marijuana is your medicinal medicine .
how about the cocaine .
is there a time when you can see where something would happen that would change that .
you wish it would .
okay .
mm-hmm .
when you try to shy away from it what are you doing .
reading .
okay so it sounds like when you &apos;re .
tell me what happens what you &apos;re doing when you would be using the cocaine .
what would be going on .
mm-hmm are you someplace that makes you wanna have the cocaine .
are you with some people at that time .
okay .
you can be home alone and just go out and buy some and .
okay .
so you kinda have somebody a young female friend who &apos;s using and you gotta go get some .
uh-huh .
no no no what i &apos;m trying to see is what makes you want to use not anybody else .
just what .
it was pain .
even for .
the cocaine .
okay so when the pain is really bad is when you wanna use .
is that .
yeah .
why is that crazy .
just trying to .
just trying to figure out what makes you want to use and what &apos;s going on when you decide to use .
and you told me some of it had to do with the pain .
and you told me you use the marijuana you &apos;re never gonna see not using marijuana for the pain .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
do you wanna knock off the crack .
you are knocking off the crack .
okay .
mm-hmm .
that .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
right .
right right .
they kind of forced you into it .
so it sounds like you &apos;ve cut back on the crack considerably except when .
am i wrong .
no no no no .
tell me .
no this isn &apos;t about what you i &apos;m just trying to find out what you .
or you want to you would like to you would like to see a day when you &apos;re crack free .
or no .
there &apos;s no right .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
a life how about a life .
a .
fresh life without crack .
but you &apos;d still have the marijuana .
do you see any relationship when you &apos;re using the marijuana that makes it easier for you to use the crack .
no okay .
.
okay .
alright .
well getting just quickly kind of if you were to have that new fresh life without crack how would you do that .
do you have a way of thinking about .
uh-huh to not get that crack every two or three days .
what would you like me to talk about .
mm-hmm .
okay .
okay so it &apos;s not a problem .
right but for you .
so you need to so .
so the best way for you is just to avoid the .
stay busy .
yeah .
uh-huh .
good good .
yeah .
so just to kinda summarize i don &apos;t wanna keep going back to that one thing is that if there &apos;s something that you would like to be without it &apos;s without that and the best way for you to kinda do that is to believe in god and do some of your preaching and be recognized for that and to stay away from the areas and to keep busy .
staying busy .
okay .
yeah yeah yeah because that &apos;s crazy making .
yeah .
.
alright well i appreciate you participating with us .
and i &apos;m probably gonna give you a call in a couple weeks about this .
we &apos;re still gonna be in touch about the other thing that we talked about .
i &apos;m gonna stop this .
think that that &apos;s gonna work it is .
okay so i &apos;m just gonna place it right there and .
okay so i know that you &apos;ve been through tests and been talking with claire .
and one of the tests that she gave you was the dast .
and that &apos;s a test that estimates harm based on your drug use .
and the way that they look at it .
a little handy triangle for you .
so your score can be zero to ten .
severe risk is considered six to ten moderate risk three to five some risk one to two .
okay .
so .
did she talk with you about what your score was .
do you wanna guess what your score was or did you see it .
you saw it .
two .
so some risk .
yeah does that surprise you .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
you don &apos;t .
so it sounds like you use marijuana to it helps you feel better .
uh-huh .
right .
it &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing .
yeah .
yeah how often do you feel so bad that you &apos;re using marijuana to help with the symptoms .
maybe in a week .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah so when you think about your use of marijuana how do you feel about it .
i mean do you feel like it works for you .
do you feel like there &apos;s anything that you need to change .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
yup well that &apos;s good .
has marijuana or other drugs ever been like that for you where you &apos;ve felt like you needed to have the .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
well it sounds like you use it in a way that &apos;s pretty controlled .
and that it works for you .
yeah .
you understand that there is some risk involved and then you are making decisions .
based on that to reduce risk .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah you &apos;re a thoughtful person .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
good .
well .
well .
well it seems to me like you &apos;re thoughtful of that how you &apos;re using and .
and it works for you .
and you &apos;re not interested in any kind of change and you understand that there are some risks .
and you &apos;re making accommodations for those .
mm-hmm .
it sounds like you &apos;re hoping there &apos;s a time when you &apos;re not gonna feel this way .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
now okay yup .
when i first .
yeah well .
you were .
having a hard time yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah sounds like it &apos;s organizing things a little bit think about and yeah .
right .
yeah .
right .
right .
yeah .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re doing that .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
well i think that you were talking about the time when we first met and then when i met you most recently i &apos;m just so impressed with what you have accomplished .
i feel you are moving along .
and we &apos;re working day to day and .
and it &apos;s obvious .
uh-huh .
yeah .
that &apos;s good .
so one of the things that you mentioned about your depression .
a lot of people have depression like you have depression .
and i think it &apos;s great that you &apos;re working on it .
and identifying it and realizing .
making the connections .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
good .
as you work on your depression and when you &apos;re ready i want you to think about the fact that marijuana is a depressant it does have that impact .
and so right now it sounds like you &apos;re .
yeah .
it &apos;s good .
but just keep in the back of your thoughts that .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
so you &apos;ve cut back quite a bit .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
good i &apos;m glad that connection is working for ya .
well i appreciate you meeting with me .
it was nice to walk out and see you there .
big difference .
you should be .
okay .
okay jana again thanks again for helping us with this study .
um did i hopefully you weren &apos;t waiting too long out there .
i didn &apos;t want to keep you waiting since we did kind of switch things up .
um did joey get a chance to explain the test to at all .
do you have questions about it .
okay okay what i &apos;d like to do is kind of pursue your results of the test .
because you scored out at a nine which was pretty high .
and joey talked about the scale for you .
and the risks involved .
not really .
do you want a little .
okay do you want me to just go over it really quick .
basically it &apos;s a test it &apos;s called the the the drug abuse screening test .
okay and it it &apos;s a questionnaire that &apos;s given to many adults .
and it measures the risk that &apos;s involved with drug use .
um medical risk psychological risks social risks and it &apos;s .
a scale from one to ten .
and you were in a nine .
okay and so .
that &apos;s not good huh .
what &apos;s your take on the nine .
yeah does the nine sound about right to you or .
okay .
have ya .
okay so weed .
there &apos;s weed .
like the past month or so .
okay .
hm you &apos;ve been pretty clean for the past three months .
okay .
tell me about that .
what &apos;s happened to change that for you .
okay okay .
that has something to do with it okay .
really .
that &apos;s difficult too .
okay .
does .
oh okay .
just overall .
wow so you got to the point where you realized i can &apos;t do this anymore .
really so the past three months or so you were saying .
yeah .
okay .
yeah yeah .
yeah .
so basically you quit your job so to speak .
well that &apos;s great but so .
ah-ha okay .
mental health here .
sound mental health okay .
i know it .
is here .
um-hum .
how did you hook up with sound .
oh i know him .
yeah in the rehab court .
over on fourth fourth floor over there .
oh and he referred you to sound .
okay .
yeah yeah .
i see i see .
okay .
okay .
so you initiated this actually .
good for you .
good for you .
yeah no good for you .
how did you happen to be in the rehab clinic .
ah you think it wasn &apos;t even the right place .
no that &apos;s interesting .
because you don &apos;t look you have many physical or even cognitive .
oh i see but that would be almost more of physical yeah physical therapy .
maybe it was meant to be huh .
wow .
but josh is good too .
yeah josh is very good .
and .
okay so you actually have the advantage of double support .
do you know why joshua referred you to sound versus here .
here .
um-hum .
yes .
yes uh-huh .
yeah .
.
no but did so you &apos;re in good hands with sound .
it &apos;s just that like the psychiatry department here is more a consultation basis to see what your needs are .
and then as joshua did referral .
they don &apos;t have the capacity to do it ongoing .
so you &apos;re in good hands with sound .
oh i &apos;m glad you hooked up i mean yeah .
you went down the right channel .
have you .
g a u .
okay oh it &apos;s open now .
okay .
okay .
ah .
okay .
so have you started with sound yet .
no .
okay .
okay .
excellent .
uh-huh .
okay okay .
does it work for you .
okay .
okay .
and .
what kept you from continuing to get the zoloft .
oh okay .
okay yeah .
you just stopped going .
oh .
oh yeah .
you &apos;re on the right track .
that &apos;s great .
no no i .
that &apos;s great .
okay .
okay so you &apos;re in a good place .
you &apos;re in a good place right now it sounds like .
it was very very fortunate that you hooked up on rehab and joshua and now sound and things kind of fell into place for you .
oh okay okay .
and that &apos;s helped so your spirituality .
helpful .
okay .
yeah .
aw .
oh but it did eventually .
so tell me is there anything else that you &apos;ve been thinking about that might be helpful to you .
or is there anything else that you &apos;ve already tried .
housing .
mm .
so you &apos;re staying in shelters .
you have income though don &apos;t you .
yeah because of your j .
you have j a x right .
is that what you were trying to .
because you went from g g a u to j a x .
all right .
okay okay .
um-hum .
um-hum .
okay .
okay .
.
okay .
and they don &apos;t like it .
okay .
so have you looked into that at all .
have friends been able to help you .
are you interested in that .
have you looked into it at all .
ah okay .
okay it &apos;s cooper house though .
yeah .
so the housing would be a big part of this for you .
i mean you &apos;ve done already but housing would just be like the would be the coup de gras as they say .
well you know if you &apos;d like i mean you &apos;re in this clinic now adult medicine .
the social workers here can help you with that .
because we know you know housing is just one of the few things the social workers deal with .
um what i could do is i had mentioned earlier that i was helping one of my staff out .
i could take well i have your name .
and your hospital number and i would make a referral to him .
to set up an appointment slot .
and so you guys could engage in that regard and he could totally help you .
do you have .
oh you don &apos;t have a contact phone because joey took that down from you right .
because i agree housing is huge .
it &apos;s just huge .
okay .
okay yeah and two things right there .
yeah yeah yeah exactly .
oh yeah .
do you do you have to leave during the day .
and you do still huh .
i thought i was thinking the women had the opportunity to stay .
are you at angeline &apos;s .
uh-huh .
okay .
yeah .
all that just makes it difficult .
oh my gosh .
so where would you go tonight jana .
have you okay .
and that &apos;s what you were just talking about the fact that you need housing .
to get away from that .
yeah .
okay .
yeah .
yeah .
you &apos;ve definitely reached that point where it &apos;s enough is enough you know .
so when you pursue housing do you need to have your fiance with you .
oh you don &apos;t .
no okay .
okay .
so yeah .
so if you &apos;d like we can put you you know we can pursue housing in that regard .
and there might be something else you know along the lines of cooper house .
i &apos;m not actually familiar with cooper house myself .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a transitional setting or a .
is it a .
it is it is transitional .
okay well .
but you can get in sooner .
yeah .
good okay .
see you &apos;ve got you &apos;ve been you &apos;ve been envisioning things jana haven &apos;t you .
you kind of look and you kind of see where you are in but it has the future .
yeah yeah .
but imagine where you head would be if you didn &apos;t have these things that were pursuing .
it would be empty because those are the that &apos;s huge that .
okay .
so you &apos;ve made that decision .
you &apos;ve made the decision this is it .
that &apos;s great .
so housing .
your mental health follow-up .
anything else anything else you &apos;ve thought about or you think might be helpful .
or that might be helpful to talk about .
transportation .
okay .
yeah .
yeah .
they &apos;re gone .
um-hum .
and all gone .
yeah that &apos;s hard .
yeah yeah .
your own stuff .
especially when you have to keep it near you and that &apos;s what you you know you don &apos;t have a regular place .
mm .
but you &apos;re taking this pretty sequentially .
you got the mental health follow-up housing transportation .
you &apos;re actually on a nice track .
okay .
keep going .
keep on going .
okay .
excellent .
in the way .
you don &apos;t wanna be .
so you have you met with carol yet today .
you didn &apos;t get to ask her .
oh you did .
wow .
but oh did you see a psychologist yesterday .
oh joshua .
oh i mean you came here .
and then you ended up in a rehab clinic .
well that &apos;s interesting .
oh .
they took you yeah .
okay .
okay .
yeah joshua &apos;s a he &apos;s good though .
he &apos;s a psychologist .
he &apos;s really good .
yeah yeah .
actually you &apos;ve made quite a bit of progress .
good good .
yeah .
unfortunately .
especially out on the street .
um-hum .
yeah .
yeah but no you &apos;re on the right track though it sounds like .
um-hum .
yeah .
oh you &apos;ve been there done that .
okay .
you &apos;ve said that sums it up right there .
i mean it don &apos;t to hear you know listen to counselors even a drug counselor whatever .
.
.
yeah yeah .
there you go yeah .
it sounds like it .
it sounds like you &apos;re doing it it sounds like you have .
um you say you feel better right .
is that physically and emotionally .
okay okay .
really okay .
ah okay so you &apos;re feeling good more in a optimistic sense .
okay oh okay .
good good .
um-hmm .
okay .
yeah .
so those are the two big things .
and it sounds like you &apos;re making it in both regards .
so and with all those yeah and it &apos;s funny how in both ways and both instances you just happened to come upon both of them yeah the cooper house .
because you know someone there .
and then it sounded like help from joshua .
hm .
yeah it sounds like you &apos;ve turned it around .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re blaming yourself now you &apos;re taking charge .
wow .
it &apos;s not easy .
it &apos;s not easy .
you &apos;re to be .
you &apos;re to be proud of yourself you know .
really .
.
really .
really .
so do you have the opportunity to .
are you going to be seeing carol anytime soon again .
oh carol &apos;s not your primary .
yeah .
yeah i don &apos;t see why she couldn &apos;t be .
she sees patients ongoing .
you know we can .
that &apos;s the thing i can ask about that too .
because that &apos;s a .
yeah .
really .
so you don &apos;t have a p c p right now .
oh so they &apos;re already in the process of assigning you yeah yeah .
i &apos;m not sure why carol couldn &apos;t be your p c p .
yeah .
well she can &apos;t but she can do it under the guidance of her attending .
people do see them the nurse practitioners on an ongoing basis here because just .
yeah .
hm .
that could be it .
it could be for new patients they have to see an attending .
okay .
okay .
okay .
so do you have the slip from yesterday saying that they were gonna set you up .
okay .
okay so you will get a p c p it sounds like .
yeah .
no it would be here .
it would be here .
um because you let &apos;s see you came in had your walk-in .
was it a walk-in appointment yesterday or .
you scheduled an appointment but you hadn &apos;t established a p c p and that &apos;s what they &apos;re looking to do .
okay .
yeah .
exactly .
you do have to have a primary doc .
.
mm .
just yeah yeah .
mm .
yeah .
.
yeah .
yeah .
so who did you see today jana .
oh that &apos;s right because joe talked to you yesterday and asked you to come back .
okay .
i &apos;m going to put this on pause .
okay so it looks like you &apos;re going to be set up next week .
um .
oh definitely .
definitely so as a kind follow-up what i &apos;d like to do jana is say follow-up with you in a week .
to see how housing is going to see about the meeting with the social worker .
again to see if happens before or after a week .
i &apos;d like to personally follow-up with you in a week to see how things are going .
you know for this study .
because joey is going to follow-up with you ongoing .
right we told you that .
over the course of the next year .
i &apos;d like to follow-up with you in a week to see how housing and the mental health follow-up .
that &apos;s great that you already have an appointment next week .
actually when is the tenth .
um today is the second .
so the tenth would be next wednesday .
so why don &apos;t i follow-up with you next thursday .
is that okay .
and then like in the meantime though i &apos;ll have you hook up with social worker for the housing piece if you can .
are you pretty free to come back anytime .
okay let &apos;s do that okay .
so that works for you huh .
and we have a good number for you .
right okay .
so .
excellent .
well i appreciate this jana .
okay .
yeah this is very helpful .
and like i said it would be helpful for me to be able to follow-up with you too .
and i hope it &apos;s helpful for you .
okay thanks so much .
for thirty eighth .
and it &apos;s cool it &apos;s little i kinda like that .
so again thank you for talking with joey .
i guess he told you about the study .
and i guess from the questions he asked you he scores it .
and this is for you to keep .
it &apos;s based on the dast .
did he tell you a little bit about the dast .
the drug and alcohol and risk .
because it &apos;s based on you know what how much you &apos;re using and what your risks are to your living situation to your medical health and some of the stresses that drug use may be causing .
so that &apos;s how they kind of figure it out .
so does this surprise you at all or .
hmm why can you tell me a little bit about that or .
you don &apos;t think you &apos;re a hard-core drug person .
okay tell me who is a hard-core drug person .
what would make somebody .
mm .
uh-huh uh-huh .
the means being .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so you don &apos;t ever have to do that .
okay so tell me about how you use drugs .
hmm .
if it &apos;s available .
yeah .
you don &apos;t go looking for it so just if it &apos;s available .
so are you able to get drugs for free from people that you know .
okay they &apos;re pretty .
yeah i would think that it might be a little hard to have that happen a lot .
uh-huh so you never have to seek out any drugs they just happen to be around .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
and .
uh-huh .
so when you do have money though it sounds like there might be some times that you might .
you don &apos;t seek it .
okay well tell me about when why you don &apos;t do that anymore .
well .
you said you have been a person that sought drugs in the past .
is that .
&apos; cause you said you don &apos;t you used to do that .
okay .
uh huh .
okay so what changed .
what made that happen .
doctor &apos;s advice .
so your doctor .
uh-huh so which drugs have you cut back on .
the cocaine yeah that will definitely make you race your heart .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
what &apos;s good for your pain the .
marijuana so you sometimes use marijuana for pain .
who suggested .
the doctor .
the doctor suggested that you use marijuana for pain .
oh okay what did you think of that advice .
and so are you doing that for your back pain .
oh .
bless you .
okay so you don &apos;t use the marijuana or you .
okay .
yeah well marijuana has it &apos;s own set of side effects also you know .
so it sounds like you &apos;ve cut back on the cocaine though because it .
because of medical advice .
was that difficult for you .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
well then and are you happy with that .
good good .
well some .
well some people say that you know they will always miss something .
they &apos;ll remember whatever their benefit physical or psychological from the .
but you feel like you &apos;re not missing it and it sounds like you have more important things your apartment your health .
uh-huh .
so social .
so in a social situation .
even when you have the apartment .
would you have people over to your apartment to do that .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay so having your own housing has reduced what you &apos;ve used .
so it could be a tempting thing when you &apos;re out on the street and homeless .
mm .
you say that there &apos;s been a few times though that you &apos;ve taken it to the apartment .
okay so but there &apos;s been times that you &apos;ve had the .
and what &apos;s going on then .
what happens at that point .
okay so if you &apos;re with somebody you share some drugs with them .
what do you mean trigger .
okay so it sounds like you have dates where it isn &apos;t there .
um-hum yeah so it &apos;s important that this not be a necessity to you .
mm-hmm .
is there ever a time it does feel .
uh-huh .
okay so when you &apos;re feeling low when you &apos;re feeling depressed is there something going on .
or are you just feeling bad about yourself .
does that are you feeling depressed now that you have housing .
okay .
okay .
mm-hmm .
playing on the computer or working on the computer yeah a lot of time can go by when you &apos;re on the computer right yeah yeah .
but when you have a date that doesn &apos;t sound like that would be too depressing .
okay so there are times when you .
mm-hmm .
um-hum um-hum .
what is it like when you decide to have some drugs other than the date and .
what sort of situations .
uh huh .
you participate .
how do you feel when you do that .
do you feel badly about that .
or is that okay with you .
you don &apos;t assess it like that .
how do you assess it then .
it &apos;s just part of your social .
is that anything you want to change .
or you &apos;re okay with that social moment or .
do you ever see a time where you just would cut it off .
yeah so you &apos;ve really sounds like you &apos;ve really reduced what you use it &apos;s been worse .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm-hmm .
right .
uh-huh .
yeah yeah so you don &apos;t see future social &apos; cause it sounds like you don &apos;t go out and seek it you just have social situations where somebody might come by or you have a date .
so you &apos;ve been saying no more .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
so that must make you feel good that you &apos;re able just to kind of tell somebody no when they &apos;re trying to get some group together .
so it sounds has there been a reduction in people calling you about it .
uh huh yeah so now that you &apos;re not actively participating it sounds like it &apos;s sort of a date and you &apos;re not feeling this depressed it feels like it &apos;s .
no .
okay .
well sometimes when you invite somebody over for the date that &apos;s the expectation that part of their evening out is to have some cocaine .
okay .
.
okay .
um-hum um-hum so you &apos;re cutting back it sounds like .
but if it &apos;s not true i don &apos;t want to say that .
you would say you &apos;ve cut way back .
and then i guess getting back to the question i asked .
is do you see a time when you just won &apos;t use it at all .
you do see a time .
okay .
what would be happening in your life if that were to happen .
okay .
yeah .
would you have to make any changes to make that .
okay if you were to swear against it would .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay if it became troubling what .
well again .
so it was troubling before .
it was a troubling situation .
but the cutting back you &apos;ve done on your own and some of it .
okay all right well that &apos;s good that &apos;s i &apos;m really glad .
so one of the things a part of this study is i &apos;m gonna probably call you up and just kind of see where you are in a couple weeks .
i will be calling you up .
but they &apos;re gonna probably call you up in about six months .
and they have different time frames three months six months .
but i &apos;m just just to follow up on our conversation now just see how .
it is only gonna take about five minutes max probably just to see what you &apos;re thinking about if you &apos;ve made any more changes .
and you know and then they &apos;ll continue you on in the study and just kind of monitor where you are .
okay do you have any questions .
okay good good so these papers are for you to keep .
and then here &apos;s your gift certificate .
and it &apos;s good at both the fred meyer and the qfcs .
yeah i &apos;m gonna stop this .
okay i think it &apos;s recording now .
okay i &apos;m not sure how much you know about what we &apos;re doing here .
okay first i want to thank you for agreeing to participate in this .
and it helps this is a research program .
this is not a time where i &apos;m gonna say you know stop doing anything .
it &apos;s a conversation about drugs and how the impact .
so you answered some questions and i was just wondering if you wanted to know what your score was .
what do you think it was .
yeah okay from one to ten what do you think it was .
five okay .
&apos; cause the score &apos;s gonna range between zero and ten .
um yours was eight .
well it means let me show you what it means .
that &apos;s a good question .
eight see this little triangle here .
so eight is severe risk .
and this is called the dast drug abuse screening test .
and it &apos;s been used to kind of measure to see the impact of drugs and how that affects people &apos;s lives .
so that &apos;s .
mm-hmm .
oh wow .
yeah .
uh huh .
mm-hmm .
yeah so you were able to function but and get some things done .
really so you just had this whole secret sounds like .
wow .
uh-huh .
wow .
wouldn &apos;t affect your job or anything .
wow so it sounds like it kind of didn &apos;t get in the way at all .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
it didn &apos;t do that for you .
i see .
uh huh .
so why are you changing .
because now i &apos;m hearing you you really want to change it .
oh it &apos;s doing the opposite then .
uh huh .
uh huh .
uh huh .
so for a long time it served a function .
and how long would you say that was .
so ten years it was functional it worked for you nobody knew but your whole thing .
oh so you &apos;re saying things have changed now in the last eight months .
emotionally .
with friends family .
you have kids and .
oh boy .
your relationships have really shifted .
wow .
um-hum .
mm-hmm .
uh huh .
nonfunctional .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
i &apos;m hearing that like to look back at that since what 81 .
is that when you started using drugs .
and like you can clearly look back and say okay this time this really didn &apos;t interfere with who i am you know how i see myself being producting being a mom being a grandma or whatever .
and i don &apos;t think you were a grandma in 81 .
not in 81 .
okay all right .
okay okay but then you can look back and you can see okay clearly that you know it started i &apos;m hearing most of your relationships .
and those are important to you .
yeah .
you love your family .
wow .
wow .
so doing drugs .
mm-hmm .
oh wow .
your what .
oh you got off your pity pot okay .
how &apos;d you do that .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
oh man .
yes you had a big wake-up call and you &apos;re like oh pity party &apos;s over you know .
go .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
i &apos;m hearing that you &apos;re really committed to you know you have a plan this next week you &apos;re going into treatment .
you got a bed date or .
really where you going .
this is really important to make this change .
yeah .
no no you &apos;re really clear it &apos;s about you and your family .
you and your family .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
i mean it &apos;s important for you to take care of yourself you like to dress nice you like you know taking care of yourself and that that &apos;s part of who you are this other piece just doesn &apos;t fit in there .
yeah .
yeah yeah .
oh yeah yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah huh .
would not are not people .
so if there weren &apos;t drugs .
you wouldn &apos;t be drinking coffee and you know talking about .
mm .
mmmm .
yeah i hear you .
no you &apos;re .
uh-huh .
and that goes partly with crack .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
it &apos;s really important .
for you to make this change .
how confident are you that you can make it .
six being that you can complete this .
to maintain .
why isn &apos;t it like lower like a three or a two .
mm .
mm-hum .
mm-hm .
so you &apos;re really focused you &apos;re really determined .
you &apos;ve been there you know where you slipped the last time it &apos;s different this time .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
thinking about it .
so this is different now because it sounds like you really know mentally what goes through your head too in relapse .
the drama .
yeah yeah well you know i mean there &apos;s yeah geez .
yeah .
not just draining and then there &apos;s the feed .
and this is where i kind of just want to tell you what i think i &apos;m hearing .
can i tell you .
um i think that the reasons for making this change are you don &apos;t see yourself as and it &apos;s not in a negative way because they &apos;re people they &apos;re human beings on the street but you don &apos;t have the same kind of drive as they do or a different way of being that they do you &apos;re different from that you haven &apos;t .
right .
right you have a family you have children grandchildren .
right .
yeah .
so there &apos;s you know a lot of reasons you know the street life your family and then yourself just that you are you don &apos;t see yourself as being addicted to these drugs and having that be your focus .
mm-hmm .
um-hum .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
no so it &apos;s really changed .
yeah .
yeah .
uh huh .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
well i think you can do it .
i mean i really came in here with that you got the glow you got the drive and you &apos;re focused and you &apos;re ready to do it .
and you know i really appreciate you being so honest about what this has been like for you .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
i really appreciate it .
you &apos;re funny .
okay well here &apos;s this gift card .
i &apos;m not really sure .
i think it &apos;s all i can &apos;t read that .
i know that it &apos;s local .
there &apos;s local on there .
looks like there &apos;s .
thank you .
um oh that &apos;s fred meyer .
ask .
yeah i mean she &apos;s the one that gave it to me so .
i don &apos;t know if she &apos;s still downstairs .
yeah .
sure .
you know i &apos;m gonna give you this .
even though it sounds like you &apos;re pretty pretty well know what you &apos;re doing .
but there &apos;s some other resources that maybe you want to share it with somebody else you know might be interested in that .
here we go .
what &apos;s that .
a soundboard .
what &apos;s that .
oh really .
you learn something new .
what &apos;s that .
oh crank calls .
uh huh .
no i &apos;ve heard of lightboards storyboards .
here i &apos;m gonna have to move this up you &apos;ve got a quiet voice .
so you &apos;re named earl .
hi i &apos;m charla .
charla yeah .
so thanks for coming in today .
i understand you were here yesterday .
and that you answered a bunch of questions .
remember that .
okay and they &apos;re research questions we &apos;re trying to figure out see if certain techniques work .
and so you answered some questions yesterday that was scored .
are you interested in what the number was .
really okay well i &apos;ll help you do it .
yeah i &apos;ll help you .
okay so you answered some questions and scored between i think zero and ten .
and there &apos;s a number and the number is associated with let me show you without giving it all away .
it &apos;s this triangle so here &apos;s this is zero area and this has to do with use .
and then it &apos;s going up to more and more severe use .
so what number do you think you had .
uh-huh .
right on .
did you see the number .
okay okay okay so four means you &apos;re right here moderate risk .
what do you think about that .
well that &apos;s a good question .
moderate risk means let &apos;s see no risk how much harm does your drug use expose you to .
the level of drug use that you &apos;re currently using .
does that makes sense .
and it says here alcohol marijuana .
is that it .
what &apos;s artificial marijuana .
the sting .
what is this .
is it incense .
what do you do with it .
do you smoke it or .
this is not for human consumption .
what &apos;s that .
yeah it does say that you &apos;re saying .
yeah okay are you afraid that that might hurt your brain somehow .
no okay so it sounds like you think that &apos;s pretty safe stuff is what you &apos;re saying .
probably not .
okay so sounds like you are level four of risk .
what do you think about that .
sabotaging who .
what &apos;s that .
yeah yeah .
mmmm okay between zero and ten and you &apos;re at a four .
and as far as you know sort of the amount of risk moderate risk .
that you have and you think and i &apos;m hearing you say that it might be sort of so the concern might be sabotage .
yeah well you have yeah .
from zero to ten you &apos;ve got a risk factor of four which .
would put you in the moderate risk range that the amount of harm that you &apos;re doing is like moderate risk .
okay .
okay so moderate risk means what harm that the drug does to you does to .
somebody it could mean a lot of different things like socially homelessness poor relationships health jail .
what &apos;s that .
what no you wanted me to explain what the harm is you know what the harm .
yeah and then so i &apos;m hearing you say that your level of risk is not are you concerned about it or not .
i &apos;m not quite sure .
can you explain that .
okay it sounds like okay so how important is it for you to change any of your drug use .
say again from one to ten ten being really important to change and one being not at all .
six why isn &apos;t it lower .
okay just asking .
okay okay so between one and ten you &apos;re at a six .
and ten being that it &apos;s important to change .
okay and you &apos;re saying you have reasons but you don &apos;t want to say what they are .
okay how confident is it for you to make that change again from zero or one to ten .
six okay so you feel pretty confident .
okay why didn &apos;t you give yourself a lower number .
um-hum .
so i &apos;m hearing you say that there &apos;s a lot of you &apos;re thinking about joy and pain .
feeling pretty sad .
occasionally .
so on a scale again from one to ten being say happy is ten sad is one where are you right now .
so pretty happy .
okay and so i &apos;m hearing you say that it sounds like you do you smoke marijuana or you drink alcohol pretty much daily .
um-hum and that you see it as a moderate risk .
sort of .
you &apos;re not really quite sure what that means .
but you &apos;re also talking about that you &apos;re it &apos;s important for you to change this and you &apos;re pretty confident that you can do it you &apos;re pretty high up there .
okay .
so you &apos;ve done it before you &apos;ve been successful in the past in making that change and you know it sort of seems like it &apos;s something you could do if you want to do it but right now you &apos;re just not really thinking about if that &apos;s something you want to do .
i want to go back to something else you said earlier about a pitiful life .
now how does the marijuana alcohol use tie into pitiful life .
did you have a pitiful life when you were clean before .
&apos; cause that &apos;s your terms not my terms those are your words .
well yeah you had said that you had a period of your life when you were clean and sober .
yeah when you weren &apos;t using the stuff on a daily basis maybe you cut down .
i &apos;m not sure .
but you said that you had done it before and you &apos;re pretty confident you can do it again .
and you also said something about about pitiful life .
and so i wasn &apos;t sure how much of the use is tied into this idea that you have a pitiful life .
&apos; cause this is pretty strong language .
what &apos;s that .
about what .
okay well you know you have different options of what you could do .
you can cut down your drinking or your marijuana use .
you could cut out both of them the marijuana and alcohol .
you could choose to not do anything where you &apos;re gonna get in trouble .
you know for instance some people say you know i &apos;m gonna continue drinking but i &apos;m not gonna drive or i &apos;m not gonna or i &apos;m gonna continue using drugs but i &apos;m not gonna drive and i &apos;m not going to go to this one neighborhood where i know it &apos;s not safe because i want to have all my functioning .
no but you know like doing things that might be unsafe like limiting marijuana use or alcohol use to where you feel you won &apos;t get hurt .
okay so but these are options for change that if you choose to you know and you could just leave it as it is do nothing .
or you can also get some help to help you with change .
and that &apos;s through you know there &apos;s aa na different treatment groups .
okay so what i &apos;m hearing you say .
can i tell you what i &apos;m hearing .
sure .
okay i &apos;ve heard you say that you drink and you smoke marijuana kind of on a daily basis .
pretty much you have selected placed where you feel safe and that &apos;s important for you you .
but it &apos;s on your mind it &apos;s something you &apos;re thinking about .
and you feel really if you want to make a change you could do it you &apos;re pretty high up there .
you &apos;re pretty confident you could do it you &apos;ve done it in the past .
um is there anything else i could add to that .
what i thought i heard you say .
i &apos;m just reflecting what you said .
okay okay okay well here &apos;s you know you have some resources substance abuse resources if you &apos;d like to look at .
mm-hmm .
okay .
okay .
what &apos;s that .
all right well some people find that helpful .
i &apos;m hearing you know that you &apos;ve you &apos;re sort of thinking about things about making changes but you &apos;re not ready to make any changes yet .
and i think you can do it .
because you &apos;ve done it in the past .
and if that &apos;s something you want to do you can do it .
and i really appreciated your honesty and for participating in this research project .
thank you all right that &apos;s it .
where you from .
really .
how long have you been up here .
what brought you up here .
is it working .
still in the middle stages of your experiment .
okay .
all right i wish you all the best .
okay take care .
okay i &apos;ll put that here .
and so it looks like maybe they &apos;re here to meet you right now .
it &apos;s alright we just started so .
okay so room thirteen .
alright so yeah this is not to be getting in the way of your appointment with your doctor and as soon as you &apos;re ready i &apos;ll get you there so you won &apos;t miss it definitely .
and so what i &apos;d like to do now is kind of continue the conversation with you about some of the things that you and joey had i guess talked about or some of the things that you had filled out in those questionnaires if that &apos;s okay with you .
okay so i &apos;d like to i guess ask you talk a little bit more with me about your drug use .
and how you feel that &apos;s going .
and how that &apos;s impacting your life .
and what your thoughts are about .
mh-hm .
yeah .
alright .
okay so you use no other drugs besides marijuana and you &apos;re pretty happy with that it sounds like .
okay tell me what you like about it .
mm-hmm .
so marijuana helps with your appetite sounds like it helps with your mood it doesn &apos;t seem to affect your sleeping .
helps you sleep .
right of are there any side effects are there any negative things smoking marijuana that you can think of .
okay what kind of job was it .
mm oh yeah uh-huh .
uh-huh .
okay .
so they drug tested you and you were positive for marijuana .
really okay .
right .
okay .
so they offered you .
to keep your job but you said not if it means i have to stop smoking .
alright so .
uh-huh .
right .
so you liked that job .
mm-hmm .
right .
so you went .
to school and you were trained as a forklift driver you got a good job good paying job and they started drug testing you you were positive and you lost your job so it sounds like what you &apos;re saying it &apos;s maybe more important to you to smoke marijuana than it is to keep this job that you were trained for .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
it &apos;s an important part of your life .
uh-huh .
they don &apos;t drug test .
okay .
and are you happy .
you &apos;re you &apos;re happy with working in a restaurant .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
it &apos;s really a part of how you see yourself .
okay .
no .
mm-hmm .
okay .
you feel like you want to do that yeah .
yeah .
right .
uh-huh .
yeah .
okay .
so the best thing would be is if you could continue your job at driving the forklift and not get drug tested that would be the best thing .
what you were doing for a long time .
yeah .
yeah .
so there are some of these new laws these new rules have really sounds like been a problem for your lifestyle .
right .
yeah .
i understand that .
that &apos;s difficult .
because on the one hand it &apos;s part of your lifestyle and the other hand it &apos;s costing you this livelihood that you have had and had had .
how do you feel about that .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
so do you feel like you &apos;re being labeled as a pot smoker and that &apos;s a bad thing where you &apos;re not thinking that it &apos;s a bad thing at all because it &apos;s so helpful for you .
yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
.
and is there anything else that you can think of that has been not so good about smoking marijuana .
that &apos;s it .
mm-hmm .
and so you &apos;ve decided that you &apos;re okay with making that sacrifice at least as much as you can do because it &apos;s a legal thing yeah alright .
so i appreciate you talking to me about that .
and i &apos;m certainly not trying to make any kind of judgment about what your choices are .
um .
i wanted to ask if you &apos;re interested in hearing the results of one of the tests that you took one of the screening tests that you took .
it &apos;s called the drug abuse screening test .
and it rates people &apos;s level of risk from drug use on a scale from zero to ten with ten being severe risk and zero being absolutely no risk .
and this is a questionnaire that was given to a whole bunch of people and it &apos;s supposed to rate how much risk you may have in terms of your drug use .
and risk means risk for health problems risk for financial problems risk for legal problems .
so in terms of how you answered or how you perceive or how you see your level of risk as it pertains to your drug use where do you think you would score on a scale of zero which means no risk and ten which is severe risk .
yeah what do you think .
uh-huh .
no risk .
if you think about it in terms of legal risk risk from the legal system risk for financial problems risk for health problems what kind of risk do you think you might .
yeah so there is a health risk component .
yeah .
what &apos;s the health risk .
okay so the health risk to marijuana is overeating .
okay .
yeah .
okay .
and you &apos;re anxious to see your provider about that .
mm-hmm .
you &apos;re fine .
okay alright .
so can you think of a level of risk that you may perceive yourself at from marijuana smoking just in terms of health or finances or legal or any .
yeah .
right .
right so there &apos;s a little bit of risk there .
so .
and if you &apos;re interested to see how the screening test scored you .
it has you at a number two which is some risk .
so that sounds pretty accurate .
it &apos;s a little bit of risk well the bad or good is it sort of depends on how you perceive it .
it &apos;s some .
yeah some risk that &apos;s low it &apos;s not no risk .
but you &apos;ve identified some of the risks that you &apos;re taking by smoking marijuana and it sounds like you &apos;re okay with taking those risks .
as far as you can be i mean .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
right .
what would have to go bad for you to maybe think about wanting to make a change .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
so if restaurant companies started drug testing that might be a reason for you to say i need to change my lifestyle .
yeah .
mm do you think you could do that if it came to that .
or how confident are you that you could make that change .
right .
right .
right .
on a scale of one to ten with zero being not at all confident and ten being the most confident how confident are you that you could make that change if you had to .
yeah yeah .
i hear that .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
eight that &apos;s pretty .
you &apos;re pretty confident yeah .
mm-hmm .
right .
yeah .
right .
so you &apos;re confident you could change you don &apos;t want to change and that &apos;s important to yeah .
yeah .
right .
have you ever thought about what it would take to quit or what you would have to do .
or what have you what have you thought about in terms of that .
right .
okay .
sounds like it it sounds like you &apos;re a survivor you .
mm-hmm .
that &apos;s alright .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
alright well i don &apos;t want to keep you because i know your appointment with dan is coming up so .
the next step of this would be i &apos;m hoping that we can call and talk again in a week just on the phone briefly .
is that .
is that alright .
after three .
what &apos;s .
your phone number .
okay i will call you in a week .
is that alright .
okay well i appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about this .
um .
this is for you .
yeah it &apos;s a gift card for any of those grocery stores on the back yeah .
okay so we have the recorder .
on and like i mentioned i am social worker in clinic .
my name is lauren .
and to speak with you today i want to make sure that we get your consent to record our conversation .
so how do you feel about it being recorded .
it &apos;s okay with you okay .
what brings you in to clinic today .
mm-hmm .
okay naomi was telling me that you &apos;re recovering from surgery .
goodness .
wow .
is there an explanation as to the cause of it .
mm .
okay .
yeah how would you feel about talking a little bit more about your i v drug use .
okay kinda let you start .
and tell me a little bit about your experience .
that &apos;s really why we &apos;re here .
i &apos;m not here to .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm is this your first time experiencing some medical complications from your use .
going on .
this is kind of the final straw it sounds like .
yeah any benefits to using anymore .
how is that a benefit .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
no .
benefit anymore .
and what in your mind are the benefits to changing how you &apos;re using so either cutting back or .
or quitting .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so it sounds like the only option is to quit and quit once and for all and be done with it or else or else i mean there &apos;s really no other no other avenue from what i &apos;m hearing right .
and it sounds like you &apos;ve maybe made some attempts in the past to get clean you mentioned that you .
did you go to treatment or .
yeah are there any differences between then and now .
and what are those .
mm-hmm .
and it sounds like now it &apos;s for your own personal .
yeah it &apos;s for you it &apos;s for your livelihood it &apos;s for your well-being sounds like it &apos;s also for your health because it &apos;s been pretty compromised .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so what is it going to take .
don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s fair oftentimes we don &apos;t know .
naomi was telling me a little bit and i was reading here when i came in that you &apos;ve been using methodone you &apos;ve been prescribed methodone for pain it sounds like .
are you getting any other benefit from that as far as .
yeah .
mm .
mm-hmm .
yeah i imagine that &apos;s quite difficult .
kind of that idea of going out and seeking or .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so it sounds like maybe one of the biggest barriers is breaking free from that social group .
and those phone calls and those friends and .
yeah .
fantastic .
mm-hmm yeah it &apos;s a change it &apos;s a big change .
it sounds like you definitely have the support behind you it &apos;s just a matter of making the commitment .
well what i can share with you today if you &apos;d like is the results of our study and some of the paperwork that you filled out .
what were your thoughts .
before we jump into that .
when you were completing everything what were you feeling .
what were you thinking .
okay .
okay understandable .
so what we do is based on your responses from the study we come up with a score .
it &apos;s called a dast score it &apos;s a drug abuse screening test score .
and we think of this scale as like a richter scale so the disparity is pretty high between no risk to severe risk .
and let me share real quick if you would like where your score fell .
based on what you endorsed you were in the high severe risk category or high danger to drug use .
and so what this means is that you may have medical injuries you may have mental or emotional consequences from your use .
and these are things that we &apos;ve already talked about .
and so oftentimes what we look for what we advise folks in these categories to do is to cut back in some way like we &apos;ve already talked about .
or kind of look at their use and how they can change it quitting or even staying the same if that &apos;s something that they prefer to do .
looking at this does this change anything .
yeah .
it just reinforces your feelings .
okay well we have a couple options that i can offer you from at least my standpoint .
and one it sounds like the methodone is like you mentioned helpful with kind of curbing that .
mm-hmm .
excellent .
okay so you already have that in the works it sounds like .
great .
i do have a list of resources for treatment too .
is that something you &apos;d be interested in .
okay so harborview actually offers a fantastic program addictions program if you &apos;re interested in coming .
to harborview .
mm-hmm .
excuse me .
so the number for harborview of course is here it &apos;s seven seven four ninety six hundred .
and they have outpatient program it &apos;s about eight weeks it &apos;s pretty intense .
you &apos;re gonna meet three hours three times a week .
i &apos;ve heard great things about it .
then there &apos;s some other options throughout king county .
is that where .
are you in king county or are you outside of the area .
okay .
go ahead and take that and .
are you familiar with any of those programs .
and how do you feel about calling and following up .
okay .
okay because one of the other things if you feel a little uncertain is to speak with a social worker that you &apos;ve been in contact with .
and i &apos;m sure they would be happy to assist you as well .
perfect .
excellent excellent .
and how would you feel if i gave you a call in a couple weeks or so and follow up with you .
okay wonderful well thank you for sharing your story with me .
i appreciate it .
and is there anything that i can help you with .
do you need help getting downstairs or .
you do okay .
okay .
oo .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
sure let me speak with the front desk and see if we can get somebody from transport to give you a lift .
down there okay .
alright it was really nice to meet you .
and here are your gift cards .
naomi said that you wanted a few different types so .
they &apos;re all there for you okay .
you &apos;re welcome .
all right so as i mentioned this is just gonna be a really brief conversation about one of the measures you filled out .
and then also a little bit about drug use and whether or not you feel like that &apos;s been impacting your life at all so .
so do you have any questions for me before we get started or .
okay and how was it kind of filling out the interviews yesterday .
didn &apos;t take too long .
okay great well one of the many papers that you filled out was called the d a s which is a drug abuse screening test .
and would it be okay with you if i go over the results with you really quickly .
okay so we have this handy little visual right here .
so basically all of the scores are on a zero to ten scale .
and it looks like according to this that you actually scored a nine .
which would be a little bit more on the severe risk scale .
so how do you feel about that .
what do you think .
okay .
okay could you tell me a little bit more about that .
severe risk could be anything it could be health problems .
it could be something like drinking and driving .
i mean a little bit more severe risk to your health or to your person so .
okay .
okay .
all right and it looks like that you had mentioned here that in the past month you had done cocaine marijuana and alcohol .
okay so yeah can you tell me a little bit more about sorta your reaction to looking at this and what you think .
okay .
could you tell me a little bit more about that .
mm-hmm .
oh okay .
oh .
hm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay so when did you get clean off of that .
well congratulations that &apos;s impressive .
what are some of the things that you like about cocaine .
so the cocaine kinda helps you feel a little bit better .
sort of helps forget some of the things that you were talking about .
okay have you ever taken any medication for depression before or .
and so are there any other things that you &apos;ve found that you have liked about using cocaine .
hm .
and from what you would say were saying though that you &apos;ve also been using pretty heavily for almost a year so .
mm-hmm .
hm .
mm-hmm so whereas once before it was more fun and recreational now it &apos;s something that you &apos;re having a hard time knowing any other way to sort of .
yeah .
okay well so you had mentioned quitting heroine .
have you ever tried to quit coke before .
mm-hmm .
do you have a lot of friends or a lot of people that you know that use pretty heavily .
so it sounds like also kind of being in that environment of pretty heavy using as well might make it difficult .
and so even though i mean you had said that you weren &apos;t using heroine for too long .
i mean i still think it &apos;s really awesome that you were able to quit .
were there some what were some of the things that you were able to do to help you quit .
mm-hmm .
so it &apos;s pretty much out of your system for good the real craving .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
and so are you currently working right now .
or you had said you &apos;re at a respite home .
okay .
for the past three days .
okay .
prior to that were you working or .
okay .
oh .
okay .
hm .
yeah depression can be really difficult .
so you had mentioned obviously that you feel like there really isn &apos;t anything good about or any benefits that you &apos;ve seen in your life from drug use you had mentioned .
hm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
and when you say take a hit do you mean cocaine or marijuana .
cocaine .
crack .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm and so it &apos;s it sounds like what you &apos;re saying is that you &apos;ve seen the cost to your health and obviously the financial aspect you had mentioned really briefly and even though there is that benefit of it sort of in the moment feeling a little bit better that the long-term consequences sort of outweigh that much more .
so at this point if you had to put it on like a one to ten scale how important would it be for you right now do you think to .
yeah .
yes .
i should have told you that .
okay .
mm-hmm .
that &apos;s great .
how has it felt for the past three days being clean so far .
mm-hmm .
that &apos;s awesome .
and have you talked to them at the respite center about when you leave kinda seeing about treatment options or .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
hm .
mm-hmm it makes a lot of sense because it sounds like maybe getting your health back first and then being able to check in with them and .
so similar question on a one to ten scale if you had to rate how confident you are right now about being able to quit what number would you give it .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah well i mean that shows the a huge level of self-awareness and self-restraint .
i mean to be able to do that and to to recognize what some triggers might be and be able to kind of stop the triggers in the tracks on your own .
so you &apos;re saying that you &apos;re kind of on that cusp right now of about a five .
and what do you think it would take for you to give it a little bit higher of a number .
.
mm-hmm .
so the longer that you go without having it in your system you &apos;re noticing more clarity .
okay and how long are you gonna be at the respite center for .
oh .
hm .
hm .
and you said this is related to your diabetes .
hm .
and have you had any problems similar to this before in the past or is this .
okay and you had mentioned before that you think there might be also something related to drug use and affecting that as well .
okay .
mm-hmm .
all right well it sounds like you have a lot of clarity a lot of self-awareness .
you &apos;re able to recognize that the short-term consequences ultimately or the short-term doesn &apos;t the pleasure short-term of using ultimately doesn &apos;t necessarily have the benefits of the long-term consequences .
and that you &apos;re at a place right now where you &apos;re able to kind of stay away from it sounds like maybe potential triggers .
and getting healthy which is great .
and again i mean i think it &apos;s really impressive that you were able to quit heroine .
it &apos;s really impressive that you had the wherewithal today to know that you had a little money in your pocket and to kind of stop yourself .
so well did you have any other questions for me or .
okay i mean this is pretty much all it is is just kind of a conversation so .
would it be okay with you if i follow up in a week &apos;s time and give you a call and just kinda check in and see how you &apos;re doing .
and see how you &apos;re feeling about the conversation if anything at all .
okay .
let me see if i can get .
do you have a couple numbers that i can reach you at .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
two six three okay so two zero six three six eight three eight one six .
and .
two zero six two seven one one two six three .
is the first one a .
home okay .
okay but it &apos;s okay to ask for you .
yeah okay .
.
okay .
okay that sounds great .
and i &apos;ll just go ahead and .
okay there we go and excuse me if i check on this every so often to make sure it doesn &apos;t stop on us .
okay so again i appreciate you waiting .
waiting is never fun .
and i &apos;m glad we were able to hook up .
do you have any questions about your little interview with chloe yesterday .
uh-huh .
okay .
okay .
ah .
so money is one consideration huh .
okay so you &apos;re okay with talking to me about those things .
okay so you mentioned it &apos;s about time to quit and the money is a consideration for you .
oh thirty years huh .
it &apos;s getting old for you .
ah .
is it .
really .
good good .
how long has this been now john that you &apos;ve made this little decision and .
consciously .
last two years .
okay .
.
free huh .
it &apos;s hard it &apos;s hard huh .
i mean it &apos;s there and it &apos;s free .
wow .
does that happen often .
yeah yeah .
oh okay .
uh-huh .
could i ask what types of things you &apos;ve been doing to try to cut down as you have the last couple years .
so just out of necessity .
that &apos;s that is important yeah .
is it .
mm .
so yeah .
so out of financial necessity it &apos;s not as if you &apos;re doing anything but it &apos;s just .
really .
really .
wow so you &apos;ve thought about this and you &apos;ve made that choice that it &apos;s time .
um .
mm-hmm .
yeah yeah .
so .
you need to sleep .
yeah .
and that &apos;s not you don &apos;t want to live like that yeah .
so it &apos;s almost not as if you have to do anything in particular to quit it &apos;s kind of like circumstances .
yeah circumstances are happening to you where you do need to quit you feel you need to quit .
okay .
really .
she &apos;s working a lot .
i &apos;ve heard of social security .
oh .
mm .
and she &apos;s with you on this i take it .
yeah .
yeah good good .
it &apos;s a conscious decision like you mentioned we have to make .
and on top of that there &apos;s a lot of factors we don &apos;t have control over that that push that along that you mentioned .
so i wish you well with this and participating in this study .
i hope that we &apos;re able to learn from your experience in the upcoming year .
i hope chloe spoke to you about following up with you in the coming year .
yeah .
oh that tells you something right there .
anything else need to happen for you to be successful in this john .
okay you just mentioned that .
okay .
so you have a teammate you have a teammate too .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
like the marijuana .
yeah yeah .
wow .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah i can see that .
where you can &apos;t move on yeah right .
yeah okay .
you have a lot of compelling reasons john to quit .
there you go .
did do you .
three jobs .
yeah .
really .
oh really .
oh .
wow .
oh .
you gotta .
change yourself .
mm-hmm .
oh okay .
yeah .
it sounds like it .
not using it .
wow .
you &apos;ve told .
.
okay .
and are you still .
yeah .
you spoke volumes .
no you spoke volumes .
and this is exactly i &apos;m looking to learn from you actually and we &apos;re looking to learn from you over the coming year .
it &apos;s just we &apos;re looking to see where you are at this time where you were and where you see yourself in the future .
and you &apos;ve made that very clear mm like i said with very convincing very compelling reasons why you &apos;ve made this decision to change .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for the why &apos;s and the the if &apos;s and the .
yeah .
yeah .
mm .
oh yeah .
uh-huh .
wow .
.
it &apos;s gone .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah you &apos;re more mellow .
okay yeah but now .
but even now though that mellowness is not there &apos;s too many other things that come with it .
so no i can understand so no i can appreciate that so .
i know a lot one week isn &apos;t a lot of time for things to change drastically .
but if you don &apos;t mind i &apos;d like to check in with you in about a week just to follow up on what we talked about today .
and then chloe or jess will follow up with you on a longer term basis like every three months .
it &apos;s a .
grant by the national institute for drug abuse .
yeah i went to u w .
yeah yeah .
yeah .
master of social work uh-huh .
exactly exactly exactly .
i &apos;m actually the supervisor of the clinics here .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
and helping out on this study .
great great .
she she .
she works at it .
she plugs away she cares about the .
yeah .
yeah .
she &apos;s .
she &apos;s very earnest so yeah .
i &apos;ll pass .
that on to her john .
i appreciate that .
they look alike yeah .
and they act alike .
good good .
.
yeah .
yeah .
great .
yeah .
.
that help you .
that &apos;s a good thought .
mm .
yeah .
you made it simple you made life simple .
yeah .
.
oh .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
.
you &apos;re fair game .
ahh .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah you got .
oh .
you did it .
yeah .
you got a lot of life experience john .
you are .
there you go .
see you got the grandchildren too to think about .
excellent .
okay .
uh-huh .
well you &apos;re kinda doing that here right now and i appreciate it .
so i &apos;m gonna flip this off john .
and i &apos;ll just leave this right here .
so my name is matt and i &apos;m a social worker here in the clinic .
and i want to just ask you initially if lea had kinda gave you an idea about what &apos;s gonna happen here between you and i .
okay so yeah if it &apos;s okay with you what i &apos;d like to ask that we talk about is your drug use and how you think that &apos;s going how you think it &apos;s affecting you what &apos;s good about it what &apos;s bad about it .
just kinda want to talk about your impression of how it &apos;s working for you .
and .
okay .
mm-hmm .
what do you mean by that .
so you advise your nephews to to get an education so they can earn money .
right .
that &apos;s .
risky doing that .
yeah .
so your use of recreational drugs is dependent on how much you can afford to spend on it .
so maintaining your job is a priority for you .
so you &apos;re using them and you &apos;re getting a drug screen or having to do a drug screen is a risk yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so it sounds like it &apos;s important to you just to maintain some limits on the amount and how often you &apos;re using because of .
right right .
tell me about your drug use .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
you &apos;re not .
addicted .
mm-hmm .
so if you &apos;re .
if you don &apos;t have the money to purchase it you &apos;re okay with not using .
mm-hmm .
so all of those things are priorities to marijuana to purchasing marijuana .
yeah it looks like you &apos;ve checked a couple other things here like methamphetamines and sedatives .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
sounds like .
you have a risky job .
mm-hmm .
yeah yeah .
it sounds like a .
risky job where you &apos;d wanna be able to have your ability to focus and maintain your judgment yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
yeah .
wow .
yeah .
yeah there are there are some .
some inherent risks .
you have to be careful yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah yeah .
yeah .
it &apos;s got to change your mindset a little bit yeah .
so of these drugs that you &apos;ve identified that you &apos;ve used are any of them or which of them do you find concerning .
are there any that are more concerning than the others or .
oh okay .
oh okay .
mm-hmm .
you .
well you &apos;re concerned about a prescription drug .
but what about these drugs that you &apos;re using recreationally .
mm .
right .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
the seroquel .
oh .
yeah .
this is in jail .
yeah .
were you in jail .
or what do you do in jail .
are you .
okay .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
is that something that happens on a regular basis .
uh-huh .
oh okay .
yeah that &apos;s a big risk .
yeah you don &apos;t .
no .
.
yeah .
so do you currently use methamphetamines .
yeah .
because of money .
so you would if you had the money .
and .
so you .
when you can afford it you use meth .
okay .
and it really you find it that it increases the pleasure .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
so you &apos;ve known people who you feel like have used methamphetamines used meth and have gotten in trouble with it .
yeah you really enjoy the sexual pleasure that you get when using meth .
is there something that you don &apos;t like about it .
or what &apos;s bad about it if anything .
mm-hmm .
okay .
so you &apos;ve .
had some teeth that have decayed .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right so what is sex like without methamphetamines .
so even without .
use you feel like you &apos;re getting some of the effects that you had before .
wow .
right .
well there are some pretty serious pleasurable side effects on the other hand it &apos;s rotting your teeth away and it sounds like because of that you &apos;ve decreased your use .
is that .
so you &apos;ve got these sort of two things here where you like the effects on the other hand you don &apos;t like some of the effects that &apos;s oral .
kind of what do you with that .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
there are health side effects to these drugs yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah you stop taking .
care of yourself so even your teeth are falling out and .
yeah .
mm .
yeah and sounds like you &apos;re well into if you break the law suffer the consequences .
right .
you you know that .
you &apos;re .
uh-huh .
so in some respects it doesn &apos;t sound like it &apos;s worth the tradeoff the pleasure you get versus the consequences .
is it .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
you have higher ambitions than that .
so what do you think you &apos;re gonna do in terms of the meth use .
knowing the tradeoff between the increase in pleasure and then the health consequences .
that &apos;s hard it sounds like .
but you know what but .
so if you &apos;re yeah .
just financially .
it &apos;s more financial than you actually wanting to quit .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
uh-huh .
so that sort of sounds like a plan to stop using methamphetamines .
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
who .
are these people are these people .
that are using drugs or .
these are coworkers .
of yours .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and that &apos;s because of their drug use .
oh .
drug use .
drug use can arrest your development .
yeah .
wow .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
it sounds like it &apos;s pretty destructive there &apos;s potential for pretty serious emotional and physical issues .
over a long period of time .
mm-hmm .
mm .
well so i don &apos;t know that we this i think we can be done with this .
i got the impression that you &apos;ve seen some pretty negative effects of drug use from a number of different drugs and that your use your methamphetamine use you &apos;ve well on the one hand it does have some positive side effects on the other hand it has costs problem with your teeth it &apos;s expensive you can &apos;t really afford it .
and you &apos;ve seen some people have some lifelong problems yeah due to .
and i got the impression that you are planning because you can &apos;t afford it that &apos;s gonna be kind of the way you &apos;re not gonna use and that may have some health benefits for you .
yeah .
yeah .
so you &apos;re kind of reducing your risk your health risk by choosing a particular kind of drug .
yeah .
mm .
yeah .
.
ooh .
yeah .
that &apos;s a serious health risk .
yeah .
so the last thing that i wanted to show you .
is you did a number of different kind of questionnaires with lea .
and your answers to these questionnaire kind of you fall into this scale of a level of risk that you may be associated that your drug use may be associated with .
and when we say risk we mean dangers that you may experience in mental health emotional medical financial whatever .
and this questionnaire is given to a whole bunch of people .
and so the level of risk is scaled from no risk at zero to ten being most severe risk .
of harm or of danger .
yeah across your life across your your medical your risk of medical problems your risk of having some kind of physical injury your risk of problems with your emotions or with your mental status risk of financial problems legal problems .
well i &apos;m kind of asked to ask you .
where do you think you fall on this scale within sort of this pyramid here in terms of your risk and your drug use .
currently your current drug use and where you might fall in there .
right .
okay .
all right the way you scored just from this questionnaire put you at a three which is moderate risk .
and then as you noticed yeah it doesn &apos;t kinda go up geometrically here .
so what do you think of that .
does that make sense to you .
and moderate risk .
particularly around health and around finances .
uh-huh anything else .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
so you &apos;re having some .
family problems because of the financial stuff too .
hmm thats too bad sorry to hear that .
mm-hmm .
well that about wraps this up .
i &apos;m gonna give you a call if that &apos;s okay with you in about a week and just kind of review what we talked about today .
all right .
this is a list of treatment resources if you &apos;re interested .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
to the down and out stories .
.
well there are other types of treatment that is not a a .
so but you can hang onto that if you want .
but i &apos;ll give you a call in about a week .
nice to meet you thanks for taking the time to talk with me .
this is that card that lea .
yeah it &apos;s a bunch of different places .
and this is her card .
and she &apos;ll call you in about three months .
uh-huh .
oh yeah she &apos;s not really i mean she &apos;s doing recruiting in the lobby but she &apos;s not really part of the clinic .
yeah so she &apos;ll call you and she definitely will because they &apos;re really big on following up with people .
well they are yeah they &apos;re .
well they &apos;re not really part of the clinic they &apos;re part of the it &apos;s a research study done by the university of washington .
family medicine clinic yeah i &apos;m a social worker in this clinic yeah .
medicine adult medicine is another primary care clinic but it &apos;s located in a different part of the hospital here .
well it &apos;s different providers it &apos;s different doctors yeah there &apos;s maybe an orientation on having entire families of all ages .
so you &apos;re treating kids all the way up to seniors .
where adult medicine it &apos;s primarily people who are of a certain age yeah there &apos;s a lot of flexibility and gray area there too .
no i don &apos;t .
yeah .
yeah i mean you can talk about it with both the clinic or the doctors and but .
yeah .
yeah well good that &apos;s what matters i guess .
all right .
take care i appreciate it .
that &apos;s all we do i &apos;m just gonna set it right there and we &apos;ll just ignore it .
so i &apos;m julie i &apos;m a social worker actually in the women &apos;s clinic .
but they were having trouble finding somebody up here to meet with you today because it &apos;s crazy .
thank you for taking the time to do this study .
i &apos;m sure it wasn &apos;t what you were expecting when you walked in the clinic today .
uh-huh .
tell me more about that .
uh-huh .
so it kinda radiates throughout huh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so it &apos;s a good kinda way to get out of the pain and relax .
yeah .
yeah .
and you say you take it on the weekends but not during the week .
and tell me more why weekends and why not other times .
so it sounds like it &apos;s kind your way to kinda keep it safe .
uh-huh .
so i &apos;m confused .
what would become the medical issue .
oh .
uh-huh but you feel like you &apos;ve kind of figured out a way to take care of it with kind of side skirting the medical yeah .
tell me why have you done that versus talk to your doctor about what &apos;s available for you particularly .
uh-huh kind of on a ongoing more chronic .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
right okay .
okay so tell me more .
so you feel like you &apos;re using it a little bit to relax .
uh-huh .
right okay .
okay .
but you &apos;ve kicked that it sounds like .
yeah so tell me how .
i mean that &apos;s pretty cool that you &apos;ve been able .
it &apos;s kinda on that edge a little bit you can see that but .
well you have to have been a very strong person to have kicked the alcohol drug stuff .
uh-huh .
right .
right so your thought is doing it on the weekend and not .
once .
once a week it &apos;s not gonna get you addicted but it provides some relief for your .
yeah .
but during the week your pain and .
you just you have to sort of charge through it yeah because you &apos;ve got a job and .
what kinda work do you do .
okay .
okay okay .
kinda all the time you see it from all the angles .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
so it is interesting because i mean you said a couple things when you said sort of the ultimate irony and also kind of realizing you &apos;re on that little tight rope .
the thing and i studied to become a chemical dependency counselor and i worked as one for a while .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
right that &apos;s a good point .
so for you you kind of weigh it that way how is it helping is it interfering with my life .
mm-hmm .
wow so throughout the week your jaw is just getting more and more tense .
uh-huh just takes some of that edge off .
right .
uh-huh .
.
so it seems like i can see where the benefits are .
you definitely are getting first of all it seems like you &apos;re figuring out a way to kinda manage the drug use in terms of kinda safety you know you have a job to do it &apos;s not .
right it &apos;s not interfering with your job because you &apos;re not doing it during the week it gives you a space to kind of relax your whole body get kinda calm on the weekend .
yeah it kind of takes that edge off .
you &apos;re not doing it while you &apos;re driving .
you &apos;re figuring out a good safe place to do it .
so all that what i &apos;m hearing from you feels like you kinda have figured out a lot of stuff but i also heard you say sort of knowing that you &apos;ve had sort of a history of drug and alcohol stuff you also realize you &apos;re on that tightrope .
what would it look like for you to drop off the tightrope in terms of what you &apos;re doing .
uh-huh .
so maybe you .
okay .
right .
right .
mm-hmm what &apos;s your .
i mean i don &apos;t .
okay uh-huh you &apos;d have to have a better source .
than she needs .
uh-huh .
so the .
uh-huh .
she doesn &apos;t really need very much .
right .
right .
i can kinda speculate how you might answer this but i &apos;m gonna ask you .
again why haven &apos;t you asked your doctor if there &apos;s some kind of .
uh-huh .
oh they do .
they do know that you .
uh-huh .
it sounds like you &apos;re really up front with your doctors about yeah and they know that you &apos;re getting it and that it &apos;s helping .
and are they saying this might not be useful to you or how .
they don &apos;t give you feedback at all huh .
huh interesting i mean i &apos;m not a doctor so but it is interesting .
interesting .
yeah .
huh i mean i would be kind of curious to ask them a little bit more what they think .
oh okay .
right right .
right so it &apos;s not like you &apos;ve built up this kinda comfortable rapport and .
right right .
right but it sounds like you &apos;re very open with them about how you &apos;re dealing with .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right so kind of .
uh-huh so now you &apos;re treating it with prescription pain relievers but .
uh-huh even while you were doing the other uh-huh and this seems like it &apos;s helped you the most .
mm-hmm so in addition to what else you &apos;re given .
uh-huh like ibuprofen kind of thing or .
uh-huh but high dose .
mm-hmm .
kinda on a scale of zero to ten how much do you think or how worried are you about the level of drug use that you have now .
doesn &apos;t sound like it yeah .
so zero .
mm-hmm and what .
yeah one to ten .
okay why a two versus a one .
mm-hmm because of your history .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
because your girlfriend has it .
and i mean i can speculate if you &apos;ve got your own supply it might be a larger supply and maybe more accessible to you .
mm-hmm so is it possible that doing what you &apos;re doing now feels safer to you .
more than a small dose small .
uh-huh .
right so it sounds like you &apos;ve got a pretty good handle on what works for you but it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s some kind of barrier that keeps you from making it kind of legitimate your own prescription .
yeah i wouldn &apos;t put it .
yeah i mean obviously nobody &apos;s kind of had a talk with you and you &apos;ve been very open about what you &apos;ve been doing .
and i mean i think the benefit to having it prescribed to you and then being able to monitor .
yeah .
ahh right so sort of just the legality of it would be a big benefit yeah .
well and i think the other benefit and again i &apos;m not a doctor but i speculate that one benefit would be they could monitor how is this particular drug working for you and are there potential side effects or whatever .
yeah and it kind of opens the door for you to be .
i mean you seem like a very open person .
but it opens the door to have even more of that communication .
yeah does it sound .
yeah i mean i don &apos;t want to put words in your mouth but it sounds like you are already talking with them about it .
it &apos;s just kinda .
yeah have you thought about taking that step to .
uh-huh did they tell you why .
okay .
uh-huh okay and is it .
and then what they have used in the past has have you tried that and it hasn &apos;t worked for you .
okay okay .
uh-huh in the same way .
right so any concerns about your kidneys and liver with the .
uh-huh it &apos;s small enough .
sounds like you &apos;ve done your kind of background work too .
right right how much are you taking .
uh-huh vicodin or .
mm-hmm so it sounds like i mean one of the benefits to talking about your doctor and if the doctor agrees yeah let &apos;s try this plan would be the legality for you and for your girlfriend .
but yeah .
i mean she risks something by offering her own drugs to you .
yeah yeah i mean you know the system well given that you work within that system and it sounds like well versed yeah .
i wanted to give you i know you filled out a bunch of these forms out there .
and it sounds like at this point that your only drug is doing this on the weekend no other alcohol or .
yeah you were able to get beyond that .
yeah how long ago did you stop .
wow so it &apos;s been a while .
okay .
so are .
okay so you &apos;ve got those meds too to sort of .
yeah i mean just hearing that too i think it &apos;s useful for a doctor to be able to see okay what &apos;s the interaction between these things .
right maybe having more of a conversation about it to just say hey can we what do you think of prescribing this it seems like it &apos;s helping me .
yeah but also your i mean it sounds like you also know yourself well enough to know don &apos;t give me a big huge bottle of high dose .
yeah you can do it little bit at a time and you &apos;re fine .
yeah tell me what other fears you have about it .
uh-huh .
right what keeps you from doing it every day .
uh-huh does your girlfriend provide some kind of support or .
uh-huh so she &apos;s surprised at how much you could take compared to her .
wow and have you done that at times .
how often does that happen .
yeah so what is ten times what she can take .
uh-huh .
so .
generally .
uh-huh how often do you think that you do that .
what gets you to that point .
mm-hmm .
right .
right .
it &apos;s all tense .
right .
what do you think gets your .
do you find yourself getting more and more that way as you .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so all this kinda connected pain basically .
mm-hmm it &apos;s not that like what i can imagine another would be that one week ten milligrams isn &apos;t working so the next week you do two it &apos;s not that kind of thing it &apos;s more that it &apos;s more what &apos;s happening and around your .
okay .
yeah .
i would .
it sounds like it &apos;s worth having that conversation with your doctor .
and you &apos;ve been open with them about what you &apos;ve tried and you know kind of what works .
ask them what the pros and cons of it is .
tell them you don &apos;t want that .
you have a choice .
yeah i mean you have kind of taken things in your control and you &apos;ve got a pretty good sense of who you are and what your body will take kind of what your tolerance for drugs and alcohol are .
yeah and you &apos;ve got a good sense of that .
i think it could be a dialogue .
yeah what do you think .
yeah how likely do you think it will be that you talk to them .
oh .
really .
oh .
wonderful wonderful .
i &apos;m gonna check back with you in about a week just to kind of check in see .
oh because it &apos;s not somebody you see today .
oh okay .
okay .
hmm .
uh-huh .
oh for .
and you &apos;ve already .
been seen today .
okay .
the cholesterol is .
right .
and it sounds like mostly they &apos;re monitoring your cholesterol .
yeah .
who do you see for the jaw tension .
see any body for one specific thing or kinda the whole person .
mm-hmm .
right right so .
kind of a crap shoot huh .
yeah you &apos;re seeing a lot of residents coming through .
right .
right right .
sounds like you &apos;ve got a good attitude about that too .
right right .
yeah .
so the next time you see somebody will probably be three or four months down the road .
you think at that point you &apos;ll .
yeah yeah .
you think so okay .
good good i mean it sounds like you do have a pretty good handle on what you &apos;re doing you &apos;ve got good insight .
but given that you have the bipolar disorder and that you &apos;ve got medications taking care of that you &apos;ve got the high cholesterol they &apos;re balancing all that .
it &apos;s kinda good to .
.
yeah .
what happens .
exactly that &apos;s a very good point that &apos;s a very good point .
and .
and you don &apos;t want your relationship with her to be just about keeping you in the drugs .
right .
exactly .
yeah so it kinda could clean that up a little bit too .
another option would be to think about let &apos;s get back in and see somebody sooner and you could .
you can wait .
are you crazy .
you know the system well .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
.
down there .
well i guess you &apos;ve got that option if for some reason things do flare up too between now and three or four months from now .
yeah .
seems like you &apos;re pretty stable .
good and how about the bipolar stuff .
is that pretty stable too .
.
oh but you &apos;re .
right .
so then it would be back in the same cycle again .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
for medicare you .
oh to have that supplement .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
oh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh and you get the .
oh cool .
that is a good deal .
it really gives you full kind of safety net .
uh-huh .
right .
right cool .
good .
uh-huh .
oh .
uh-huh .
.
and you get nowhere .
oh well .
because you don &apos;t want to have an overpayment or whatever .
yeah or underpayment .
right exactly .
exactly before we left i wanted to make sure you got .
one of the tests that you did was called the dast it &apos;s called a what does it stand for drug alcohol screening test .
and it gives you a rating between zero and ten in terms of kind of where your risk level is .
and that &apos;s kinda where you &apos;d landed are you surprised at that .
or does that seem appropriate .
yeah .
right and you kinda talked about you have a pretty good sense of what that risk is one the legality you &apos;re in the kind of relationship that you have with your girlfriend and keeping that open .
and i know i mentioned other drug interactions .
i don &apos;t know how how do you feel about that .
mm-hmm it seems like more it &apos;s about the legality .
yeah .
especially with your job .
right exactly .
yeah well you keep that in mind .
because i think that &apos;s a good thing to when that &apos;s at the forefront of your mind it &apos;s a good little stopping point too for you okay .
alright well it was really great to meet you .
i &apos;m gonna turn this off now .
okay well let me sort of .
first thank you for coming in .
you know it &apos;s a nice day out and we &apos;ve had a row of lousy days so i appreciate you taking the time .
and basically we &apos;re going to have a conversation .
and you filled out some materials upfront .
and do you have an idea of what that was about .
okay okay so .
okay .
okay okay so what you did is that you filled out what is a measure called the d a s t .
and it &apos;s the drug abuse screening test .
and there was it was scored from it was zero or really one to ten .
ten being severe risk zero being no risk .
where do you think you were on that scale .
um-hmm .
yeah .
you &apos;re right on yeah that &apos;s .
let me show you .
yeah you scored a five .
so that &apos;s really no surprise to you .
okay and that &apos;s what this triangle .
this is what it looks like .
yeah it is interesting .
what do you think about that .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
really .
okay .
so i &apos;m hearing you say that you have a real awareness of your drugs .
is it .
it &apos;s mostly drugs i didn &apos;t see any alcohol .
is it alcohol .
okay so .
yeah so mostly your drugs abuse of what &apos;s it caused what it &apos;s cost you in your life .
you &apos;ve had periods of sobriety and you &apos;ve had periods where it sounds like that was a real issue for you .
yeah okay and that you &apos;re looking to make some changes .
mm-hmm okay okay so it sounds like you &apos;re pretty .
like again on a measure zero to ten how confident are you that you can make the change .
mm-hmm .
so on a scale from zero to ten .
one .
hm why not zero .
mm-hmm .
yeah also i &apos;ve heard you &apos;ve experienced periods of sobriety that have been good for you .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm how did you manage that for ten years .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
um-hmm .
do you .
focus on family and .
uh-huh .
um-hmm um-hmm um-hmm okay so it sounds like you what i &apos;m hearing you say is that you had this period of sobriety that you were focused on working and family and it sounds like it was pretty hard .
tell me more about what &apos;s going on now .
it &apos;s okay .
and then pretty helpless and hopeless and .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
.
the drug that you frequently used was speed .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm did they know .
did they .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
and how i &apos;m sorry how did you do that .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
oh my god .
mm-hmm .
right well it sounds like you &apos;ve had i mean i &apos;m also hearing your parents were killed and then your son and that &apos;s what oh my gosh what a loop around alcohol and drug abuse .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
when was that .
wow .
when did you last use any drugs .
so it &apos;s .
been a year .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
wow .
wow so yes i &apos;ve been hearing it a lot of pain around drugs and alcohol .
.
with what you witnessed as a sixteen year old and from there to try to manage the pain .
and the aloneness and .
tragic .
i &apos;m also hearing that you realize that and you &apos;re working on changing you &apos;ve been clean and sober for a year and you &apos;re working on those folks aren &apos;t getting the right meds it &apos;s horrible .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
what .
yeah i mean it sounds i &apos;m hearing a lot of things being pulled in to help maintain your sobriety .
and .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
.
you talked about working .
that that &apos;s why yeah .
um-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
hm .
i &apos;m not here to say let &apos;s let &apos;s not yeah .
but i &apos;m hearing just a a lot of things that .
options that you have are it &apos;s how people decide like you &apos;ve decided to completely stop .
and working on different options on how to support that .
because i &apos;m also hearing that when you &apos;re using you had a you functioned in work and family to many degrees it &apos;s also sounds like there were some issues going on your kid was getting in and so there &apos;s stuff going on that when somebody &apos;s not using maybe they would whatever but that there &apos;s stuff going on .
and but you &apos;re you don &apos;t i agree with you there &apos;s reasons that people use drugs it &apos;s not that it &apos;s all horrible because otherwise nobody would touch it you know .
.
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
it sounds like .
okay well how important is it for you to change this from zero to ten .
it sounds like it &apos;s pretty like you &apos;re .
i mean it &apos;s really important .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
it &apos;s painful .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
well i &apos;m hearing you realize all of the options that you have .
you could maintain your sobriety .
you could you go back to using .
you could try to be functioning again .
you could and there &apos;s treatment and things available and things like that .
i think .
why .
i mean that &apos;s that takes .
yeah i &apos;ll give you a list of these are some programs sheets and resources here okay .
i want to thank you for taking the time today .
and can i tell you what i think i heard you say .
i mean can i tell you what i think i heard you say .
okay you experienced a severe horrible tragedy not a lot of support no support out on the street finding a way to survive which worked you &apos;re here today you &apos;re here you survived you survived enough that you connected and made children and throughout that is this sort of the thread of addiction and how that has been woven through in not only your life but your family &apos;s life and the sort of the narrative your family narrative it sounds like but you &apos;re sick of it you want that life back i think it &apos;s you want and i think i mean you &apos;re because you talk about you take care of yourself you have certain things that are important to you and that you &apos;re willing to talk to people and to be open and work on these things try different medications and try and you exercise and do things for yourself .
so i &apos;m hearing it &apos;s that kind of freshness is for the when you i &apos;m going back to like i &apos;m thinking here you were sixteen years old you experienced this horrible tragedy and kind of lost that teenage edge you know that you lost it and part of you right now kind of has that freshness of that teenager you &apos;re kind of going back to that who was i back then and how can i capture that sweetness and i &apos;m hearing that you can do that in certain ways and you &apos;re struggling with a lot and but you &apos;re working on it .
does that sound right .
well good well why don &apos;t you go ahead and take those resources .
and here &apos;s this gift card it &apos;ll .
it &apos;s for participating in this study .
okay nice meeting you today .
thank you for sharing with me .
you know why .
alright so again my name is lauren i &apos;m a social worker in clinic .
and wanted to come in and speak with you today if you don &apos;t mind about your drug use .
i &apos;m sure naomi prepped you a little bit for that right .
yeah yeah so what brings you in to clinic in general .
uh-huh .
so you came in specifically for this study then .
okay .
alright .
sure .
alright and here you are .
okay so how would you feel kind of starting off and filling me in on substances that you use and .
so it sounds like the pain medication is kind of keeping you from using every day maybe so if you didn &apos;t have that pain medication .
you &apos;d be .
sure .
okay but the medication doesn &apos;t sound like enough to keep you from using the heroin either .
take .
so you take a little more medication .
okay .
okay .
mm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
but it sounds like you &apos;re still using the heroin because it is that different high .
yeah .
and how long have you been balancing the two .
mm-hmm .
brought you back around .
mm-hmm .
okay and it also looks like and naomi was telling me a little bit about some methadone use .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
oh goodness .
mm .
mm .
so is the heroin manage the pain as well .
or do you feel that the methadone is effective in managing that .
mm-hmm .
yeah yeah it sounds like you &apos;re safe .
but it sounds like you &apos;re calculated that you you &apos;re trying not to o d you &apos;re aware that you have these other substances to kind of balance things out and you go about it in the safest way you possibly can it sounds like .
mm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
it sounds like the social group is what brought you back to it as you mentioned before .
okay and are there any differences between your use now and your use .
before you were incarcerated and before you said i &apos;m just gonna kick the habit .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
hmm a lot of consequences for being out of control in a sense with the use before incarceration you lost your job .
yeah and now it sounds like it &apos;s different as you mentioned before .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm your family is important family friends taking care of yourself it sounds like your health also priority .
that &apos;s great .
that &apos;s a real tough habit .
.
yeah .
one day at a time .
yeah .
that &apos;s excellent .
so where do you see yourself down the road .
we &apos;ve talked a little bit about the past and where you are now and how you have a sense of control over your use and now it sounds like you &apos;re not looking to go back and repeat what happened before yeah .
yeah .
sure .
mm-hmm .
sure .
mm-hmm .
it sounds like you have a lot of support you have a lot of support you have these goals in mind you know where the drug can take you if you let it take you there and that &apos;s not a place you &apos;re willing to go .
yeah .
sure those are all big motivators to keep you either using it the way you &apos;re using now right .
or possibly looking at cutting back in the future .
have you ever considered that .
not necessarily quitting altogether because .
mm-hmm .
you like .
sure .
feels good .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
sure .
yeah .
i like this idea of a recess that you call it .
you said it feels kinda like a recess .
and i imagine you take a little break you have this opportunity .
sure .
mm-hmm .
sure .
so how do you feel with your current situation .
the way you &apos;re using now it sounds like it you feel pretty comfortable with it .
worse sure .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
i appreciate you sharing .
it sounds to me like you really are aware of where you don &apos;t want this to go .
yeah .
yeah .
so those things getting sick the fear of incarceration the fear of losing the family the fear of losing the life that you have now which sounds like it &apos;s better than it was before .
yeah those things it sounds like are keeping you from using more or for seeking out the heroin or going down that .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
yeah .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
wired up .
mm-hmm .
it sounds like you &apos;re not searching .
you &apos;re not out there searching for the drug like you did before .
and like these other people using cocaine that you were talking about that are you know constantly out there seeking looking for .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
sure .
yeah you know the consequences .
yeah alright .
again it really sounds like you know what &apos;s keeping you from going in that direction and again looking forward and looking at where we are right now it sounds like you &apos;re pretty comfortable with the way things are .
you set a good goal of not going down that road you know your limits .
and that you can &apos;t go down there sounds like it &apos;s a pretty dark place .
mm-hmm .
sure .
mm-hmm .
yeah you have many responsibilities .
yeah .
yeah .
are there any changes you would like to make .
mm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
yeah .
sure .
yeah those supports are really important to have kinda keep you in line .
so well from my perspective this is what it &apos;s all about is really learning about how your substance use has impacted your life and kinda leaving you with options you know with which is what we &apos;ve kinda been discussing .
now is there change in the future it sounds like maybe so but right now we &apos;re comfortable with where we are and it sounds like you have really good control over your use and that you &apos;re making some calculated decisions .
mm .
mm you &apos;re not that yeah you &apos;re not that person not that person anymore .
.
yeah it sounds like you &apos;ve already made a lot of changes a lot of steps toward becoming kind of this person that you &apos;d like to be this idea of managing your drug use a little bit better .
mm-hmm .
sure the choices .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
sure .
great well i have your card here .
how would you feel if i followed up with you in a couple weeks gave you a phone call just to check in and see how things are going .
sounds good alright i &apos;ll give you your card .
yeah it &apos;s in the profile .
so kroger is the gift card that you asked for .
alright there you are .
that &apos;s for q f c uh-huh yup .
alright you &apos;re welcome .
it was nice to meet you .
okay .
yeah so let me explain a little so the purpose of this kinda brief intervention is for us to talk about some of the things that you talked about with joey and then that includes your drug use .
and we &apos;re recording it to see what the impact of people just by having this conversation what the impact is gonna be on future drug use .
and then we wanna have a record of what the what the conversation was like .
and it &apos;s all confidential and it &apos;s no one is gonna know anything about you know your name and being tied with this .
and of course you know your providers here aren &apos;t gonna have any they &apos;re not privy to this conversation either .
okay so again like i said i this is you know hopefully to be a continuation of the some of the things that you were talking about with joey .
so can you tell me a little bit about your drug use and how you &apos;re feeling about it .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm right .
mm-hmm .
okay .
right so you feel like you &apos;re needing to smoke marijuana so that you can .
eat .
yeah otherwise .
okay okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right so you don &apos;t smoke marijuana other times only before dinner .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
uh-huh .
right .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm-hmm .
so you know it &apos;s important to eat and eat right as a diabetic and your .
right .
hmm .
right which is a little risky if you &apos;re a diabetic to not eat yeah .
wow .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
to talk with your doctor about it .
all right .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
right .
yeah well that &apos;s not a bad idea .
i mean if you &apos;re having some concerns about .
your appetite .
and that you know you gotta eat because you have to maintain your blood sugar level right .
then it &apos;s probably not a bad idea yeah .
right .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
okay .
all right .
so what else .
okay .
so you .
so you use .
cocaine as a sexual stimulant .
okay .
you used to smoke .
okay .
mm-hmm .
right .
okay .
freebasing or .
okay .
right .
so what is it .
can you tell me a little bit more about using cocaine as sexual stimulant .
how do you feel about using cocaine as a sexual stimulant .
say that again the .
oh okay yeah .
okay .
so are you thinking the cocaine is something that makes or what you &apos;re saying is it makes it more pleasurable or it makes it just possible .
okay .
and you &apos;ve tried du other types of .
oh okay .
with your .
so you &apos;ve talked with your doctor about this and .
and this .
right and he said that well i mean you &apos;re what you &apos;re saying is that it hasn &apos;t been effective so you you &apos;re continuing to use cocaine .
right .
okay .
uh-huh .
okay .
yeah .
so it sounds like .
yeah .
well you &apos;re gonna go with what works it sounds like .
yeah .
so you &apos;re thinking a little bit about some of these things being psychological .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
yeah .
right .
so it sounds like you &apos;re aware that there as you &apos;re getting older it &apos;s not something you can do every day .
right .
well so tell me a little bit more about that .
what concerns you about that every day .
uh-huh .
i see .
okay .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay .
all right .
mm-hmm .
so you have a history of some alcoholism .
okay .
right .
so then you know on the one hand it sounds like there are some positive things about cocaine use about marijuana use .
on the other hand it sounds like you &apos;re pretty aware of some of well of .
so what can you tell me a little bit about what those awareness or what you &apos;re aware of that &apos;s .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
right .
so as far as you &apos;re concerned marijuana is really not very harmful because it &apos;s .
okay .
right .
right .
how about .
other people .
do you think you &apos;re different .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
okay .
mm-hmm .
sure .
okay .
so marijuana is not so bad but the cocaine is a bad thing .
yeah .
so if you &apos;re if you when it would it be a bad thing for you .
when would you know like oh man this is becoming bad .
mm-hmm .
right and you &apos;re not doing that .
but you &apos;re .
aware that there may be a risk of escalated use at some point .
is that .
no .
not for you okay .
what are you doing to .
control use .
using .
your head .
right .
uh-huh .
okay .
right .
uh-huh .
right .
so you &apos;re using the well you feel like may be the consequences of cocaine which sounds like you know what the consequence are .
like lack of energy and not being able to get up as a way to not use so much right .
all right .
okay .
right .
uh-huh .
okay .
right .
mm-hmm .
right well .
it sounds like you &apos;ve been able to set some limits on what you &apos;re gonna use and what you &apos;re not and even what you are using right .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
how would you know if things were out of control .
right .
and then .
it &apos;d be too late to change anything .
okay .
so you &apos;re aware of that .
all right .
right .
yeah .
okay .
right .
so you learned from your experiences .
right .
mm-hmm .
right .
right .
you &apos;ve had that experience yeah .
okay .
what changes yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
right .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
that &apos;s a long time yeah .
yeah .
so it sounds like what you really identified as the concern for you is your alcohol use .
okay tell me a little bit .
more about that .
mm-hmm .
okay .
uh-huh .
on those boats .
wow .
so you feel like this is that &apos;s where your alcohol and drug use began it was on the .
on those ships .
what is it more .
yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah it sounds like you &apos;ve had some pretty amazing experiences .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
kinda a culture there yeah .
yeah .
right .
so tell me why is .
yeah you gotta probably be careful huh .
tell me what it is about alcohol that concerns you more than these other two .
uh-huh .
right .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
right .
mm-hmm .
right .
right .
for appetite yeah .
well that would be a conversation to have with the doctor perhaps yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
so you .
yeah .
well that i appreciate your being so open .
yeah .
sure .
okay .
mm-hmm .
right .
so tell me a little bit about what you &apos;ve thought about how you might change or how you may confront this problem that you have with alcohol that you &apos;re telling me about .
mm-hmm .
right .
mm-hmm .
oh okay .
mm-hmm .
okay .
so what does that make you think about treatment .
yeah .
right .
mm-hmm .
right .
so .
it sounds like yeah you &apos;re .
you &apos;ve a lot of this is sorta based on your own kinda psychological .
idea but .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah right .
you learned from that .
yeah .
okay .
so what is it that you would like to change if there was one thing you could identify .
mm-hmm .
well i guess in terms of some of the things that we &apos;ve been talking about .
mm-hmm .
right .
so what you &apos;re saying is if there was something you could take that would increase your appetite something that you could take that would help with some sexual stimulation right .
there you go yeah .
it &apos;s worth a shot huh .
yeah .
right .
right .
yeah .
have you tried it .
right .
yeah .
so it sounds like it &apos;s important for you to change .
but you don &apos;t you &apos;re not really necessarily sure about how confident you are about changing .
mm-hmm .
okay .
well i appreciate you taking the time to do this you know .
mm-hmm .
right .
uh-huh .
okay .
right .
sure .
mm-hmm .
right .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
so what are you gonna do using your mind to help kinda change some of this stuff .
how does that work .
mm-hmm .
right .
right .
yeah .
right .
across the street okay .
right so it sounds like things don &apos;t get out of control when you &apos;re doing it at home and you &apos;re doing in your own space right but you &apos;re still maybe feeling like boy it &apos;d be better good to maybe drink a little less .
mm-hmm .
oh right .
mm-hmm .
okay .
right .
.
mm-hmm .
when you &apos;re at home .
yeah .
okay .
mm-hmm .
so have you come up with any plans or anything that you can think of that would help you try to maybe cut down some on the alcohol .
right .
right .
yeah .
what do you think would be helpful .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
right .
so your health hasn &apos;t really necessarily been affected is what your doctor is telling you .
right .
all right .
so you &apos;ve had .
you know that at some point can &apos;t go on living like this necessarily .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
right .
so is this something new that you started thinking .
or is this something that &apos;s been going on for a long time .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
right .
you &apos;ve kinda developed a tolerance and .
yeah .
right .
yeah .
right .
right .
well o would you mind if i give you a maybe a little bit of feedback then and some maybe a suggestion of .
so you &apos;re you know your primary doctors here in the adult medicine clinic and there are chemical dependency counselors here in the adult medicine clinic .
and you can just even schedule an appointment if you wanna talk with somebody maybe about what you might do or what some options are .
i mean it would just be you could even be kinda an informal sorta chat similar you know .
okay and you can just make that appointment at the front desk if you &apos;re interested .
her name is .
mm-hmm .
okay .
and i would like to give you this list of treatment resources and it &apos;s there &apos;s all sorts of different resources on here that you can look at .
there &apos;s a sorta twenty four hour .
i think you needed this to .
oh did he .
there &apos;s all sorts of different resources on here if you &apos;re interested you know .
okay .
all right .
all right and if you have any questions about that you know you can certainly talk with me again on here .
rosemary or kathleen yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
no .
mm-hmm .
right .
yeah i don &apos;t know if they bill or not for i don &apos;t think that they do .
you mean there &apos;ll be a charge for i think just coming and meeting with somebody here in the clinic .
but you could do it on the same day as your primary care doctor and it wouldn &apos;t be anything extra for that .
yeah .
.
and i also wanna share with you the results of those tests that you took or one of the surveys that you did .
and it was called the drug abuse screening test .
and it was one of the things that you had done with joey .
and it rates someone &apos;s risk in terms of how much harm they may be in depending on their drug use .
and the risk runs from zero as no risk to ten which is severe risk .
and by the way that you answered your questions just i guess curious as to what you think your risk might be going from zero risk to ten as being the highest risk the risk of harm from drug use .
yeah .
okay .
right .
so you .
your perception of marijuana is pretty low risk of harm right .
so what would .
right .
yeah .
right .
so .
what about .
okay .
those two things would be sorta higher risk for you right .
so where do you .
yeah .
so where would you rate yourself in terms of what you feel like your risk of harm is from alcohol and cocaine .
yeah .
five okay .
well your score came out in that sorta moderate risk range .
which is three to five .
so you were your you &apos;ve got a pretty good perception of that then if you kinda trust this scale it &apos;s rating .
right .
yeah .
right .
okay .
yeah .
sure oh they still sell it it &apos;s legal .
so part of you know part of this whole conversation was just to talk with you about what you feel like is going on for you .
and what you feel like maybe you have thought about changing and how you would go about that .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
okay .
and it sounds like you &apos;ve put some thought into changing that yeah in a way that you could go about it that &apos;s good it &apos;s difficult it &apos;s good for a while yeah .
yeah .
uh-huh .
right .
yeah .
okay .
right so we &apos;ve talked about some places that where you might start .
so do you have any questions or anything that i can .
and i would like to follow up with you again in a week .
we can have .
kinda a maybe a similar conversation maybe review a little bit about what we talked about .
where can how can i get a hold of you .
mm-hmm .
okay .
is that a home phone .
all right .
okay all right if you have any further questions you can always ask to talk with the social worker sharon and fleming .
i &apos;m gonna call you and we &apos;re gonna have a similar conversation like we had today just to kinda review some of the things .
right .
i &apos;m well i &apos;m with the research and my part of the research is just to have this kinda conversation that we just had with you okay .
joey &apos;s part of the research is to maybe ask you some more to fill out some more forms and that &apos;s for another urine sample and that &apos;s his part .
so after we talk on the phone our part together will be done and then he &apos;s gonna try to just continue to follow up with you every three months .
.
right .
for a year and they wanna find out if your answers on any of these things changed stayed the same whatever .
and that &apos;s the end of the .
mm-hmm .
the idea is to see if if us having a conversation like we just did and then maybe a short follow up phone call if that &apos;s gonna have any impact on your drug use or not .
and that part of that was just talking about what you think would be helpful and where you feel like you are with that and kinda coming up with a plan so .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
all right .
all right well it was nice to meet you .
and thanks for spending the .
okay today &apos;s date is june twenty fifth it &apos;s a thursday and it &apos;s about oh twelve fifty five p.m. and i have here daniel reeves and so daniel i want to ask you again do you consent to having this recorded today .
excellent great .
okay so you met claire and joey .
yeah how was your experience out there talking with them and filling out the paperwork .
don &apos;t mind at all .
okay .
you &apos;ve done it before .
oh okay okay so you &apos;re not new you &apos;re not new to doing it then .
okay okay well i &apos;m talking with you today just to learn about your drug use .
and i &apos;m not here to judge you in any way or to make you change in any way .
okay .
all right so you did complete this what &apos;s called a drug abuse screening test also called dast .
it &apos;s a questionnaire and it looks like you scored a four right here .
moderate risk .
how do you feel about that .
what do you think about .
do you agree .
okay well tell me more about that .
yeah .
do you have your reasons .
why you agree with the score .
you &apos;re not severe yet so you &apos;re feeling moderate .
is better than severe .
right okay so yeah tell me about your drug use then .
okay okay .
okay and how long have you had these problems .
okay .
okay .
okay how long you been using marijuana then .
that &apos;s a long time in between many many years .
okay .
okay so you quit on your own cold turkey about ten years ago .
and you used it for three years .
yeah that &apos;s a long time .
wow that &apos;s amazing .
wow so .
um-hum um-hum .
okay okay .
okay .
you &apos;re not an alcohol drinker much .
so it sounds like when you started cocaine years ago that was because of the social influence .
okay .
yeah well i really admire your ability to actually quit after .
so many years and going cold turkey at that .
so you know it sounds like you &apos;re having a lot a lot of praying a lot of will power and .
right so .
right but you managed to stay quitting right .
terrific .
sure .
yeah well that &apos;s great it &apos;s good to hear that .
yeah the marijuana piece you started using when you were a teenager and you quit and then you got on it again years later .
okay so it sounds like you &apos;re able to recognize you know physically and you think about it that you &apos;re able to stop that you have a you know you can .
you have a choice .
how long have you been doing the weed since you got back on it .
okay .
so your weed use has increased in the last ten years .
it &apos;s decreased .
oh i &apos;m sorry your .
yeah you did say that earlier .
that &apos;s terrific i mean that &apos;s a lot of work .
that &apos;s a lot of that &apos;s a lot of work though .
good .
yeah i mean exercise is a big thing with weight loss now .
when i said your marijuana use increased .
when the pain started to become more unbearable .
okay .
okay .
okay .
well you lost an incredible amount of weight .
and doing the exercise regularly .
so that has that alleviated some of the pain in your knees and .
um-hum .
okay so how often would you say you do it now .
okay so you do use it daily .
okay okay .
yeah yeah .
okay .
okay .
so you say that you don &apos;t want to take narcotics because of the addictive factor .
and marijuana i mean you sort of caught yourself there marijuana still .
um-hum would you say that marijuana increases your appetite or decreases your appetite .
or it sort of .
yeah you know that marijuana has that that effect .
okay .
well what other health problems do you think is linked to your drug use .
okay .
so it &apos;s pretty hard when you have to deal with the pain pretty regularly and then you &apos;re surrounded by people who .
who use .
it regularly .
so that &apos;s a tough situation to be .
okay so say on a scale of one to ten how important is it to stop using for you .
ten okay .
that &apos;s pretty high .
yeah have you thought about that .
so it sounds like right now it &apos;s not a priority for you your priority is the health problem and .
tell me about some .
okay .
okay .
yes yeah sounds like you &apos;ve got some health issues there .
um-hum .
range .
yeah i mean .
diabetes is a tough thing to deal with let me tell you .
yeah .
that &apos;s excellent .
yeah but that &apos;s excellent though i tell you one ten for a diabetic .
um-hum .
okay well it sounds like you &apos;ve thought about things you know having been through experiences and educating yourself and being a little more proactive about .
um-hum .
well i do appreciate that .
now earlier you said that the negative thing about using marijuana is you know sooner or later it &apos;s gonna affect your lungs .
okay well .
yeah .
right so it sounds like your social circle is pretty important to you and it sounds like it &apos;s also related to how you whether you &apos;re gonna smoke the marijuana or smoke cigarettes .
okay .
so you do have some control over that kind of .
laugh .
okay so it sounds like when you do use it you think enough ahead to keep yourself safe .
i mean at home .
yeah that &apos;s that &apos;s i mean kudos to you for the exercise part .
now do you see any other negative things related to marijuana use .
because you know you &apos;re right about the first part it does impact your lungs and more so than nicotine smoking does .
where did you learn that from somebody or .
okay .
okay .
okay yeah that &apos;s so you do recognize that you are addicted to it .
well do you see any negative things then about using marijuana .
okay tell me more about that .
do you have any examples .
um-hum .
right so .
it &apos;s tricky .
so you know you &apos;ve tried other things .
.
okay .
yeah the incredible amount of weight loss has that &apos;s really you know inspiring .
yeah yeah .
well .
you care about what you eat .
you &apos;re saying that in the past and you sound like you &apos;ve really come a long way and you &apos;ve struggled a lot but yet here you are you &apos;ve made all these life changes .
you care about yourself you want to take care of yourself you want to be around .
um-hum .
yeah isn &apos;t it just amazing .
how you know life the continuum of life and what people experience .
that &apos;s .
yeah that &apos;s important to you .
yeah terrific .
well now if you could if the time were right to make the changes .
since you scored a ten on wanting to quit .
what would that look like for you if the time were right .
yeah .
yeah ten is a match there so you sound like you do .
okay .
um-hum .
well it sounds like there might be options .
well you &apos;ve lost all this weight and certainly the pain .
um-hum .
okay .
you &apos;re maintaining that pain .
okay .
okay .
right right .
okay .
um-hum .
um-hum .
this is .
all the stuff you &apos;re talking about working out in counseling .
and that must have been .
yeah that must have been really hard to hear .
but look here you are .
you &apos;ve got all these emotions coming at you and .
okay so it sounds like then using marijuana also helps you know mentally and emotionally .
uh-huh .
that &apos;s great therapy .
um-hum .
so where do you think you go from here then at this point .
okay .
yeah well you &apos;ve lived a long time with all this stuff you &apos;re dealing with and you &apos;re continuing to deal with things .
so that &apos;s you know that &apos;s very very difficult but .
well on the other hand here you are though you know you &apos;re a success in many ways because you &apos;ve lost over how many three hundred pounds your health started improving when you were doing that you sought help you &apos;re seeing a counselor to work out all of these things from childhood time and you know that impacted who you are today and it &apos;s sort of helping you deal with everyday stress too and you want to change on a scale of one to ten you say you want to do a ten but you &apos;re so worried about how it &apos;s going to manage your pain if you do quit .
yeah you said you &apos;re not into the pills and .
um-hum .
okay sure but now you know you &apos;re sort of still on the edge and you &apos;re not ready to do it and your priority at this point really is your mental health and managing the pain at a level at a manageable level .
okay so i think your options are that you can manage your using marijuana .
you can eliminate some of the risks .
and it sounds like you &apos;re doing some of that when you &apos;re saying you stay at home you &apos;re not driving .
you .
eliminate the risk when you &apos;re using .
your other option is not to change at all .
okay .
okay .
okay .
maybe the best thing right now is just you know knowing that being aware of that .
okay .
yeah .
so you trust your counselor then .
they &apos;re good for you .
good .
it &apos;s important to have that as an option too .
okay .
yeah yeah .
so when you are ready to take that step you know where to go you know how to seek the help .
that &apos;s great i like that attitude .
i like that plan you came up with though .
you know when you &apos;re ready to do it .
just i know it &apos;s coming you have that worry about the pain and you know being too much pain .
but talking about surgery continuing to lose weight i mean i think those are really good options .
when you &apos;re ready to do it .
those are good options to try .
it sounds like you &apos;re really working closer with your doctor too .
.
yeah .
yeah .
yeah well you know .
regardless of what you decide to do i think you have that sort of that determination to do it .
.
good people right faith you have faith .
um-hum .
yeah .
that &apos;s good .
okay .
yeah i mean and i can tell i can tell it &apos;s an inner struggle with you .
i think no matter what though like i said i think you &apos;re strong enough you know .
to get yourself where you need to go you need to go so .
okay .
okay daniel well thanks for talking with me i really do appreciate that .
and participating in this research project .
you certainly did .
and i and yeah thanks for talking with me .
um no .
no no not at all i just make little notes for myself .
and i call you back in a week to touch base with you .
in fact let me get a good contact number for you .
and what &apos;s a good time to call you .
okay .
that &apos;s okay .
okay terrific so i &apos;ll call you in about a week just to follow up on this conversation that we had and see where things are at .
um oh gosh you know what i don &apos;t .

let &apos;s see it &apos;s now twelve i &apos;m sorry it &apos;s one thirty eight .
and this ends the interview .
okay so again my name is matt .
and i &apos;m a social worker here in the adult medicine clinic and .
i &apos;m hoping to kind of continue the conversation with you around some of the questions you and joey were going through on all of the forms that you filled out .
is that alright with you .
okay so as you know since you just finished filling out all that paperwork this is kind of about your drug use and how you feel about it and what your kind of perception of that is .
would you mind telling me a little bit how you feel about your drug use right now .
okay .
okay .
sure .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
so you &apos;ve been using drugs for years about thirty years it sounds like and you still have temptations so yeah .
uh-huh .
yeah .
so you &apos;ve reduced your drug use recently .
okay .
one time in six months .
wow that &apos;s great .
mm-hmm .
right now you &apos;ve .
put some effort into really reducing your drug use .
yeah .
tell me some of the things you &apos;ve done to do that .
okay .
mm-hmm .
that &apos;s great .
mm-hmm .
right so what has been helpful for you is really being around different people .
and it &apos;s hard coming up here .
yeah .
what &apos;s hard about coming up here .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
and you &apos;re you can recognize that clearly yeah .
yeah .
see a .
mile away .
yeah .
right .
and people are receptive to that with you you find .
yeah alright .
yeah .
yeah .
how are you able to do that to take that step to just yeah .
yeah .
real physical symptoms real physical yeah yeah wow .
right .
yeah .
so how how are you able .
even with all of that how are you able .
what does it take explain that to me .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
okay .
is that program with your doctor .
with rosemary .
okay okay .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
alright so you &apos;re committed to staying true to the program that you &apos;ve agreed to and that &apos;s gonna that &apos;s gonna uh-huh .
percent .
it sounds like you are that &apos;s that &apos;s yeah .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
yeah that sounds hard i would think it would be difficult to do it just that one time and then and then say no .
how do you do that .
yeah .
yeah it &apos;s a real battle huh .
yeah so it takes a lot of strength you have a lot of strength to be able to do that .
yeah what would you call it .
mm .
there are some things that you &apos;re pretty committed to and you &apos;re gonna stick with that yeah .
yup .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
he was testing you huh .
well and .
you were able to stick to your .
commitment .
oh .
well that &apos;s great .
uh-huh .
right .
well from what you &apos;ve told me you &apos;ve come a long way to change your drug use and you have and you &apos;ve stuck with what you &apos;ve agreed to .
and it sounds like you &apos;re committed to see those things .
yeah .
yeah .
so group treatment doesn &apos;t work for you .
hi .
so do you need this room .
let me i &apos;m gonna stop this real well i can &apos;t hold on a second how do you pause it .
well we &apos;re almost done here we &apos;ll find somewhere else to go and just finish up here okay .
that &apos;s alright .
so let &apos;s go around the corner over here .
let &apos;s go maybe we can just pop in here real quick .
so .
sorry about that .
so i just want to a couple things i want to kind of share with you .
and i don &apos;t want to keep you from rosemary but .
mm-hmm yeah what did i do with the okay so one of the forms that joey had you fill out was called a drug abuse screening test .
and the results of that rate you on a risk scale and the risk scale is from zero to ten .
zero is the low risk ten is the most high risk and by risk they mean sort of risk of harm to .
no well to sort of yourself in terms of your emotional health right .
yeah .
okay well that &apos;s good and .
so that &apos;s what this scale rates you on .
and based on your answers what would you think your level of risk would be .
moderate .
okay .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay .
yeah .
so you have strategies already to reduce your risk of harm when you &apos;re feeling like you might use yeah okay .
okay .
so your rating based on your answers on this scale .
i know you said you felt like it was moderate .
this comes out as you being pretty severe on the high end of risk .
what do you make of that .
okay .
yeah .
and you know that and it sounds like you &apos;ve experienced that but you &apos;re wanting to not do that .
yeah .
right .
okay .
yeah .
right and you know that that &apos;s yeah .
right .
you &apos;ve .
got some good motivations then to continue doing what you &apos;re doing and you &apos;re .
oh my .
well that &apos;s pretty strong motivation yeah .
so tell me what things are you gonna do to not go down that path .
yeah .
right .
right .
right .
great wow it sounds like you &apos;ve got great people around you .
yeah .
good yeah well it sounds like they &apos;re there for you .
so keep it up .
so your goal really right now it sounds like is to quit using crack permanently and maybe reduce the marijuana .
so that &apos;s not really an issue alright so okay good .
.
well you &apos;ve made some pretty significant steps .
and i &apos;m happy to hear that and .
you .
i think that we can probably wrap this up .
do you have any questions or anything .
alright .
i &apos;ll let her .
know alright and .
so i &apos;m gonna the next step in this would be for us to touch base again in a week .
yeah .
so i &apos;ll call you and maybe review some of the stuff we talked about and just see how things are going .
but i don &apos;t have your phone number either .
to joe .
alright .
would you mind .
calling me maybe leaving it on my voicemail .
it &apos;s right there .
you can .
call any time .
alright mister thank you very much for your time .
this is that for you and .
keep up with the good work .
and we &apos;ll talk to you later .
okay thanks .
okay we are recording now just so you know .
so a little bit about what the project is about it &apos;s to talk to you a little bit about your drug use about what &apos;s going on when you &apos;re using .
and you did a questionnaire for him and he scored you .
and here &apos;s the score .
a dast score .
well i &apos;m not exactly .
it &apos;s the drug abuse screening test .
and it says what your risks are as far as to how much drugs .
when he did the first intake with you that you &apos;re using and it puts you you scored a six .
and it puts you up in severe risk for complications related to your drug use and that &apos;s medical probably legal .
you know just what it &apos;s doing to your life .
so what do you think about that .
do you have any thoughts about that .
or is this exactly where you thought you might be or .
you nodded your head you know when you were looking at that .
right .
ah .
yeah .
so it sounds like you &apos;ve been thinking that it would be better to save your money for .
um-hum .
um-hum .
right right so when you say you &apos;ve been kind of you &apos;ve been thinking about this more .
has it changed you in any way or .
um-hum .
tell me a little bit more about that what .
about how you &apos;re .
i mean it sounds those all sound like things that are not very making you feel very good the coward feeling depressed .
uh-huh .
so when you don &apos;t have a good day what happens .
um-hum .
okay so when you &apos;re going along and the day &apos;s going pretty good you don &apos;t feel like using .
but one bump in that road and then .
you don &apos;t you wanna use .
right .
yeah .
um-hum .
um-hum .
are there ever times when you have a day that you &apos;ve hit that bump in the road that you don &apos;t use drugs .
okay .
yeah .
yeah but if you don &apos;t have if you can &apos;t get them are there times when you absolutely can &apos;t get them .
um-hum so how do you get your money right now .
um-hum do you sell .
sort of illegal activity .
yeah yeah so when you have are there any good times when you &apos;re when you &apos;re not using the drugs that you can recall .
tell me about that .
um-hum .
and those are days that you would not use any drugs .
okay .
right .
um-hum .
so it sounds like you &apos;ve been asking yourself that a bit .
is it have you been asking yourself that a bit more lately or .
all the time .
okay and what makes it more something that you &apos;re thinking about now than before .
um-hum .
okay .
um-hum .
how old are you larry .
okay .
yeah .
right .
um-hum .
so .
this is great that you &apos;re you know that you &apos;re thinking more about this i think that &apos;s really .
because with every step you know thinking is kind of the beginning of a plan .
so do you have a plan on how you might make those changes .
have you thought more about that .
and tell me how that would help that money management skills .
right .
and how might you do that .
have you .
um-hum .
um-hum um-hum have you ever tried to kick the habit .
um-hum .
okay so when that serious in that time when you seriously tried to quit what &apos;d you do .
you know whatever works is not crazy .
i do wanna know .
um-hum .
uh-huh .
right .
were you doing this by yourself or were you .
uh-huh .
right right .
um-hum .
so it really truly to me it sounds like you &apos;ve really been thinking about this pretty hard .
and that you &apos;ve actually gone a week &apos;s time where you really worked and did probably what more than any treatment program could do .
no thank you .
i think that &apos;s really very insightful and positive .
um-hum .
yeah yeah but yeah that &apos;s but you i think you &apos;ve got some right steps in there .
i think that &apos;s the getting the control of those thoughts takes practice probably .
and you have a week of practicing of the you know .
do you think about trying that again .
uh-huh what would make you put it more into practice again .
yeah .
yeah .
um-hum .
right .
do you think you &apos;ve hit rock bottom now .
uh-huh .
yeah yeah but with a desire it sounds like to really come to terms with this .
am i hearing this correctly or .
i &apos;m hearing somebody that &apos;s telling me that they &apos;ve hit rock bottom that they are really looking inside for the insight and the control that you &apos;ve done it in the past you know maybe a short time but it was a beginning .
what do you think might help you with that .
do you think .
in support of i mean are you thinking .
do you .
you did this the last time that you had this moment where you were able to control your habit it sounds like you were doing it on your own .
were you housed at the time .
was there anything special about where you were at that point .
um-hum .
right .
right .
uh-huh .
um-hum .
yeah .
um-hum .
um-hum .
so the family was really a big part of this your daughter in particular is a big part of your life .
right was this during the period that you had your really good week of thinking about .
yeah yeah well just to sort of wind us up because i know you are anxious to get out of here .
i want to just say that you know i think that there &apos;s some if it &apos;s okay with you i just think that you &apos;ve got the ability there you &apos;ve got that week you know .
if housing is an issue there are shelter groups that are sort of religious based but that might be able to look at giving you some housing while you work on these issues .
because some of the issues that you talk about where you &apos;re thinking about it deep inside and trying to get that control are you know you &apos;ve got that experience you &apos;ve had that moment .
and that &apos;s something to think about .
yeah that &apos;s a good point .
it &apos;s a moment of clarity .
and this is a chance maybe if you want to have that opportunity you could continue to try that again .
uh-huh .
um-hum .
have you used the program across the street or .
arc .
okay .
okay .
well we &apos;re just to kind of clarify with you i &apos;m doing the brief intervention now with you for the study .
but if you do want to come back and work on getting into say across the street or salvation army or there &apos;s an addictions program and actually that &apos;s on the list that joey &apos;s gonna give you .
there are ways to look at some of the treatment that &apos;s around here here &apos;s the harborview addictions program .
but as you establish your care here i can be available to you to talk about some of the other issues to maybe help you reach some of your goals you &apos;ve got .
this is my office here .
i am the medical social worker here when i &apos;m not doing the study here .
so i want you to feel free to you know you can set up a time with me .
because we only have you know you want to get out of here i know .
and then we can continue on if that &apos;s what you want to do .
but back to this part of the study .
you &apos;ve got some deep insight into this i think .
you just need some maybe some more support huh .
here &apos;s where you scored on the dast .
so i &apos;m gonna give that to you just as a little reminder .
now in about a week &apos;s time .
did joey get a phone number for you .
to reach you .
okay do you have a message phone over there .
okay .
well if you want to come back in a week and see me that would be great .
and we could just kind of do a follow-up .
and i &apos;m off on friday and next week monday .
but if you &apos;re around maybe on the twenty eighth or twenty ninth .
why .
oh .
well that might be a good day for you .
it &apos;s a tuesday april twenty eighth .
so you have my phone number .
if you want to come in and see me then maybe i could just kind of check with you again and we can make an appointment if you want to explore some other situations .
so if i don &apos;t hear from you i &apos;m gonna leave you a message at the millionaire &apos;s club .
is that okay .
all right .
thank you very much .
okay today is thursday july thirtieth and i have here lou izelle who prefers to be called violet and i &apos;m just gonna ask violet if it &apos;s okay that we record this session today .
okay great and so this interview starts at eleven forty six i &apos;m sorry eleven fifty nine a m .
okay so well it &apos;s nice to meet you violet .
and thanks again for participating in this study .
i &apos;m here just to talk with you about your drug use .
and i &apos;m not here to judge you in any way or to make you change in any way okay .
so just putting that out front and from the very beginning .
what was the experience like for you out there talking to joey .
.
how did it go .
what was okay about it .
you don &apos;t sound convinced .
okay do you have any reservations .
okay well it can be kinda long i bet .
yeah is that it okay .
yeah you look a little tired today too .
okay .
okay .
okay so yeah that can be challenging i bet too right .
okay so let &apos;s see on the drug alcohol or i &apos;m sorry the drug abuse screening test is also called a d a s t you fell in this range .
it &apos;s a triangle .
moderate risk .
and that means it kind of goes from the bottom to no risk some risk moderate and then severe risk .
and that was according to the questionnaire you filled out .
and so that means you &apos;re at a moderate risk of developing problems related to drug or alcohol use such as maybe medical issues legal all those things okay .
okay what do you think about this score .
do you agree with it or not .
okay .
okay so you believe it should be lower .
okay .
and you &apos;re saying that because you don &apos;t use it frequently .
okay .
okay well how often do you use it .
and what are we talking about as far as your use .
okay .
okay .
okay so you use marijuana about once a week and that &apos;s only around people .
okay so the people you &apos;re around with can you tell me more about that .
i see .
okay so with the coke people you are not with them as often as the weed people .
okay so would you consider the pot more of your use .
more where the problem lies is .
okay okay .
would that be your first choice .
okay .
okay so how often are you using cocaine .
okay .
okay so it looks like here also according to this questionnaire you filled out you also use methadone prescription .
okay .
and .
okay so is that to help you sleep then .
okay .
okay has it always been that way .
pretty much .
okay .
okay how often do you use the methadone and vicodin .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay .
so .
okay .
feeling it does help you function better every day .
okay .
that is not old it &apos;s all relative right .
okay .
so .
i &apos;m hearing you say that there &apos;s some physical pain related to it so .
okay okay so you have some knee problems .
oh okay so your feet also get swollen at times .
mm-hmm .
so how do you think your health is linked to your drug use .
you think there &apos;s a relationship .
okay .
okay so with the vicodin and the methadone do you take only as needed .
okay .
that &apos;s for the pain of your joints and all that okay .
okay .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay so it sounds like it &apos;s pretty chronic and pretty severe physical pain and .
okay .
okay so it really is to manage your pain .
okay .
okay and any other health-related other than your hip your knee .
okay .
okay .
yeah and how long have you been diabetic .
ten fifteen years .
yeah that &apos;s .
okay .
uh-huh .
okay .
okay so genetically you &apos;re predisposed to all these things .
and yeah that &apos;s a tough thing to live with right .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
okay and yeah i mean diabetes is a pretty serious disease and it requires quite a change in the way you eat and just the lifestyle changes .
yeah it &apos;s a tough thing .
but i guess you &apos;re seeing a doctor regularly is that what &apos;s happening .
okay .
okay okay so let &apos;s focus then on marijuana .
since you &apos;re identifying it sort of the problem .
i mean is that .
mm-hmm .
okay .
what do you think are some good things about using marijuana .
and what are some bad things about using it .
okay .
so the pot sort of makes you feel more even keeled and not as depressed and feeling okay about life right .
okay .
okay .
okay .
okay so in that week is it usually a day that it comes on .
or have you noticed when that happens that one time a week .
okay .
okay .
so it &apos;s when you &apos;re visiting with a certain individual that you use it right okay .
but otherwise during the week every day you don &apos;t feel the need to do it .
okay .
mm-hmm .
.
that &apos;s quite a bit .
you were talking about the i guess that would be the bad thing about the smoking the weed right is because .
or would that be a good thing depression .
okay okay .
and what about the negative things about using .
okay so at one time in your life you were hooked on it .
how long ago was .
okay .
okay .
that &apos;s a long time ago .
so what was life back then .
what was that like .
okay .
okay .
right it was so much a part of your life and .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay .
so it sounds like you have some regrets about how it impacted your children .
okay .
so what was it that .
okay .
okay .
okay .
sure .
mm-hmm so what was it that made you decide to stop .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay .
well .
yeah yeah it sounds like you do have a choice though .
you think you think you maybe don &apos;t have a choice it feels like you don &apos;t have a choice .
mm-hmm mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right well accepting is a big deal and it &apos;s a big part of it .
before you can take the next step so .
mm-hmm .
she has diabetes too .
okay but she &apos;s .
okay so she &apos;s got some pretty serious health issues .
okay so you &apos;ve lived long enough and been around long enough to know what it does to your health and .
i mean that &apos;s some insight there violet is .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm mm-hmm and now you &apos;re using it very occasionally .
mm-hmm .
okay .
well how important is using marijuana now say on a scale of one to ten ten is the highest in importance .
would you put it .
okay .
well you &apos;re being honest with yourself and with me .
okay .
okay okay so why not give it a lower number in terms of importance .
okay so you rate it a ten and you don &apos;t see rating it any lower because as you say it you love it .
okay .
okay yeah well it sounds like you &apos;re struggling with a lot and you have serious regrets about the past and you talk about your depression and how that &apos;s linked in to your mood and your using right .
so from quitting cold turkey twenty .
well did you quit cold turkey .
did you say that .
okay .
okay so have you ever had any kind of help before in the past or .
okay .
okay .
have you thought about that or .
okay .
well what do you think what do you think would happen if you don &apos;t make any changes as far as using at this point that you say once a week if you maintained that status quo .
okay .
okay .
okay .
and if the time were right and you were ready to do it what would that look like .
need it because .
are you saying you need it because it really helps you live day to day and .
okay .
okay .
okay .
okay so you can &apos;t even see yourself changing at this point .
mm okay okay .
okay when i &apos;m listening to you though violet i &apos;m seeing that you do have insight to your marijuana use because you talk about your regrets with your kids and how that impacted them so certainly your children are important to you from what i &apos;m hearing you talk about them .
and your health is also important to you .
so those are things you &apos;ve talked about today .
so you might not be ready to change but .
on the other hand you also talk about these other things too that are important to you and you see how it &apos;s linked to your health also .
right .
which is a reason why twenty years ago you were so addicted to it and decided not to do it because of your failing health right .
okay .
okay .
well yeah it sounds like you &apos;ve been through a very hard life .
and you struggle quite a bit .
okay but you &apos;re still here and you &apos;re talking about it and .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so you want to be able to take care of them you &apos;re desperately trying right .
okay .
okay well you &apos;re seeing your doctor which is great .
you &apos;ll remain connected to your doctor .
it &apos;s very important .
um .
and .
yeah so i think you &apos;ve got some choices though violet .
the choices are really you can manage your use once a week .
you can cut down if you want to right .
the other choice is you can eliminate use altogether so you can quit altogether .
and there are certainly places if you feel you need some help that can help you do that .
here &apos;s a resource .
okay yeah that &apos;s for you .
and you know what if you want some more information about marijuana and cocaine and those kinds of drugs certainly i can give that to you .
would you want me to do that .
okay okay .
okay now the other choice you have is not to take risks when you &apos;re using .
so when you &apos;re smoking pot are you taking risks when you &apos;re doing it .
like okay are you .
okay .
.
because there are legal repercussions .
things like don &apos;t drive behind the wheel right when you &apos;re high .
okay .
and then you can utterly make no change that &apos;s your other choice .
okay or seek help that &apos;s your last choice .
so this is one here if you do choose to seek help .
and if you &apos;re still interested i &apos;d love to be able to send you that information just for you if you &apos;re interested in even looking at it if you haven &apos;t .
did you want me to do that .
oh we &apos;re almost done .
but i &apos;ll send it to you .
okay .
what is your address by the way .
mm-hmm .
okay so what i &apos;d love to do is follow up with you with a phone call in about a week .
can i do that .
and what would be a good number .
mm-hmm .
four four six .
okay so this is your cell number .
is there a better time during the day to reach you or .
okay .
yeah .
you told it was a struggle for you to come in this morning right .
okay okay well so the goal is this triangle right .
the goal is to get yourself lower on that triangle so .
yeah so think about it a little bit .
and maybe in a week we can talk about this okay about this triangle some more .
okay .
well yeah think about that some more and exactly what that plan looks like .
okay .
okay excellent .
the time is twelve twenty six this interview concludes .
okay i may be glancing at this every so often to make sure it &apos;s still running .
alright no we appreciate you helping us out with this because naomi is always out in the lobby trying to find patients who can help us out with this so it go okay with you and naomi .
the interview went okay .
any questions about it .
no .
okay well she basically gave me this little dast form drug abuse screening test just to get an idea of your history .
and you mentioned alcohol the pain meds and then just some real infrequent coke and marijuana .
sound about right .
and you indicated you wanted to be abstinent .
not so or .
okay thinking about it is good .
good tell me what you &apos;ve been thinking .
nothing not much .
uh-huh .
oh boy .
okay .
mm-hmm .
do you .
and what did you say helps .
you said something helped you .
oh drinking .
oh i see what you .
so it &apos;s more the alcohol and it &apos;s tied in to making you feel better .
relieving the pain .
not getting enough pain meds .
yeah .
wow what kind of pain are you having .
you name .
different results .
uh-huh .
it &apos;s sounding familiar huh .
no i mean you were saying you used to hear it from the older guys and here you are .
mm .
so can i take the lead that if your pain relief was better you wouldn &apos;t be drinking as much .
is that a safe assumption or .
yeah .
yeah so it ties in like you said .
it does help .
so even hay fever wow .
so you &apos;re finding it helps you in areas .
.
you &apos;re finding a few benefits to it .
so it helps you with various things and you would probably not drink as much though if your pain was under control .
and you weren &apos;t and the homeless is a huge part .
can you tell me about your situation your homeless situation .
what .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
uh-oh .
uh-oh don &apos;t bother .
okay good .
good .
so far .
okay .
right out from under you .
okay .
okay .
wow .
oh .
oh okay .
okay .
okay .
oh .
yeah .
where are you staying at at all .
d s c .
okay .
so everything the homelessness the pain even your allergies is the alcohol helps cope stress pain relief .
oh my gosh .
does the same hold true for the coke and the marijuana .
or is it primarily the alcohol that helps you .
not even worth talking about huh okay .
alright not worth it and so that &apos;s why you &apos;ve done it so infrequently .
okay .
okay .
yeah .
so you have reasons not to mess with that .
yeah yeah .
you mentioned earlier that it &apos;s low on the priority for you and it doesn &apos;t help .
and so otherwise you &apos;re drinking alcohol and then you &apos;ve got the pain meds .
and you need more .
so you &apos;ve kind of like the two are in one depends on the other so far for you .
wow okay and you mentioned it depends on the doc .
so you &apos;re seeing different docs in the same clinic .
no okay the different places you &apos;ve gone okay .
this one is okay .
really wow .
so have you seen the same doc a couple times by now recently .
you got rid of .
okay .
okay okay so she was able to help you with that .
okay .
okay .
so pending that she &apos;s gonna think about the pain meds .
yeah .
you &apos;re obviously doing it for a reason .
mm-hmm .
yeah a flask of whiskey .
yeah .
yeah or bite on this or drink this or .
oh boy well i hope that pans out for you .
you mentioned the d s h s too .
she was gonna help you with the paperwork at all .
the doc .
reverse okay .
mm-hmm .
yeah proactive wow .
so emile when you answered all these questions for naomi you were basically answering them from an alcohol standpoint .
i see okay .
and then just a few yeah you mentioned a few of the others .
but it sounds like from what you &apos;re telling me with the pain relief and some of the other things that help you it &apos;s mainly the alcohol that quote unquote helps you and you say to a degree if you had better pain control you probably wouldn &apos;t drink as much but there &apos;s still other benefits that you &apos;re experiencing from the alcohol .
wow okay yeah i know it &apos;s a catch twenty two .
yeah so well i &apos;ll tell you what too obviously naomi and her team are gonna follow up with you over the course of the year .
you say you see this doctor again on friday .
yeah oh that &apos;s different from this .
okay .
when is that though .
it is friday okay here .
no over there .
okay .
okay okay okay .
yeah yeah .
okay .
okay well i &apos;ll tell you what so naomi is probably gonna check in with you every three months over the course of the year .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m not a leg crosser usually and i .
decided i was going to cross my legs .
i can relate a bit .
oh .
i just wait until it goes away so .
oh yeah yeah yeah .
and i &apos;m no spring chicken emile .
but anyhow so is it okay do you have a way we can get ahold of you .
okay did naomi get that from you .
can i check in with you in about a week .
.
oh .
is it easier that way okay .
about a week or so can we do it then .
what &apos;s that .
oh i thought .
oh you didn &apos;t like my card i thought .
ahh boy .
okay .
yeah .
well you &apos;ve had it long enough right .
was it just recent .
ahh .
no i was gonna say .
what kind of work were you doing .
probably not .
so that &apos;s .
kinda what you were doing .
and you &apos;re thinking there &apos;s a relationship .
wow how long were you doing that .
wow yeah .
.
colors you &apos;ve never seen before wow .
okay .
you have your suspicions .
otherwise .
so it &apos;s your joints you said your shoulder your knee .
wow .
yeah .
wow .
just .
because you know what works right .
oh boy .
yeah yeah .
well check in with me emile especially when you may know more about .
yeah .
yeah .
it &apos;s not .
something i &apos;d like to be able to say no no .
yeah .
i &apos;ll tell naomi naomi did you lose that paperwork .
no you don &apos;t want to tell yeah .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
can i ask your doctor you &apos;re seeing now is she like .
no okay okay .
ahh .
well you &apos;ve been through it man so yeah you &apos;ve been through it .
okay emile yeah let &apos;s check in and definitely when you get your phone okay .
yeah yeah no no just whenever it works for you .
yeah no i &apos;ve given patients those referrals for the free phones yeah .
not that i know of yet yeah .
yeah yeah .
it &apos;s funny i have a friend who got his but not i haven &apos;t actually heard yet about any patients .
yeah .
wow .
okay definitely you &apos;ll know a little bit more then .
yeah .
sounds good .
thanks for your time today .
okay so it looks like it &apos;s off and running .
so thank you again so much for coming in and for being willing to chat with me a little bit .
did you have any questions for me before we get started or .
and how did it go the whole interview process .
okay .
mm .
was she able to kind of explain it in a way that made a little sense .
okay .
alright so like i said today is just gonna be a brief conversation i &apos;m just gonna be chatting a little bit about your drug use and if you &apos;ve seen any positive or negative effects from it .
and so one of the questionnaires that you filled out with us actually is called the drug abuse screening test .
it was pretty early on in the whole list of questions it was kind of a yes or no question .
and so would it be okay with you if i kinda go over what your score was on just the questionnaire .
alright .
so it &apos;s scored on a zero to ten scale with zero being no risk from drug use and then up to ten which means that there could be potential severe risk that people report sometimes from drug use .
risk can mean anything from maybe medical effects or mental health effects or maybe effects that they &apos;ve seen in their lives that might produce a little more risk because of the drug use that they have so .
so on that scale of zero to ten where do you think you might have scored .
okay so you were thinking pretty high up there .
alright and what were some of the reasons why you thought it might be an eight .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay .
okay so you think it might be drug use might be somehow related to health issues that you &apos;re having .
okay .
so you actually scored a five .
and we can kinda look at this together .
so that &apos;s actually in the moderate risk range .
so actually a little bit lower from what you originally thought .
so what are your thoughts about that .
oh i guess were you kind of surprised to hear that the number was a little bit lower .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
okay and so could you tell me a little bit more about your drug use .
okay and smoked crack .
okay and so every day .
okay .
mm .
so it sounds like .
mm .
so it kinda triggers drinking .
okay .
so sort of like the flood gates open a little bit .
okay and sounds like the increase has mainly been because you &apos;re in an environment where people are asking a little bit more mm-hmm .
mm where are you living right now .
pardon .
lions building okay .
and how long have you been living there .
since may .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm and so you said treatment .
okay for .
okay .
mm .
oh wow so even having a stable place to live somehow has increased it because of everything going on around it .
and so how long have you been using crack for .
okay .
and what are some of the things that you &apos;ve enjoyed about using .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
that &apos;s good .
mm and what kind of appointments do you have .
during the week .
oh .
okay .
so are you going to .
are you going to madison .
how often are you going .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm have you been able to have a conversation about that with your madison social worker .
what were some of the things that she said .
okay so she wasn &apos;t sure if there was gonna be any kind of effect .
mm-hmm .
well yeah i mean it sounds good that you &apos;re kind of being proactive and checking in to make sure if there &apos;s gonna be any negative side effects from it .
oh okay .
.
mm-hmm .
so you had mentioned going to treatment recently .
has there been any other times that you &apos;ve tried to quit either drinking or using crack .
mm-hmm .
and so it sounds i could see how that could be tricky of .
you were saying that you can &apos;t necessarily pinpoint what you enjoy about it but that one of the main things is that when you do it you want more and then you &apos;re also in this place where there &apos;s just constantly people that make it really available .
mm-hmm .
.
so again it just sort of almost has the flood gates and things kind of start doing other things a little bit more .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm .
mm-hmm so it &apos;s got you to kind of lose interest in certain things that you were once interested in and also causes some financial issues as well .
but it sounds like also what you were saying was when you have appointments that sort of helps you a little bit in terms of maybe not using right before the appointment or .
things like that .
mm-hmm .
is your payee through madison as well or .
it &apos;s different .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm .
oh .
huh .
that &apos;s strange .
mm .
mm-hmm .
oh wow .
for just a month .
hmm that seems kind of ridiculous .
so how do you feel about the do you feel like you have a pretty good support system here like friends and family .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
did you feel like treatment was pretty helpful for you .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm .
so seems like treatment you felt like was pretty effective and then before you were living in an area where the temptation may just not have been as present but a lot of it just seems centered around the fact that you &apos;re in the neighborhood that you &apos;re in right now .
okay did you have some programs in mind .
oh okay .
is that where you went for treatment before .
okay .
mm-hmm .
okay .
so what were some of the things that you liked about treatment .
mm-hmm .
so having that community having other people that have kind of shared similar experiences was helpful in feeling like maybe you weren &apos;t as alone in what you had gone through as well and the chance to do cool things like make dream catchers too .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so keeping yourself busy kinda out of the building maybe sort of connecting with other people who may not be using as much you think would make more of a difference .
so on a scale of zero to ten zero being not at all and ten being extremely how important would you say it is for you right now to change your drug use .
okay .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm and so one of your primary concerns also is what does it mean in terms of if you &apos;re starting to take your h i v meds and then also using as well .
and so what kind of change do you think you could see in terms of your drug use .
oh yeah i guess so to put it a different way there &apos;s just so many different options that people sometimes have .
so for some people there &apos;s no change kinda continue to use .
for some people it &apos;s cutting down on their use a little bit .
okay .
so not necessarily stopping cold turkey but just sort of .
cutting down more .
okay .
oh okay .
okay so when you &apos;ve completely stopped before you don &apos;t feel any kinda sickness or any kind of craving or anything like that okay .
okay .
and so if you had to choose right now do you feel like then you would want to sort of quit completely or cut down or sort of just .
that &apos;s kind of the point that you &apos;re at right now .
mm where is back home .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
and so how possible is it for you to move home right now .
okay so it &apos;s something that you &apos;re kind of keeping in the back of your mind .
mm .
.
mm-hmm .
so it seems like you &apos;re considering some things of looking into maybe getting back into thunderbird again looking to get out of the environment that you &apos;re living in .
you had mentioned maybe looking into programs at the y w c a i think you said .
babes okay .
mm-hmm .
oh cool .
and you had said also that you have some friends that you feel like they do use so that might be a little tricky .
but you have some friends that also don &apos;t use .
right .
hmm .
yup we are actually .
so did you have any questions for me at all or .
okay well that &apos;s pretty much it just kind of a check-in conversation sort of .
hmm .
oh that &apos;s a good question .
honestly i don &apos;t really know i mean i don &apos;t have a certain viewpoint on it .
it sounds to me like you have a lot of options available to you .
from what you had said it &apos;s really important putting it on a ten it &apos;s really important for you to quit and cut down .
and it sounds like you &apos;ve been thinking a lot about different ways to be able to do that .
which is great .
i mean i think you recognize the things that have helped you in the past so having support .
and you &apos;ve been .
yeah but having the community being around people who you feel like are supportive of you and maybe have gone through similar things sounds like that &apos;s has been very helpful to you .
and then having those options of treatment or getting involved in more activities out at the y w c a .
and even knowing that going back home is an option as well .
it sounds like you have a lot of choices available to you .
so and you sound very motivated about wanting to change .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm and what you had said too is the biggest concern right now seems to also be related to the meds that you &apos;re starting to take as well and not having any negative health effects from using .
so well would it be okay with you .
i &apos;ll go ahead and let it stop .
all right now it &apos;s starting .
so thanks for i know you answered a lot of questions with jessica and for too participating on this study we really appreciate that .
today we &apos;re just gonna have a little conversation about use of substances .
i &apos;m not here to tell you what to do or what you should be doing or what you need to change but just wanna kinda chat a little about that if that &apos;s all right .
so one of the questionnaires that you did is called the drug assessment i forgot what the s stands for screening test .
and it kinda helps assess people &apos;s risk for their use of substances .
and they rate it on a scale of zero to ten with ten being really high risk .
where do you think you might rate .
reefer doesn &apos;t what .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
mm-hmm .
right .
mm-hmm .
it doesn &apos;t do anything .
mm-hmm .
oh .
oh .
mm-hmm .
okay .
all right .
right so it sounds like weed &apos;s the only thing you use .
mm-hmm .
keep going huh .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
how often .
do you usually smoke it .
three or four times a month .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
right .
.
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
right .
is that you .
do you have that disciplined mind .
right .
uh-uh .
oh .
right .
uh-huh .
oh .
send them some money .
mm-hmm .
okay so virgil would you mind telling me a little bit about your disciplined mind .
how do you say i smoke a little and then i stop .
i know when i &apos;ve had enough pop i know when i &apos;ve had enough weed .
mm-hmm .
right .
right .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
but you also were saying you smoke maybe three or four times a month .
so you &apos;re not .
but it sounds like even without the money issue you wouldn &apos;t be smoking all day long .
how come .
but so if you .
.
.
mm .
mm-hmm .
.
right .
mm-hmm .
right .
so why do you smoke it at all .
what &apos;s do you what &apos;s it give you .
good how .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
you feel like the .
the anti-depressant may put you in that state too .
okay .
mm .
right .
so .
hmm .
and .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm .
mm .
what kind of .
medication did he give you .
do you remember .
mm .
mm-hmm .
hmm .
and you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t like those kinda chemical in your body .
mm-hmm .
and yet it sounds like you do have depression at times you .
uh-huh .
mm-hmm .
right .
mm .
right .
hmm .
so does smoking .
weed does that help kind of keep you from having those suicidal thoughts too .
yeah .
hmm so it kinda mellows you out brings you up a little bit .
mm-hmm .
huh .
right .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so what are those .
days in between when you &apos;re smoking .
right .
mm-hmm so the depression medicine that doctor bennett gives you you say you only take it .
so you &apos;re not taking it on a continuous basis .
hmm and he knows that .
mm-hmm .
okay any downsides for you of smoking weed .
mm-hmm .
any negative outcomes for you .
yeah .
how do you know which kind you &apos;re gonna get .
mm .
hmm .
mm-hmm .
so it sounds like you know that there &apos;s a chemical in weed that makes this does this to you .
no i mean .
just naturally there &apos;s a chemical in marijuana that .
mm-hmm .
huh .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
so when you smoke does it keep you from .
you said sometimes it can make you lazy and sleepy .
do you feel like you don &apos;t get things done that you need to get done .
or any other kind of problems for you .
so .
mm-hmm so does that help you kind of maintain your contentment .
mm .
oh .
right .
mm-hmm .
right .
so you don &apos;t smoke the bad weed .
mm-hmm .
right .
so you said you don &apos;t you wanna be able to occasionally use marijuana but you don &apos;t want it to be a habit .
do you feel .
like it &apos;s a habit for you .
mm .
oh .
oh i see .
uh-huh .
okay .
so it keeps you .
so it helps kinda calm you down .
when you get upset .
okay so when you get aggravated it &apos;s a way to kinda mellow you out .
huh well i can understand why you wouldn &apos;t wanna give that up .
yeah so it sounds like you are comfortable with how you &apos;re using the amount you &apos;re using the frequency you &apos;re using you really don &apos;t there &apos;s nothing you &apos;d like to change .
okay .
all right well virgil as i said i &apos;m not here to convince you otherwise i just wanted to kind of discuss it with you a little bit to help kind of clarify .
what i will do is probably try to give you a call in a week or so just to touch base see how things are going see if after our conversation if you &apos;ve thought of anything differently or if you &apos;re wanting to make any other changes .
