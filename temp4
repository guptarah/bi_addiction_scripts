 oh_i i_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_that that_that that_was was_one one_of of_the the_things things_that that_they they_kind kind_of of_look look_for for_.
 huh_.
 and_i i_&apos;ve &apos;ve_came came_in in_and and_i i_told told_my my_counselor counselor_it it_was was_over over_the the_weekend weekend_i i_woke woke_up up_to to_my my_whole whole_left left_side side_was was_paralyzed paralyzed_and and_my my_i i_just just_thought thought_my my_arm arm_went went_to to_sleep sleep_.
 mm-hmm_.
 it_sounds sounds_scary scary_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 yeah_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_got got_to to_be be_freaky freaky_to to_be be_awake awake_for for_the the_whole whole_time time_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 to_get get_your your_liver liver_out out_of of_your your_chest chest_.
 mm_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_little little_more more_than than_just just_numb numb_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 yeah_.
 you_said said_that that_you you_and and_your your_husband husband_have have_been been_using using_for for_about about_twenty twenty_five five_years years_.
 what_are are_some some_of of_the the_things things_that that_you you_like like_about about_it it_.
 the_dope dope_.
 we_can can_save save_the the_husband husband_for for_another another_conversation conversation_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_a a_point point_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_hard hard_to to_trust trust_people people_yeah yeah_.
 in_that that_environment environment_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 it_seems seems_like like_that that_might might_be be_one one_of of_the the_drawbacks drawbacks_though though_right right_of of_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 it_seems seems_tricky tricky_right right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_it it_sort sort_of of_shift shift_.
 it_shifted shifted_for for_you you_now now_from from_something something_that that_might might_have have_been been_more more_like like_fun fun_partying partying_thing thing_to to_now now_the the_way way_you you_described described_it it_as as_kind kind_of of_how how_you you_guys guys_start start_your your_day day_and and_have have_each each_day day_and and_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_routine routine_involved involved_.
 mm-hmm_.
 does_it it_get get_expensive expensive_or or_.
 i_actually actually_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_afraid afraid_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_taken taken_methadone methadone_before before_.
 okay_.
 so_just just_kind kind_of of_wean wean_yourself yourself_off off_.
 i_think think_it it_depends depends_for for_different different_people people_so so_i i_think think_for for_some some_people people_methadone methadone_might might_be be_the the_most most_effective effective_for for_them them_for for_some some_people people_they they_might might_be be_able able_to to_wean wean_themselves themselves_off off_on on_their their_own own_.
 i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_what what_the the_statistics statistics_are are_on on_which which_tends tends_to to_help help_more more_people people_.
 but_i i_think think_everyone everyone_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_little little_different different_and and_.
 so_just just_like like_everyone everyone_is is_i i_think think_at at_a a_different different_point point_too too_with with_their their_lives lives_where where_some some_people people_are are_kinda kinda_happy happy_and and_fine fine_with with_the the_point point_that that_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_with with_the the_amount amount_that that_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_.
 some_people people_want want_to to_cut cut_down down_some some_people people_want want_to to_some some_people people_want want_to to_use use_in in_a a_way way_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_safer safer_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_bunch bunch_of of_other other_varieties varieties_so so_.
 hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 and_what what_were were_you you_using using_before before_that that_.
 mm_and and_as as_you you_were were_describing describing_it it_it it_was was_sort sort_of of_like like_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_might might_have have_been been_kind kind_of of_tricked tricked_into into_that that_situation situation_a a_little little_bit bit_by by_the the_person person_who who_was was_there there_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 so_how how_do do_you you_feel feel_about about_some some_of of_the the_health health_problems problems_that that_are are_going going_on on_for for_you you_right right_now now_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 what_were were_some some_of of_the the_questions questions_you you_were were_asking asking_them them_.
 wow_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 so_the the_overdosing overdosing_isn isn_&apos;t &apos;t_as as_scary scary_but but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_what what_you you_had had_described described_of of_that that_having having_that that_sensation sensation_you you_had had_recently recently_of of_feeling feeling_weird weird_kinda kinda_scary scary_numb numb_yeah yeah_that that_sounds sounds_like like_it it_was was_pretty pretty_terrifying terrifying_.
 huh_seems seems_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_some some_close close_calls calls_some some_scary scary_things things_.
 mm-hmm_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm_scary scary_.
 so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_wondering wondering_what what_was was_going going_on on_in in_your your_head head_at at_the the_time time_when when_that that_was was_happening happening_.
 what_were were_you you_thinking thinking_or or_feeling feeling_.
 mm_.
 oh_.
 to_wear wear_off off_you you_mean mean_.
 yeah_.
 that_is is_.
 incredibly_long long_time time_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_wow wow_.
 so_it it_seems seems_like like_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_seen seen_some some_scary scary_things things_gone gone_through through_some some_scary scary_things things_and and_had had_to to_deal deal_with with_people people_that that_are are_maybe maybe_not not_the the_most most_trustworthy trustworthy_.
 but_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_no no_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 to_look look_for for_oh oh_.
 oh_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_gotta gotta_be be_a a_horrible horrible_thing thing_to to_watch watch_yeah yeah_.
 yeah_.
 when_getting getting_dope dope_becomes becomes_more more_important important_than than_helping helping_save save_someone someone_&apos;s &apos;s_life life_yeah yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 yeah_.
 but_still still_yeah yeah_to to_watch watch_someone someone_do do_something something_like like_that that_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 and_i i_know know_that that_you you_had had_mentioned mentioned_a a_little little_bit bit_earlier earlier_that that_you you_had had_looked looked_into into_methadone methadone_.
 is_that that_something something_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_looking looking_into into_.
 you_said said_yeah yeah_.
 because_of of_the the_heart heart_.
 condition_.
 but_at at_some some_point point_it it_was was_.
 something_that that_you you_were were_interested interested_in in_or or_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 the_.
 private_doctors doctors_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_.
 okay_.
 and_then then_you you_said said_.
 oh_.
 and_you you_.
 and_then then_you you_said said_with with_the the_actual actual_clinics clinics_set set_up up_to to_help help_people people_who who_are are_trying trying_to to_get get_off off_heroin heroin_that that_they they_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_include include_you you_if if_you you_have have_heart heart_problems problems_.
 okay_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_tricky tricky_situation situation_then then_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_.
 you_said said_.
 it_felt felt_like like_there there_were were_bugs bugs_crawling crawling_in in_your your_veins veins_wow wow_.
 mm_.
 yeah_it it_sounds sounds_really really_awful awful_.

 mm_.
 hmm_.
 so_they they_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_to to_go go_through through_yeah yeah_yeah yeah_.
 so_where where_do do_you you_see see_you you_and and_your your_husband husband_in in_five five_years years_&apos; &apos;_time time_.
 mm-hmm_.

 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_seeing seeing_it it_as as_you you_and and_your your_husband husband_five five_years years_from from_now now_still still_gonna gonna_be be_kinda kinda_keeping keeping_it it_the the_same same_.
 and_what what_are are_your your_.
 mm_.
 yeah_it it_sounds sounds_like like_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_much much_more more_health health_complications complications_that that_have have_been been_coming coming_up up_for for_you you_lately lately_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_.
 on_the the_brain brain_yeah yeah_.
 yeah_sure sure_totally totally_.
 well_.
 well_yeah yeah_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_definitely definitely_twenty twenty_minutes minutes_.
 so_would would_it it_be be_okay okay_with with_you you_if if_i i_give give_you you_a a_call call_in in_a a_week week_&apos;s &apos;s_time time_just just_to to_say say_hello hello_.
 okay_.
 doing_right right_and and_wrong wrong_i i_guess guess_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_right right_.
 so_how how_are are_you you_today today_.
 yeah_.
 and_do do_you you_know know_much much_about about_the the_study study_or or_what what_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_or or_.
 no_okay okay_and and_so so_.
 not_too too_much much_.
 and_so so_just just_to to_kinda kinda_the the_basics basics_of of_it it_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_see see_if if_doing doing_a a_brief brief_talk talk_with with_someone someone_like like_this this_makes makes_any any_impact impact_on on_their their_drug drug_use use_and and_then then_in in_turn turn_impact impact_on on_their their_health health_or or_other other_areas areas_of of_their their_life life_.
 but_you you_probably probably_went went_through through_that that_.
 initial_interview interview_was was_about about_an an_hour hour_an an_hour hour_and and_a a_half half_.
 they_asked asked_you you_a a_lot lot_of of_yes yes_or or_no no_kinda kinda_questions questions_about about_your your_health health_legal legal_issues issues_relationships relationships_drug drug_use use_and and_stuff stuff_like like_that that_.
 and_so so_what what_we we_wanna wanna_do do_here here_is is_kinda kinda_shift shift_gears gears_and and_give give_you you_more more_of of_an an_opportunity opportunity_just just_to to_speak speak_about about_how how_drug drug_use use_fits fits_into into_your your_life life_and and_kinda kinda_just just_go go_from from_there there_.
 this_is is_more more_about about_you you_telling telling_me me_making making_me me_understand understand_how how_this this_plays plays_a a_part part_in in_your your_life life_.
 and_as as_a a_topic topic_of of_change change_comes comes_up up_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_this this_isn isn_&apos;t &apos;t_an an_instance instance_where where_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_trying trying_to to_sell sell_you you_on on_anything anything_or or_shove shove_any any_philosophies philosophies_down down_your your_throat throat_or or_anything anything_like like_that that_and and_we we_&apos;ll &apos;ll_just just_keep keep_it it_real real_open open_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_had had_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_wrong wrong_with with_the the_shoulder shoulder_and and_the the_wrists wrists_.
 arthritis_.
 pretty_painful painful_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.
 mm_.
 hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_eating eating_very very_much much_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_marijuana marijuana_really really_serves serves_a a_lot lot_of of_different different_functions functions_for for_you you_.
 it_was was_.
 it_was was_helping helping_you you_sleep sleep_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_helping helping_you you_through through_some some_recent recent_pain pain_and and_also also_helping helping_you you_settle settle_your your_stomach stomach_.
 and_so so_even even_though though_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_these these_allergy allergy_medicines medicines_that that_are are_kinda kinda_helping helping_you you_sleep sleep_a a_little little_bit bit_better better_it it_also also_it it_still still_helps helps_with with_the the_pain pain_and and_digestion digestion_or or_help help_settle settle_your your_stomach stomach_.
 mm-hmm_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_oh oh_okay okay_so so_some some_of of_that that_is is_some some_of of_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_from from_nervousness nervousness_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_that that_.
 oh_okay okay_what what_your your_brain brain_.
 or_your your_mind mind_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_okay okay_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_you you_couldn couldn_&apos;t &apos;t_.
 do_anything anything_.
 oh_man man_.
 that_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_fit fit_you you_very very_well well_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_it it_keeps keeps_you you_active active_but but_helps helps_you you_slow slow_down down_at at_the the_same same_time time_.
 and_so so_in in_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_marijuana marijuana_for for_sleep sleep_pain pain_anxiety anxiety_.
 how_does does_your your_day day_look look_with with_using using_marijuana marijuana_.
 how_does does_it it_fit fit_into into_your your_day day_.
 when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_it it_.
 and_how how_much much_that that_kind kind_of of_stuff stuff_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 i_see see_so so_it it_really really_helps helps_so so_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_using using_it it_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_the the_pain pain_is is_more more_prevalent prevalent_or or_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_focused focused_more more_on on_the the_pain pain_.
 and_then then_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_assuming assuming_that that_interferes interferes_with with_other other_things things_or or_makes makes_the the_pain pain_hurt hurt_more more_or or_.
 it_drags drags_the the_day day_out out_okay okay_.
 okay_and and_so so_this this_helps helps_you you_so so_that that_you you_can can_focus focus_on on_other other_things things_.
 mm-hmm_.
 as_a a_cook cook_.
 as_a a_baker baker_.
 okay_.
 interacting_mingling mingling_and and_stuff stuff_like like_that that_.
 okay_and and_if if_you you_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_marijuana marijuana_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_too too_edgy edgy_to to_.
 yeah_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_a a_little little_more more_irritable irritable_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_like like_withdrawn withdrawn_or or_something something_.

 and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_probably probably_the the_kinda kinda_guy guy_that that_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_that that_way way_because because_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_a a_social social_guy guy_that that_you you_kinda kinda_turn turn_away away_from from_people people_.
 they_notice notice_yeah yeah_.
 yeah_i i_see see_.
 and_almost almost_it it_sounds sounds_like like_in in_a a_sense sense_you you_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_wanna wanna_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_feel feel_like like_you you_were were_burdening burdening_them them_if if_you you_were were_telling telling_them them_about about_all all_your your_pain pain_and and_stuff stuff_so so_.
 okay_.
 oh_okay okay_so so_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_talk talk_about about_it it_.
 you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_an an_outlet outlet_for for_talking talking_about about_your your_tendency tendency_.

 yeah_.
 so_smoking smoking_in in_a a_way way_helps helps_you you_maintain maintain_that that_having having_to to_keep keep_it it_all all_to to_yourself yourself_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 you_feel feel_like like_you you_would would_drink drink_more more_if if_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_smoking smoking_.
 okay_.
 were_you you_trying trying_to to_kinda kinda_.
 like_you you_said said_before before_i i_think think_you you_said said_something something_like like_numb numb_yourself yourself_out out_or or_especially especially_at at_night night_but but_during during_the the_day day_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_working working_just just_to to_keep keep_the the_edge edge_off off_so so_you you_can can_interact interact_with with_people people_.
 right_.
 but_the the_.
 the_okay okay_so so_no no_drinking drinking_at at_work work_.
 but_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_the the_marijuana marijuana_&apos;s &apos;s_for for_.
 and_if if_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_using using_marijuana marijuana_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_using using_alcohol alcohol_to to_achieve achieve_the the_same same_effects effects_at at_least least_at at_night night_.
 yeah_okay okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_.
 don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_it it_to to_be be_a a_finger finger_.
 yeah_.
 so_the the_difference difference_between between_using using_alcohol alcohol_at at_work work_and and_marijuana marijuana_at at_work work_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 yeah_.
 you_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_cut cut_your your_finger finger_off off_with with_marijuana marijuana_.

 mm-hmm_.
 okay_so so_let let_me me_see see_if if_i i_got got_everything everything_that that_we we_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_talking talking_about about_.
 and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_you you_experience experience_a a_lot lot_of of_pain pain_experience experience_some some_problems problems_with with_your your_stomach stomach_both both_because because_of of_anxiety anxiety_and and_because because_of of_medication medication_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_taking taking_and and_also also_being being_at at_work work_being being_edgy edgy_at at_work work_and and_stuff stuff_like like_that that_.
 high_stress stress_.
 right_and and_so so_smoking smoking_marijuana marijuana_in in_a a_sense sense_helps helps_you you_with with_all all_that that_stuff stuff_it it_helps helps_you you_sleep sleep_it it_helps helps_your your_stomach stomach_helps helps_you you_it it_takes takes_off off_the the_edge edge_at at_work work_also also_so so_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_to to_.
 it_helps helps_you you_focus focus_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_right right_you you_said said_that that_.
 it_helps helps_you you_focus focus_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_so so_there there_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_be be_a a_way way_to to_do do_that that_with with_the the_pain pain_that that_you you_have have_or or_.
 mm-hmm_so so_it it_really really_helps helps_you you_be be_able able_to to_do do_things things_that that_you you_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_be be_able able_to to_do do_otherwise otherwise_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.
 yeah_so so_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_really really_adds adds_to to_your your_life life_in in_a a_way way_that that_it it_makes makes_things things_a a_lot lot_more more_manageable manageable_.
 so_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_quite quite_a a_bit bit_of of_positives positives_there there_.
 and_i i_noticed noticed_on on_your your_sheet sheet_here here_it it_said said_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_just just_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_looking looking_more more_at at_controlled controlled_use use_right right_.
 what_do do_you you_mean mean_by by_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 baking_it it_into into_kinda kinda_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_for for_the the_medical medical_marijuana marijuana_.
 oh_okay okay_wow wow_so so_you you_might might_start start_jumping jumping_into into_that that_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_that that_seems seems_maybe maybe_a a_little little_bit bit_better better_or or_different different_than than_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_so so_if if_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_you you_right right_then then_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_about about_not not_using using_it it_so so_recreationally recreationally_and and_also also_trying trying_to to_watch watch_out out_for for_your your_health health_and and_stuff stuff_like like_that that_too too_.
 is_that that_right right_.
 and_what what_is is_it it_about about_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 there_must must_be be_a a_difference difference_between between_using using_it it_.
 i_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_talk talk_today today_.
 recreationally_versus versus_using using_it it_the the_way way_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_it it_.

 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 oh_.
 oh_man man_.

 i_was was_excited excited_you you_were were_from from_michigan michigan_.
 but_so so_yeah yeah_what what_about about_.
 so_there there_was was_something something_different different_between between_then then_and and_now now_where where_you you_were were_getting getting_in in_trouble trouble_where where_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_able able_to to_keep keep_it it_at at_one one_place place_.
 mm-hmm_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_almost almost_something something_maybe maybe_kind kind_of of_rebellious rebellious_about about_it it_before before_but but_you you_it it_almost almost_seems seems_like like_you you_look look_somehow somehow_that that_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_fit fit_into into_your your_life life_now now_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_and and_you you_also also_said said_before before_you you_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_a a_place place_for for_it it_or or_.
 you_can can_keep keep_it it_at at_your your_house house_now now_you you_were were_moving moving_it it_around around_a a_lot lot_before before_.
 okay_so so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_about about_being being_more more_stable stable_too too_that that_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_in in_this this_relationship relationship_where where_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_like like_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_kinda kinda_being being_the the_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_being being_very very_aware aware_of of_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_and and_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 hmm_.
 and_it it_seems seems_like like_that that_you you_are are_interested interested_in in_maintaining maintaining_that that_and and_that that_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 yeah_.
 well_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_cool cool_.
 i_mean mean_it it_sound sound_i i_can can_kinda kinda_just just_hear hear_how how_even even_with with_the the_use use_of of_marijuana marijuana_that that_because because_of of_the the_way way_that that_your your_life life_has has_changed changed_now now_you you_value value_now now_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_changed changed_your your_way way_of of_using using_it it_and and_kinda kinda_viewing viewing_it it_.
 and_you you_were were_saying saying_before before_that that_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_wake wake_up up_with with_a a_burned burned_out out_pipes pipes_and and_stuff stuff_gone gone_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_losing losing_interest interest_in in_alcohol alcohol_.
 and_does does_that that_relate relate_to to_the the_marijuana marijuana_.
 or_does does_that that_relate relate_more more_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_talking talking_about about_what what_your your_goals goals_are are_and and_your your_values values_and and_stuff stuff_.
 oh_okay okay_.
 uh-huh_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 that_is is_cool cool_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_a a_really really_good good_situation situation_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_really really_happy happy_with with_that that_.
 for_the the_first first_time time_in in_how how_long long_.

 so_this this_a a_whole whole_new new_experience experience_.
 well_congratulations congratulations_.

 mm-hmm_well well_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_excellent excellent_.
 yeah_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_coming coming_out out_here here_.

 all_right right_.
 this_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_made made_a a_huge huge_impact impact_on on_you you_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_big big_differences differences_and and_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_a a_lot lot_of of_things things_affecting affecting_how how_you you_view view_for for_one one_drinking drinking_and and_then then_two two_the the_way way_you you_use use_marijuana marijuana_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_used used_it it_for for_a a_long long_time time_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_it it_really really_kinda kinda_more more_of of_a a_mindful mindful_manner manner_using using_it it_for for_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_purpose purpose_to to_it it_.
 has_there there_ever ever_been been_a a_time time_where where_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_an an_interference interference_.
 in_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_pretty pretty_good good_routine routine_with with_it it_.
 has_it it_ever ever_interfered interfered_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_so so_so so_it it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_interfere interfere_with with_activities activities_but but_it it_does does_cost cost_a a_lot lot_of of_money money_.
 you_find find_yourself yourself_spending spending_more more_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_better better_.
 okay_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_so so_you you_know know_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_be be_safer safer_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_safer safer_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_cheaper cheaper_.
 right_.
 oh_i i_see see_.
 keep_you you_buying buying_.
 and_the the_distributors distributors_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_looked looked_into into_it it_they they_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_that that_.
 okay_.
 oh_good good_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_so so_you you_have have_been been_very very_mindful mindful_about about_that that_.
 mm-hmm_i i_wonder wonder_how how_the the_cost cost_has has_affected affected_your your_use use_in in_purchasing purchasing_and and_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_about about_if if_you you_could could_fit fit_it it_in in_or or_not not_how how_it it_fits fits_into into_the the_budget budget_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_like like_oh oh_i i_need need_marijuana marijuana_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_gonna gonna_go go_out out_and and_buy buy_a a_bunch bunch_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_yeah yeah_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_coming coming_straight straight_out out_of of_your your_budget budget_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_a a_little little_something something_extra extra_to to_get get_the the_extra extra_money money_to to_get get_it it_.
 yeah_well well_there there_you you_go go_that that_makes makes_sense sense_.
 okay_well well_the the_last last_thing thing_that that_i i_would would_kinda kinda_run run_through through_is is_just just_kinda kinda_what what_we we_call call_a a_menu menu_of of_options options_.
 just_so so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_not not_making making_assumptions assumptions_about about_what what_your your_decisions decisions_are are_at at_this this_time time_.
 and_let let_me me_see see_if if_i i_can can_remember remember_these these_.
 well_so so_the the_different different_options options_that that_you you_would would_have have_would would_be be_not not_really really_changing changing_anything anything_.
 using_in in_a a_conscious conscious_mindful mindful_kinda kinda_manner manner_.
 quitting_completely completely_.
 seeking_support support_.
 and_let let_me me_see see_if if_i i_can can_think think_of of_the the_other other_one one_.
 i_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_.
 but_you you_kinda kinda_get get_the the_jist jist_.
 mm-hmm_so so_make make_sure sure_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_it it_in in_a a_controlled controlled_manner manner_.
 and_it it_seems seems_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_really really_mindful mindful_about about_it it_.
 are_there there_any any_is is_there there_anything anything_else else_that that_you you_would would_do do_to to_make make_sure sure_that that_you you_continue continue_to to_do do_that that_.
 or_is is_there there_still still_other other_changes changes_that that_you you_would would_make make_where where_it it_would would_be be_like like_oh oh_this this_is is_even even_more more_mindful mindful_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_waiting waiting_for for_how how_that that_medication medication_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_to to_affect affect_you you_and and_so so_based based_on on_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_if if_you you_might might_use use_a a_little little_more more_or or_need need_to to_use use_a a_little little_less less_of of_something something_less less_so so_you you_have have_to to_stay stay_kinda kinda_open open_to to_that that_.
 but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_overall overall_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_pretty pretty_mindful mindful_and and_you you_wanna wanna_make make_sure sure_that that_you you_stay stay_mindful mindful_about about_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_it it_and and_using using_it it_in in_a a_controlled controlled_manner manner_.
 excellent_.
 well_okay okay_and and_how how_was was_this this_for for_you you_.
 maybe_different different_than than_you you_anticipated anticipated_.
 didn_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_what what_to to_expect expect_.

 it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_me me_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_me me_.
 well_we we_definitely definitely_appreciate appreciate_your your_participation participation_.
 and_as as_promised promised_here here_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_gift gift_card card_.
 we_also also_.

 well_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_really really_anything anything_.
 better_late late_than than_never never_right right_.
 well_it it_was was_excellent excellent_meeting meeting_you you_.
 great_well well_enjoy enjoy_the the_little little_bit bit_of of_nice nice_day day_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_left left_and and_.
 oh_that that_sounds sounds_like like_fun fun_.
 alright_i i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_just just_put put_this this_right right_here here_.
 so_appreciate appreciate_you you_coming coming_back back_again again_for for_this this_.
 and_just just_wondering wondering_how how_much much_you you_know know_about about_this this_next next_step step_here here_in in_the the_.

 you_and and_i i_our our_conversation conversation_.
 what_did did_naomi naomi_tell tell_you you_about about_what what_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_talk talk_about about_or or_.
 okay_.
 so_what what_this this_is is_is is_just just_meant meant_to to_be be_kind kind_of of_a a_conversation conversation_between between_you you_and and_i i_about about_your your_drug drug_use use_.
 and_i i_&apos;d &apos;d_kinda kinda_like like_to to_know know_how how_you you_feel feel_about about_it it_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_working working_for for_you you_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_working working_for for_you you_about about_it it_.
 just_sort sort_of of_generally generally_if if_you you_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_mind mind_starting starting_off off_by by_telling telling_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_what what_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_you you_like like_about about_it it_.
 okay_are are_there there_things things_that that_you you_do do_like like_about about_it it_.
 so_you you_like like_the the_high high_but but_it it_increases increases_your your_heart heart_rate rate_and and_it it_costs costs_too too_much much_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_also also_like like_it it_makes makes_you you_just just_you you_feel feel_guilty guilty_.
 it_makes makes_you you_feel feel_badly badly_because because_you you_feel feel_guilty guilty_.
 can_you you_tell tell_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_about about_that that_.
 so_when when_you you_alcohol alcohol_it it_sounds sounds_like like_maybe maybe_impacts impacts_or or_affects affects_your your_thinking thinking_so so_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_maybe maybe_not not_as as_clear clear_about about_the the_consequences consequences_or or_the the_things things_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_about about_it it_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_drinking drinking_.
 alright_.
 so_you you_got got_a a_lot lot_of of_reasons reasons_excuse excuse_me me_to to_not not_use use_crack crack_because because_well well_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_the the_way way_it it_makes makes_you you_feel feel_physically physically_spending spending_too too_much much_money money_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_illegal illegal_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_bad bad_for for_you you_you you_it it_causes causes_health health_problems problems_so so_you you_had had_all all_those those_things things_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_about about_it it_.
 but_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_drinking drinking_maybe maybe_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_thinking thinking_those those_things things_.
 well_what what_do do_you you_think think_you you_might might_do do_about about_that that_.
 yeah_.
 oh_so so_if if_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_drinking drinking_but but_yet yet_you you_had had_it it_was was_all all_around around_you you_you you_had had_those those_same same_people people_offering offering_it it_to to_you you_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_say say_.
 yeah_why why_do do_you you_think think_that that_is is_.
 yeah_why why_do do_you you_think think_though though_it it_is is_you you_would would_react react_differently differently_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_drinking drinking_as as_opposed opposed_to to_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_drinking drinking_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_more more_agreeable agreeable_to to_doing doing_anything anything_suggestible suggestible_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_drinking drinking_.
 yeah_.
 but_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_drinking drinking_you you_think think_more more_clearly clearly_you you_think think_about about_your your_health health_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_being being_more more_responsible responsible_but but_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_drinking drinking_those those_things things_seem seem_to to_disappear disappear_.
 yeah_.
 why_do do_you you_think think_that that_is is_.
 why_do do_you you_think think_the the_alcohol alcohol_has has_that that_effect effect_.
 mm-hmm_.
 what_do do_you you_.
 how_do do_you you_feel feel_.
 about_that that_.
 yeah_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_lot lot_of of_guilt guilt_.
 yeah_and and_guilt guilt_makes makes_you you_feel feel_bad bad_and and_about about_yourself yourself_.
 yeah_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_a a_hard hard_thing thing_to to_have have_to to_live live_with with_every every_day day_.
 what_do do_you you_do do_to to_manage manage_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_so so_what what_do do_you you_do do_to to_stay stay_away away_from from_drinking drinking_.
 so_you you_have have_things things_that that_you you_enjoy enjoy_doing doing_exercise exercise_is is_one one_.
 reading_.
 yeah_.
 and_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_stuff stuff_like like_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_drinking drinking_.
 and_then then_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_tempted tempted_by by_these these_people people_who who_are are_around around_to to_use use_crack crack_.
 yeah_.
 but_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 still_hard hard_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 right_and and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_challenging challenging_too too_when when_you you_see see_it it_when when_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_there there_in in_your your_environment environment_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_in in_your your_mind mind_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_always always_present present_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_temptation temptation_.
 wow_.
 where_do do_you you_live live_.
 not_far far_from from_here here_.
 yeah_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_challenging challenging_because because_that that_type type_of of_thing thing_is is_around around_here here_.
 mm-hmm_.
 but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_do do_the the_right right_thing thing_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_what what_do do_you you_do do_to to_do do_that that_.
 you_mentioned mentioned_some some_things things_already already_.
 mm-hmm_are are_there there_other other_things things_that that_you you_do do_or or_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_found found_to to_be be_helpful helpful_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 how_does does_your your_family family_fit fit_in in_there there_.
 mm-hmm_.
 you_just just_feel feel_kind kind_of of_a a_responsibility responsibility_to to_your your_family family_even even_though though_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_far far_away away_an an_example example_to to_not not_be be_high high_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_just just_from from_the the_little little_that that_we we_&apos;ve &apos;ve_talked talked_here here_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_very very_important important_for for_you you_to to_not not_drink drink_and and_to to_not not_do do_drugs drugs_.
 alright_the the_other other_question question_would would_be be_how how_confident confident_do do_you you_think think_you you_are are_that that_you you_can can_stop stop_using using_crack crack_and and_stop stop_drinking drinking_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_really really_confident confident_.
 how_about about_on on_a a_.
 scale_of of_one one_to to_ten ten_if if_one one_was was_not not_at at_all all_confident confident_and and_ten ten_was was_the the_most most_confident confident_where where_would would_you you_fall fall_in in_that that_.
 okay_so so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_high high_.
 but_.
 but_it it_changes changes_.
 where_.
 where_would would_you you_have have_an an_option option_for for_treatment treatment_.
 okay_.
 do_you you_know know_how how_to to_get get_in in_there there_.
 yeah_my my_a a_a a_counselor counselor_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_here here_.
 okay_she she_could could_help help_you you_.
 and_you you_meet meet_with with_her her_pretty pretty_frequently frequently_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 so_things things_would would_have have_to to_get get_worse worse_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_for for_you you_to to_go go_into into_treatment treatment_.
 you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_them them_.
 to_get get_worse worse_though though_.
 yeah_.
 would_things things_have have_to to_get get_worse worse_for for_you you_to to_go go_to to_treatment treatment_.
 why_is is_that that_.
 because_they they_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_let let_you you_in in_or or_.
 alright_so so_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_go go_back back_just just_briefly briefly_.
 again_because because_it it_sounds sounds_like like_again again_this this_is is_very very_important important_to to_you you_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_lot lot_of of_good good_reasons reasons_to to_not not_use use_drugs drugs_to to_stop stop_drinking drinking_including including_your your_family family_your your_health health_money money_just just_how how_it it_makes makes_you you_feel feel_about about_yourself yourself_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_confident confident_right right_now now_but but_you you_know know_that that_that that_can can_change change_.
 what_would would_it it_take take_for for_your your_confidence confidence_level level_to to_be be_a a_ten ten_.
 what_would would_things things_look look_like like_for for_you you_.
 how_would would_you you_know know_that that_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_even even_more more_sure sure_that that_i i_can can_do do_this this_or or_that that_i i_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 i_wonder wonder_how how_much much_of of_a a_change change_in in_your your_environment environment_would would_help help_like like_if if_you you_were were_able able_to to_find find_a a_new new_area area_of of_town town_to to_live live_in in_or or_.
 yeah_.
 but_from from_what what_i i_understand understand_and and_i i_talked talked_to to_some some_counselors counselors_before before_they they_say say_it it_only only_lasts lasts_for for_about about_ten ten_or or_fifteen fifteen_minutes minutes_.
 the_craving craving_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_getting getting_through through_that that_craving craving_.
 yeah_what what_do do_you you_do do_to to_do do_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_so so_you you_know know_the the_craving craving_is is_gonna gonna_come come_and and_so so_you you_have have_to to_be be_prepared prepared_when when_it it_comes comes_and and_acknowledge acknowledge_this this_is is_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_happening happening_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_having having_this this_craving craving_.
 and_that that_can can_help help_being being_aware aware_of of_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_happening happening_to to_you you_and and_why why_and and_then then_what what_you you_can can_do do_about about_it it_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_quite quite_a a_long long_way way_there there_but but_that that_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_still still_a a_challenge challenge_.
 but_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_good good_support support_and and_some some_options options_.
 what_do do_you you_think think_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_do do_now now_about about_all all_this this_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_plan plan_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 well_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_lot lot_of of_motivation motivation_there there_to to_change change_something something_.
 yeah_and and_i i_wish wish_you you_the the_best best_of of_luck luck_doing doing_it it_.
 i_think think_you you_can can_do do_it it_.
 you_seem seem_pretty pretty_motivated motivated_and and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_good good_resources resources_and and_options options_and and_a a_lot lot_of of_good good_reasons reasons_.
 the_next next_step step_between between_our our_interaction interaction_here here_would would_be be_me me_calling calling_you you_again again_in in_one one_week week_just just_on on_the the_phone phone_just just_to to_kind kind_of of_re-hash re-hash_what what_we we_&apos;ve &apos;ve_just just_talked talked_about about_.

 one_of of_the the_questionnaires questionnaires_that that_you you_filled filled_out out_chris chris_was was_called called_the the_drug drug_abuse abuse_screening screening_test test_.
 and_it it_kind kind_of of_rates rates_people people_&apos;s &apos;s_risk risk_for for_their their_use use_on on_a a_scale scale_from from_zero zero_to to_one one_to to_ten ten_.
 and_is is_was was_just just_wondering wondering_if if_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_kind kind_of of_be be_interested interested_in in_knowing knowing_where where_you you_placed placed_on on_that that_.

 eight_.
 well_you you_came came_out out_a a_seven seven_so so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_close close_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_they they_kind kind_of of_do do_this this_pyramid pyramid_diagram diagram_to to_kind kind_of of_explain explain_or or_to to_show show_.
 and_yeah yeah_you you_were were_up up_here here_kind kind_of of_in in_the the_severe severe_risk risk_category category_at at_least least_according according_to to_that that_test test_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_that that_mean mean_to to_you you_.
 is_that that_how how_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_see see_yourself yourself_too too_.
 mm_okay okay_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_downfall downfall_really really_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_.

 mm-hmm_.
 oh_okay okay_how how_else else_do do_you you_think think_use use_whether whether_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_drugs drugs_drugs drugs_and and_alcohol alcohol_how how_do do_you you_see see_that that_putting putting_you you_at at_risk risk_.
 how_does does_that that_affect affect_your your_life life_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_but but_the the_alcohol alcohol_just just_kind kind_of of_caused caused_you you_to to_not not_think think_straight straight_and and_.
 wow_so so_you you_must must_have have_woke woke_up up_pretty pretty_blitzed blitzed_.
 how_do do_you you_feel feel_about about_all all_your your_use use_.
 end_of of_what what_.
 mm-hmm_.
 for_.
 right_.
 treatment_programs programs_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_remember remember_any any_of of_that that_.
 had_you you_had had_blackouts blackouts_before before_.
 mm-hmm_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_that that_mean mean_to to_you you_.
 how_do do_you you_feel feel_about about_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 what_it it_sounds sounds_like like_as as_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_talking talking_that that_life life_was was_really really_fucked fucked_up up_before before_.
 and_now now_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_quite quite_so so_bad bad_.
 you_said said_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_had had_blackouts blackouts_before before_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kind kind_of of_like like_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_what what_happens happens_.
 they_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_scare scare_you you_anymore anymore_.
 or_are are_you you_concerned concerned_that that_if if_you you_continue continue_to to_drink drink_you you_&apos;ll &apos;ll_black black_out out_and and_again again_take take_stuff stuff_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_even even_really really_being being_aware aware_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_taking taking_.
 how_.
 okay_so so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_one one_concern concern_about about_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_having having_blackouts blackouts_.
 mm-hmm_.
 you_could could_be be_robbed robbed_or or_hurt hurt_or or_maybe maybe_given given_stuff stuff_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_actually actually_taking taking_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_this this_like like_for for_you you_now now_you you_and and_i i_sitting sitting_here here_talking talking_about about_this this_.
 so_the the_buzz buzz_is is_from from_the the_meds meds_not not_from from_alcohol alcohol_or or_anything anything_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_why why_do do_you you_think think_you you_continue continue_to to_drink drink_.
 let_me me_veer veer_away away_from from_drugs drugs_and and_alcohol alcohol_for for_a a_minute minute_.
 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_alluded alluded_to to_kind kind_of of_your your_past past_is is_speckled speckled_with with_all all_kinds kinds_of of_shit shit_going going_down down_.
 and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_hep hep_c c_and and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_diagnosed diagnosed_bipolar bipolar_.
 and_i i_kind kind_of of_get get_this this_sense sense_.
 and_tell tell_me me_if if_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_off off_base base_.
 kind_of of_get get_this this_sense sense_that that_life life_just just_kind kind_of of_sucks sucks_.
 what_do do_you you_want want_different different_for for_your your_life life_.
 mm_.
 well_we we_&apos;d &apos;d_all all_like like_that that_one one_.
 what_do do_you you_think think_would would_give give_you you_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 i_understand understand_that that_.
 right_.
 what_would would_help help_you you_get get_it it_together together_.
 or_what what_is is_it it_you you_need need_to to_get get_together together_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_when when_you you_talked talked_about about_going going_to to_treatment treatment_twelve twelve_times times_you you_were were_talking talking_about about_a a_a a_.
 or_you you_were were_talking talking_about about_in-patient in-patient_treatment treatment_.
 ah_.
 but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_that that_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_it it_for for_you you_anymore anymore_.
 mm_.
 going_regularly regularly_.
 so_chris chris_i i_want want_to to_come come_back back_to to_this this_point point_you you_raised raised_a a_while while_ago ago_.
 because_i i_think think_it it_affects affects_or or_is is_connected connected_to to_your your_decisions decisions_to to_use use_whatever whatever_it it_is is_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_going going_to to_use use_.
 you_said said_part part_of of_you you_has has_this this_oh oh_just just_fuck fuck_it it_attitude attitude_.
 just_do do_whatever whatever_i i_want want_to to_hell hell_with with_it it_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_care care_and and_then then_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_part part_of of_you you_that that_says says_chris chris_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_give give_up up_this this_could could_be be_better better_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_caught caught_between between_those those_two two_.
 mm-hmm_.
 what_do do_you you_need need_.
 if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_like like_a a_teeter teeter_totter totter_what what_do do_you you_need need_on on_the the_side side_where where_it it_says says_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_give give_up up_.
 what_would would_help help_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_.
 somebody_kind kind_of of_coming coming_down down_and and_slopping slopping_you you_on on_the the_head head_.
 if_you you_were were_standing standing_on on_that that_teeter teeter_totter totter_are are_you you_in in_the the_middle middle_.
 are_you you_on on_one one_end end_.
 more_toward toward_one one_end end_or or_the the_other other_.
 or_just just_off off_center center_.
 or_are are_you you_.
 where_are are_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_seeing seeing_too too_i i_feel feel_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kind kind_of of_stepping stepping_toward toward_that that_and and_yet yet_part part_of of_you you_feels feels_like like_oh oh_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_to to_happen happen_can can_i i_trust trust_myself myself_can can_i i_stay stay_on on_this this_side side_of of_center center_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.

 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 do_you you_remember remember_what what_you you_were were_thinking thinking_at at_the the_time time_when when_you you_went went_and and_you you_couldn couldn_&apos;t &apos;t_get get_work work_.
 wow_okay okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 when_you you_say say_you you_smoke smoke_weed weed_daily daily_i i_mean mean_do do_you you_get get_wasted wasted_on on_that that_.
 or_are are_you you_smoking smoking_several several_times times_a a_day day_or or_.

 so_when when_you you_regularly regularly_smoke smoke_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 so_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 what_about about_the the_other other_drugs drugs_that that_you you_take take_off off_and and_on on_the the_methadone methadone_the the_.
 mm-hmm_do do_you you_take take_those those_kinds kinds_of of_things things_regularly regularly_if if_you you_can can_get get_it it_or or_find find_it it_.
 or_was was_that that_just just_kind kind_of of_the the_.
 mm_.
 then_you you_&apos;ll &apos;ll_get get_some some_.
 what_are are_you you_looking looking_for for_when when_you you_take take_that that_whatever whatever_it it_is is_.
 relaxed_you you_.
 so_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_need need_the the_other other_stuff stuff_as as_much much_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_looking looking_for for_that that_okay okay_.

 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 right_.
 okay_so so_what what_i i_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_in in_all all_this this_is is_i i_like like_to to_smoke smoke_weed weed_i i_kind kind_of of_do do_that that_on on_a a_daily daily_basis basis_the the_other other_drugs drugs_the the_xanax xanax_or or_the the_methadone methadone_or or_whatever whatever_else else_it it_is is_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_that that_regularly regularly_and and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_looking looking_for for_it it_maybe maybe_if if_i i_have have_excess excess_money money_or or_boredom boredom_but but_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_kind kind_of of_your your_substance substance_.
 but_the the_alcohol alcohol_is is_kind kind_of of_the the_trigger trigger_that that_fucks fucks_everything everything_up up_that that_if if_you you_drink drink_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_all all_bets bets_are are_off off_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_always always_know know_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_to to_happen happen_or or_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_going going_to to_do do_or or_and and_that that_it it_if if_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_hep hep_c c_though though_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_causing causing_you you_more more_problems problems_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_blackouts blackouts_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_lost lost_days days_and and_time time_and and_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_kind kind_of of_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_and and_it it_makes makes_you you_more more_vulnerable vulnerable_somebody somebody_could could_beat beat_you you_up up_or or_rob rob_you you_or or_give give_you you_something something_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_what what_it it_is is_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_taking taking_.
 and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_wondering wondering_if if_approaching approaching_this this_not not_an an_all all_or or_nothing nothing_.
 kind_of of_like like_you you_said said_sobriety sobriety_the the_way way_i i_define define_it it_.
 if_you you_can can_think think_about about_is is_there there_a a_way way_that that_you you_can can_modify modify_change change_maybe maybe_stop stop_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_if if_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_interested interested_in in_the the_alcohol alcohol_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_even even_thinking thinking_about about_it it_and and_the the_next next_thing thing_you you_knew knew_you you_had had_bought bought_a a_fifth fifth_.
 what_is is_it it_that that_you you_think think_would would_help help_you you_and and_when when_those those_moments moments_come come_up up_say say_no no_i i_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 do_you you_feel feel_like like_you you_can can_stop stop_drinking drinking_without without_antabuse antabuse_.
 you_say say_now now_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_to to_.
 mm-hmm_.

 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 so_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_key key_in in_on on_that that_.
 because_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_trying trying_help help_you you_figure figure_out out_what what_will will_help help_you you_get get_to to_where where_you you_want want_to to_be be_.
 you_kind kind_of of_talk talk_about about_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_to to_drink drink_and and_yet yet_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_this this_spontaneity spontaneity_that that_occurs occurs_when when_the the_next next_thing thing_i i_know know_i i_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_fifth fifth_in in_my my_hand hand_.
 i_know know_sometimes sometimes_things things_seem seem_like like_they they_just just_occur occur_and and_all all_of of_a a_sudden sudden_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_something something_and and_we we_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_how how_we we_got got_there there_.
 but_i i_think think_sometimes sometimes_there there_are are_some some_steps steps_some some_thought thought_processes processes_that that_get get_us us_there there_.
 and_so so_i i_think think_this this_spontaneity spontaneity_thing thing_seems seems_to to_be be_the the_key key_for for_you you_around around_the the_alcohol alcohol_.
 and_so so_if if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_well well_maybe maybe_i i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_just just_go go_get get_a a_fifth fifth_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_being being_able able_to to_kind kind_of of_recognize recognize_that that_that that_thought thought_comes comes_up up_and and_being being_able able_to to_say say_okay okay_let let_me me_think think_through through_do do_i i_really really_want want_to to_do do_that that_what what_am am_i i_going going_to to_get get_from from_it it_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_it it_going going_to to_cost cost_me me_.
 and_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_mean mean_money money_i i_mean mean_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_it it_going going_to to_cost cost_me me_to to_do do_that that_.
 and_is is_there there_another another_way way_i i_can can_in in_other other_words words_give give_yourself yourself_that that_old old_count count_to to_ten ten_before before_you you_act act_kind kind_of of_thing thing_.
 because_that that_kind kind_of of_thing thing_you you_allow allow_yourself yourself_to to_kind kind_of of_think think_through through_things things_to to_see see_is is_that that_really really_what what_i i_want want_to to_do do_.
 have_you you_ever ever_done done_anything anything_like like_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_.
 mm-hmm_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_that that_already already_that that_kind kind_of of_evaluation evaluation_process process_that that_thinking thinking_it it_through through_.
 mm-hmm_.
 wow_okay okay_.
 mm-hmm_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_the the_point point_that that_you you_really really_do do_need need_to to_start start_making making_some some_changes changes_here here_.
 mm-hmm_.
 sure_.
 mm-hmm_.

 not_knowing knowing_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_really really_going going_through through_.
 gees_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_scary scary_.
 i_kind kind_of of_come come_back back_to to_that that_teeter teeter_totter totter_that that_balance balance_thing thing_and and_trying trying_to to_help help_you you_kind kind_of of_think think_through through_what what_are are_the the_things things_that that_you you_need need_to to_help help_keep keep_moving moving_you you_toward toward_that that_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_give give_up up_side side_.
 and_part part_of of_that that_sounds sounds_like like_giving giving_yourself yourself_that that_time time_to to_evaluate evaluate_and and_think think_through through_things things_before before_you you_make make_the the_decision decision_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_just just_acting acting_kind kind_of of_on on_the the_spur spur_of of_the the_moment moment_.
 what_else else_would would_you you_need need_.
 mm-hmm_.
 somebody_.
 exactly_.
 you_said said_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_.
 mm_.
 you_talked talked_about about_needing needing_maybe maybe_getting getting_some some_friends friends_and and_developing developing_some some_kind kind_of of_support support_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 i_hear hear_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 really_.
 and_you you_keep keep_those those_going going_or or_reconnect reconnect_with with_those those_.
 mm-hmm_.
 the_other other_thing thing_i i_hear hear_is is_with with_the the_friends friends_well well_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_almost almost_too too_good good_for for_me me_or or_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_as as_good good_as as_they they_are are_because because_i i_still still_would would_want want_to to_smoke smoke_weed weed_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_an an_all all_or or_nothing nothing_view view_of of_how how_you you_see see_things things_.
 i_think think_realizing realizing_nobody nobody_&apos;s &apos;s_perfect perfect_and and_those those_people people_that that_you you_think think_are are_too too_good good_for for_you you_they they_probably probably_have have_their their_issues issues_too too_.
 and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_being being_able able_to to_kind kind_of of_develop develop_friendships friendships_.
 and_maybe maybe_you you_won won_&apos;t &apos;t_get get_everything everything_from from_one one_person person_but but_you you_can can_get get_some some_kind kind_of of_support support_from from_one one_person person_and and_something something_from from_somebody somebody_else else_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_almost almost_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_kind kind_of of_cut cut_yourself yourself_off off_from from_even even_trying trying_because because_well well_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_quite quite_like like_the the_.
 well_it it_might might_be be_a a_if if_you you_can can_kind kind_of of_say say_well well_i i_may may_not not_be be_quite quite_like like_them them_but but_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_that that_different different_either either_.
 yeah_you you_know know_i i_hear hear_you you_saying saying_i i_need need_to to_move move_toward toward_that that_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_give give_up up_side side_more more_and and_i i_know know_that that_one one_of of_the the_things things_is is_i i_need need_to to_stop stop_the the_alcohol alcohol_because because_that that_really really_gets gets_things things_fucked fucked_up up_big big_time time_.
 and_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_made made_some some_strides strides_in in_that that_.
 as_you you_said said_nine nine_times times_out out_of of_the the_ten ten_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_able able_to to_not not_use use_the the_.
 i_think think_looking looking_at at_what what_else else_would would_help help_you you_keep keep_that that_you you_know know_.
 is_it it_broadening broadening_your your_friendship friendship_network network_so so_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_get get_bored bored_and and_have have_people people_to to_hang hang_out out_and and_do do_things things_with with_and and_talk talk_with with_.
 is_reconnecting reconnecting_with with_a a_a a_or or_something something_like like_that that_even even_though though_you you_may may_not not_get get_everything everything_again again_out out_of of_that that_is is_that that_something something_that that_would would_help help_.
 i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_.
 but_looking looking_at at_what what_would would_kind kind_of of_help help_shore shore_you you_up up_and and_assist assist_you you_.
 you_talked talked_about about_antabuse antabuse_and and_i i_know know_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_had had_a a_somewhat somewhat_jokingly jokingly_somewhat somewhat_serious serious_but but_is is_that that_something something_that that_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_want want_to to_talk talk_to to_your your_doctor doctor_about about_.
 but_looking looking_at at_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_through through_a a_hell hell_of of_a a_lot lot_in in_your your_life life_at at_this this_point point_and and_there there_may may_be be_lots lots_of of_reasons reasons_why why_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_in in_the the_places places_and and_done done_the the_things things_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_.
 but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_this this_point point_and and_i i_hear hear_you you_saying saying_this this_has has_to to_change change_.
 otherwise_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_going going_to to_next next_time time_i i_might might_not not_come come_out out_of of_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 wow_.
 right_.
 and_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_this this_is is_kind kind_of of_getting getting_scared scared_about about_this this_.
 i_believe believe_that that_you you_can can_keep keep_taking taking_those those_steps steps_toward toward_the the_hope hope_end end_of of_the the_spectrum spectrum_.
 we_all all_have have_that that_sometimes sometimes_fuck fuck_it it_attitude attitude_like like_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_worth worth_it it_or or_i i_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_it it_or or_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_worth worth_it it_or or_whatever whatever_it it_is is_.
 but_i i_think think_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_to to_kind kind_of of_remember remember_that that_i i_do do_want want_to to_live live_i i_do do_want want_to to_have have_a a_life life_i i_do do_.
 as_you you_said said_i i_thought thought_it it_was was_a a_wonderful wonderful_way way_you you_said said_it it_.
 i_want want_kind kind_of of_this this_reliable reliable_presence presence_of of_happiness happiness_.

 and_is is_that that_accurate accurate_.
 do_you you_think think_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_possible possible_.
 yeah_i i_was was_wondering wondering_.
 so_you you_want want_to to_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_feeling feeling_totally totally_confident confident_about about_it it_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_thinking thinking_about about_it it_a a_lot lot_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_very very_difficult difficult_for for_you you_because because_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_such such_a a_for for_the the_past past_six six_months months_especially especially_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_such such_a a_big big_part part_of of_your your_life life_.
 the_marijuana marijuana_not not_so so_much much_.

 okay_.
 all_right right_so so_what what_have have_you you_tried tried_so so_far far_michael michael_.
 trying_to to_quit quit_.

 you_were were_gonna gonna_try try_the the_willpower willpower_thing thing_.
 yeah_.
 you_quit quit_cigarettes cigarettes_on on_your your_own own_.
 cold_turkey turkey_.
 wow_.
 but_this this_was was_different different_.
 ah_so so_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_others others_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_seen seen_.
 that_was was_.
 wow_okay okay_.
 and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_yeah yeah_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_often often_hear hear_somebody somebody_say say_they they_like like_it it_.
 i_hear hear_i i_need need_it it_a a_lot lot_or or_it it_helps helps_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_interesting interesting_that that_you you_phrase phrase_it it_that that_way way_.
 and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_how how_you you_feel feel_obviously obviously_.
 and_but but_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_interesting interesting_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_quit quit_the the_cigarettes cigarettes_.
 is_that that_what what_it it_is is_.
 yeah_.
 so_that that_.
 wasn_&apos;t &apos;t_hard hard_because because_it it_tasted tasted_nasty nasty_to to_you you_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_.
 one_of of_those those_folks folks_who who_.
 it_just just_wasn wasn_&apos;t &apos;t_.

 so_still still_it it_was was_more more_that that_you you_just just_were were_itching itching_to to_have have_it it_more more_than than_it it_wasn wasn_&apos;t &apos;t_the the_physical physical_discomfort discomfort_of of_detoxing detoxing_that that_made made_you you_go go_back back_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_you you_just just_constantly constantly_want want_it it_.
 and_nothing nothing_else else_is is_like like_that that_to to_you you_the the_marijuana marijuana_or or_the the_cigarettes cigarettes_obviously obviously_.
 because_nicotine nicotine_addiction addiction_is is_usually usually_real real_tough tough_for for_folks folks_.
 not_for for_you you_though though_.

 wow_.
 it_was was_huh huh_.
 okay_so so_have have_you you_thought thought_about about_treatment treatment_.

 there_&apos;s &apos;s_different different_stages stages_.
 and_it it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_sound sound_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_that that_stage stage_yet yet_where where_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_quite quite_ready ready_to to_take take_the the_action action_.

 okay_.
 and_it it_made made_you you_feel feel_better better_.
 okay_so so_what what_was was_the the_threat threat_that that_was was_approaching approaching_.

 and_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_feel feel_that that_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_happening happening_for for_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 is_that that_something something_.
 that_getting getting_married married_finding finding_the the_right right_people people_is is_that that_something something_you you_want want_.
 you_.
 you_do do_.
 mm-hmm_.
 you_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_what what_to to_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_have have_a a_picture picture_in in_your your_head head_of of_where where_you you_wanna wanna_be be_.
 and_you you_have have_your your_faith faith_that that_kinda kinda_tells tells_you you_where where_you you_wanna wanna_be be_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_.
 okay_it it_really really_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_thought thought_about about_this this_a a_lot lot_.
 so_you you_.
 can_&apos;t &apos;t_give give_up up_anything anything_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_give give_up up_something something_to to_attain attain_this this_goal goal_.
 that_you you_yourself yourself_feel feel_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_in in_you you_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_keeping keeping_you you_from from_going going_after after_this this_goal goal_.

 so_.
 when_you you_think think_about about_this this_goal goal_is is_there there_anything anything_that that_you you_think think_about about_.
 is_there there_ever ever_any any_time time_that that_you you_think think_about about_it it_and and_think think_hey hey_i i_could could_do do_this this_if if_only only_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_made made_some some_sort sort_of of_change change_or or_.
 what_do do_you you_ever ever_see see_yourself yourself_achieving achieving_the the_goal goal_in in_any any_time time_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_about about_this this_.
 it_you you_talk talk_about about_the the_disconnect disconnect_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_just just_wondering wondering_if if_there there_are are_times times_ever ever_when when_you you_think think_about about_your your_goal goal_the the_family family_and and_changing changing_your your_life life_going going_to to_is is_there there_any any_time time_you you_see see_that that_in in_your your_head head_and and_see see_it it_attainable attainable_.
 uh-huh_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_.
 and_how how_could could_it it_happen happen_.
 mm-hmm_.
 now_.
 how_is is_it it_helping helping_you you_.
 how_is is_doing doing_the the_drugs drugs_helping helping_you you_.
 tell_me me_that that_.
 yeah_okay okay_so so_when when_you you_finished finished_the the_treatment treatment_a a_year year_ago ago_did did_you you_have have_any any_time time_half half_a a_year year_ago ago_.
 okay_.
 half_a a_year year_ago ago_you you_finished finished_the the_treatment treatment_and and_you you_came came_out out_and and_what what_happened happened_.
 you_were were_.
 so_let let_me me_understand understand_it it_a a_little little_bit bit_.
 so_when when_you you_think think_about about_your your_life life_dream dream_it it_sounds sounds_like like_which which_is is_the the_family family_and and_the the_connection connection_with with_your your_church church_and and_.
 okay_.
 farm_.
 okay_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_new new_.
 and_when when_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_think think_about about_those those_things things_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_treatment treatment_as as_.
 you_kinda kinda_have have_them them_out out_there there_as as_a a_goal goal_but but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_haven haven_&apos;t &apos;t_ever ever_sorted sorted_out out_the the_ways ways_to to_get get_to to_that that_.
 so_the the_.
 and_the the_goal goal_setting setting_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_treatment treatment_is is_.
 you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_any any_goals goals_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_treatment treatment_you you_yourself yourself_.
 because_you you_sound sound_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_a a_great great_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_great great_ideas ideas_and and_great great_thinking thinking_.
 so_when when_you you_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_it it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_sound sound_like like_you you_participate participate_in in_making making_the the_goals goals_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_treatment treatment_.
 because_you you_kinda kinda_said said_to to_me me_that that_when when_you you_came came_out out_of of_treatment treatment_there there_were were_no no_there there_were were_the the_other other_people people_&apos;s &apos;s_goals goals_and and_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_happy happy_when when_you you_were were_in in_treatment treatment_so so_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 your_.
 other_goals goals_the the_.
 the_good good_goals goals_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_set set_for for_yourself yourself_.
 so_are are_the the_drug drug_goals goals_bad bad_goals goals_.
 let_&apos;s &apos;s_get get_let let_me me_clarify clarify_that that_.
 so_the the_drug drug_use use_is is_aimless aimless_and and_headed headed_for for_a a_wall wall_.
 and_the the_good good_goals goals_are are_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_.
 it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_sound sound_like like_the the_aimless aimless_and and_headed headed_for for_wall wall_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_sound sound_very very_good good_.
 so_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_it it_really really_.
 would_you you_ever ever_change change_it it_.
 that_is is_your your_goal goal_to to_change change_it it_.
 and_how how_would would_you you_do do_it it_.
 without_thinking thinking_about about_the the_a a_a a_or or_people people_setting setting_goals goals_for for_you you_because because_you you_do do_have have_goals goals_you you_clearly clearly_have have_your your_own own_goals goals_.
 right_.
 right_.
 okay_.
 i_.
 i_wanna wanna_hear hear_what what_you you_think think_.
 i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_care care_about about_the the_committee committee_or or_anything anything_because because_yeah yeah_i i_wanna wanna_know know_how how_what what_you you_would would_like like_to to_do do_to to_get get_off off_drugs drugs_.
 excuse_me me_.
 so_when when_you you_go go_back back_to to_the the_church church_and and_in in_the the_fall fall_and and_say say_to to_them them_hey hey_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_here here_i i_want want_the the_help help_i i_want want_the the_support support_are are_you you_still still_gonna gonna_be be_using using_drugs drugs_.
 or_is is_your your_plan plan_to to_go go_back back_there there_not not_using using_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 well_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 good_huh huh_.
 not_exactly exactly_.
 right_.
 who_are are_they they_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_telling telling_this this_to to_.
 the_a a_a a_.
 groups_.
 okay_.
 so_the the_power power_is is_in in_your your_hand hand_.
 in_your your_mind mind_the the_power power_is is_in in_your your_hand hand_.
 in_your your_mind mind_.
 okay_so so_and and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_from from_the the_time time_you you_got got_out out_of of_treatment treatment_six six_months months_ago ago_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_come come_right right_back back_to to_.
 have_you you_come come_back back_to to_where where_you you_were were_using using_drugs drugs_before before_or or_are are_you you_still still_somewhere somewhere_below below_where where_you you_used used_.
 where_when when_did did_you you_last last_use use_the the_most most_.
 drugs_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_when when_was was_the the_last last_time time_you you_used used_some some_meth meth_.
 okay_.
 is_that that_less less_than than_.
 a_year year_ago ago_.
 okay_.
 so_have have_you you_cut cut_back back_on on_your your_own own_.
 is_it it_consciously consciously_cutting cutting_back back_.
 okay_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_good good_.
 do_you you_care care_.
 okay_.
 okay_so so_you you_care care_about about_how how_you you_behave behave_and and_your your_response response_to to_drugs drugs_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 so_tell tell_me me_how how_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_working working_for for_you you_.
 the_slamming slamming_the the_dope dope_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_and and_.
 and_control control_and and_.
 and_being being_able able_to to_live live_in in_society society_.
 so_the the_people people_are are_shunning shunning_you you_even even_though though_you you_feel feel_that that_you you_could could_use use_the the_dope dope_and and_still still_participate participate_in in_society society_.
 okay_.
 but_you you_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_shooting shooting_the the_dope dope_in in_front front_of of_your your_kids kids_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_constantly constantly_arguing arguing_with with_yourself yourself_in in_some some_respect respect_.
 because_it it_feels feels_to to_me me_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_some some_things things_that that_are are_contradictory contradictory_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_yin yin_and and_a a_yang yang_black black_and and_a a_white white_arguing arguing_all all_the the_time time_in in_your your_head head_.
 who_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_win win_.

 oh_.
 what_are are_you you_gonna gonna_do do_tomorrow tomorrow_.
 what_are are_you you_gonna gonna_do do_tomorrow tomorrow_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_different different_from from_today today_.
 okay_.
 even_though though_you you_sound sound_like like_you you_have have_this this_sort sort_of of_goal goal_to to_go go_to to_school school_in in_the the_fall fall_and and_.
 uh-huh_.
 and_what what_will will_happen happen_when when_they they_find find_out out_or or_like like_you you_say say_when when_you you_show show_up up_and and_they they_see see_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_the the_drugs drugs_.
 because_you you_do do_say say_you you_do do_recognize recognize_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_said said_this this_to to_me me_that that_some some_people people_see see_you you_but but_they they_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_see see_you you_because because_all all_they they_see see_is is_maybe maybe_the the_drug drug_use use_and and_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_acting acting_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_and and_is is_that that_gonna gonna_include include_going going_in in_there there_using using_drugs drugs_.
 on_a a_daily daily_basis basis_.
 okay_.
 so_.
 at_some some_point point_it it_sounds sounds_like like_then then_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_cut cut_back back_before before_this this_class class_starts starts_in in_the the_fall fall_.
 you_have have_.
 right_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_well well_derek derek_i i_hope hope_it it_works works_for for_you you_in in_the the_fall fall_.
 i_really really_really really_hope hope_it it_works works_for for_you you_in in_the the_fall fall_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_really really_really really_thought thought_this this_through through_.
 i_mean mean_you you_do do_you you_have have_some some_really really_good good_goals goals_and and_you you_kinda kinda_know know_how how_to to_get get_there there_but but_i i_my my_only only_concern concern_.
 and_may may_i i_express express_my my_only only_concern concern_.
 is_that that_you you_do do_it it_for for_show show_when when_you you_do do_wanna wanna_straighten straighten_up up_you you_do do_it it_for for_show show_for for_other other_people people_and and_not not_.
 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_all all_of of_these these_wonderful wonderful_internalized internalized_thoughts thoughts_.
 but_when when_it it_comes comes_to to_doing doing_something something_that that_might might_get get_you you_to to_the the_goal goal_that that_it it_just just_feels feels_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_put put_on on_the the_show show_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_do do_the the_show show_.
 and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_but but_if if_it it_helps helps_you you_cut cut_back back_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_good good_too too_.
 i_mean mean_i i_just just_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_wanna wanna_know know_how how_to to_internalize internalize_it it_.
 and_i i_think think_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_different different_for for_everybody everybody_.
 but_for for_some some_but but_you you_have have_internalized internalized_your your_beliefs beliefs_your your_religious religious_beliefs beliefs_because because_those those_are are_really really_things things_that that_you you_want want_to to_live live_by by_or or_you you_want want_to to_attain attain_.
 so_somehow somehow_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_internalized internalized_those those_right right_.

 how_did did_that that_happen happen_.
 and_that that_would would_be be_my my_guess guess_is is_the the_same same_way way_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_internalize internalize_the the_next next_step step_.
 whatever_you you_however however_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_internalized internalized_the the_other other_goals goals_and and_dreams dreams_your your_beliefs beliefs_is is_the the_way way_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_need need_to to_maybe maybe_internalize internalize_the the_next next_step step_for for_you you_.
 well_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_good good_.
 and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_all all_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_all all_i i_that that_was was_my my_good good_suggestion suggestion_or or_my my_mediocre mediocre_.
 anyway_so so_this this_is is_yours yours_if if_you you_want want_it it_.
 but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_already already_.
 and_this this_is is_some some_information information_if if_you you_would would_like like_this this_on on_programs programs_around around_here here_that that_jessica jessica_left left_.

 because_that that_was was_the the_next next_topic topic_of of_conversation conversation_.
 so_the the_dast dast_is is_a a_measure measure_of of_risk risk_.
 yeah_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_measure measure_of of_a a_person person_&apos;s &apos;s_risk risk_of of_suffering suffering_negative negative_consequences consequences_as as_a a_result result_of of_their their_substance substance_use use_.

 and_you you_have have_the the_knowledge knowledge_of of_a a_thirty thirty_day day_treatment treatment_program program_inside inside_of of_you you_.
 and_the the_timing timing_right right_now now_is is_not not_your your_life life_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_accommodate accommodate_it it_and and_that that_makes makes_sense sense_.
 so_i i_guess guess_at at_this this_point point_the the_question question_is is_not not_about about_whether whether_you you_are are_clean clean_and and_sober sober_or or_not not_the the_question question_is is_whether whether_or or_not not_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_reduce reduce_your your_risk risk_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_and and_stabilizing stabilizing_your your_life life_is is_gonna gonna_eventually eventually_get get_you you_back back_to to_sobriety sobriety_.
 but_your your_life life_may may_not not_be be_stable stable_and and_you you_could could_still still_reduce reduce_your your_risk risk_in in_regard regard_to to_your your_substance substance_use use_if if_you you_choose choose_to to_continue continue_to to_use use_.
 so_my my_question question_to to_you you_is is_and and_you you_have have_the the_wisdom wisdom_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_the the_answer answer_for for_you you_.
 what_can can_you you_do do_right right_now now_to to_reduce reduce_your your_risk risk_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 well_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_talking talking_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 well_.
 and_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.

 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_okay okay_now now_i i_understand understand_.
 yeah_.
 okay_well well_and and_just just_to to_back back_up up_a a_couple couple_steps steps_about about_what what_you you_were were_talking talking_about about_earlier earlier_.
 i_said said_you you_have have_the the_wisdom wisdom_of of_what what_you you_can can_do do_to to_reduce reduce_your your_risk risk_.
 and_then then_you you_started started_telling telling_me me_what what_you you_do do_you you_started started_talking talking_about about_things things_that that_a a_person person_does does_when when_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_maintain maintain_sobriety sobriety_.
 and_i i_wanna wanna_make make_a a_distinction distinction_between between_sobriety sobriety_and and_harm harm_reduction reduction_.
 okay_.
 and_you you_talked talked_about about_being being_able able_to to_make make_good good_decisions decisions_.
 i_agree agree_people people_can can_make make_good good_decisions decisions_for for_themselves themselves_when when_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_actively actively_using using_in in_order order_to to_reduce reduce_the the_risk risk_of of_negative negative_consequences consequences_.
 so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_talking talking_about about_not not_using using_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_talking talking_about about_in in_spite spite_of of_your your_use use_staying staying_safe safe_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.

 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_well well_.

 well_i i_think think_that that_we we_can can_probably probably_find find_some some_solutions solutions_before before_it it_gets gets_to to_that that_point point_.
 and_so so_at at_this this_point point_i i_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_to to_ask ask_if if_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_open open_to to_hearing hearing_some some_of of_my my_suggestions suggestions_.
 okay_so so_first first_of of_all all_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_a a_lot lot_of of_things things_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_a a_lot lot_of of_things things_well well_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_stay stay_hooked hooked_up up_with with_mental mental_health health_care care_for for_yourself yourself_.

 so_thank thank_you you_.
 what_did did_naomi naomi_tell tell_you you_that that_we we_would would_be be_doing doing_here here_today today_just just_the the_two two_of of_us us_.
 okay_well well_let let_me me_elaborate elaborate_a a_little little_more more_.
 we_&apos;re &apos;re_looking looking_to to_see see_how how_a a_brief brief_conversation conversation_with with_a a_trained trained_person person_whether whether_it it_has has_any any_effect effect_on on_someone someone_&apos;s &apos;s_health health_outcomes outcomes_.
 so_drug drug_and and_alcohol alcohol_use use_is is_one one_of of_them them_the the_services services_that that_people people_use use_here here_at at_the the_hospital hospital_or or_treatment treatment_elsewhere elsewhere_and and_different different_aspects aspects_of of_their their_lives lives_in in_terms terms_of of_health health_and and_employment employment_social social_support support_.
 all_of of_the the_things things_that that_naomi naomi_asked asked_you you_about about_earlier earlier_basically basically_.
 so_you you_and and_i i_are are_just just_gonna gonna_talk talk_here here_for for_up up_to to_thirty thirty_minutes minutes_a a_quick quick_conversation conversation_.
 and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_here here_to to_tell tell_you you_what what_to to_do do_or or_to to_make make_any any_changes changes_.
 if_you you_decide decide_to to_do do_that that_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_totally totally_your your_call call_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_on on_your your_own own_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_actually actually_just just_here here_to to_learn learn_more more_about about_you you_and and_how how_drugs drugs_fit fit_in in_your your_life life_and and_kind kind_of of_get get_a a_picture picture_of of_how how_you you_like like_to to_use use_drugs drugs_or or_things things_you you_like like_or or_dislike dislike_really really_just just_be be_kinda kinda_like like_a a_sounding sounding_board board_to to_listen listen_to to_how how_things things_work work_for for_you you_.
 so_how how_does does_that that_sound sound_.
 okay_.
 so_naomi naomi_mentioned mentioned_that that_in in_the the_past past_three three_days days_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_used used_you you_drank drank_alcohol alcohol_you you_smoke smoke_marijuana marijuana_daily daily_.
 yeah_okay okay_and and_that that_you you_are are_prescribed prescribed_opiates opiates_but but_a a_few few_days days_you you_used used_more more_than than_your your_prescription prescription_and and_.
 vicodin_&apos;s &apos;s_an an_opiate opiate_.


 sounds_bad bad_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_interesting interesting_.
 and_that that_when when_you you_ran ran_out out_of of_your your_vicodin vicodin_prescription prescription_you you_used used_a a_friend friend_&apos;s &apos;s_yeah yeah_somebody somebody_else else_&apos;s &apos;s_oxycodone oxycodone_.
 okay_so so_why why_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_you you_tell tell_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_about about_your your_marijuana marijuana_use use_.
 so_for for_you you_marijuana marijuana_is is_sometimes sometimes_medicine medicine_sometimes sometimes_just just_to to_get get_high high_.
 okay_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_daily daily_thing thing_for for_you you_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_used used_to to_.
 okay_.
 so_by by_nature nature_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_naturally naturally_really really_fast fast_moving moving_and and_mentally mentally_physically physically_and and_it it_benefits benefits_you you_sometimes sometimes_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_working working_but but_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_always always_wanna wanna_feel feel_like like_that that_.
 being_that that_way way_.
 being_that that_active active_has has_done done_.
 so_to to_fix fix_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_turned turned_to to_marijuana marijuana_because because_it it_calms calms_you you_down down_.
 right_.
 calms_you you_down down_more more_than than_you you_want want_.
 so_you you_like like_the the_way way_that that_it it_makes makes_you you_calm calm_gives gives_you you_more more_patience patience_and and_makes makes_you you_tolerate tolerate_more more_but but_.
 makes_you you_a a_little little_cloudy cloudy_.
 okay_.
 kinda_sedating sedating_.
 so_on on_the the_one one_hand hand_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_addressing addressing_your your_needs needs_in in_terms terms_of of_slowing slowing_down down_being being_more more_patient patient_but but_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_problematic problematic_and and_that that_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_function function_the the_way way_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_to to_.
 and_right right_now now_that that_benefits benefits_you you_more more_than than_being being_too too_aggressive aggressive_and and_active active_.
 because_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_gotten gotten_you you_into into_trouble trouble_before before_.
 just_efficient efficient_.
 so_much much_going going_on on_and and_trying trying_to to_get get_stuff stuff_done done_.
 so_you you_started started_taking taking_medication medication_to to_help help_with with_that that_.
 okay_.
 and_that that_was was_from from_your your_p p_c c_p p_.
 your_primary primary_care care_provider provider_.
 dana_.
 okay_.
 and_it it_was was_working working_for for_you you_.
 oh_no no_.
 so_one one_day day_it it_just just_stopped stopped_working working_.
 so_you you_finally finally_could could_focus focus_and and_take take_time time_and and_.
 huh_.
 so_they they_&apos;ve &apos;ve_tried tried_increasing increasing_the the_meds meds_.
 and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_still still_.
 not_helping helping_.
 do_you you_wonder wonder_if if_maybe maybe_your your_previous previous_drug drug_use use_affects affects_the the_way way_your your_body body_&apos;s &apos;s_tolerating tolerating_medications medications_now now_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_an an_interesting interesting_question question_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_wondering wondering_.
 yeah_just just_that that_exactly exactly_.
 hmm_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 a_really really_big big_change change_.
 wow_so so_you you_were were_around around_people people_who who_were were_heavy heavy_users users_.
 so_for for_about about_ten ten_years years_or or_.
 you_used used_to to_like like_using using_crack crack_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_new new_for for_you you_.
 hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.

 they_&apos;re &apos;re_real real_skinny skinny_.
 blew_.
 up_.

 so_they they_were were_fine fine_at at_the the_time time_but but_then then_you you_stop stop_using using_and and_then then_you you_when when_you you_stop stop_using using_you you_have have_all all_these these_negative negative_consequences consequences_.
 huh_.
 so_there there_was was_a a_reason reason_to to_stop stop_.
 yeah_.
 so_you you_think think_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_better better_off off_not not_using using_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_already already_you you_used used_to to_use use_crack crack_cocaine cocaine_and and_you you_were were_running running_around around_with with_people people_who who_were were_so so_far far_gone gone_you you_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_that that_for for_yourself yourself_.
 wow_.
 wow_.
 and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_everywhere everywhere_.
 and_this this_was was_when when_you you_were were_using using_crack crack_.
 but_something something_made made_you you_change change_and and_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_use use_anymore anymore_.
 is_that that_.
 can_you you_tell tell_.
 me_about about_that that_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_really really_big big_change change_to to_make make_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_a a_very very_different different_place place_now now_picking picking_up up_your your_girlfriend girlfriend_a a_car car_and and_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 but_faith faith_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_to to_you you_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 so_your your_legal legal_problems problems_were were_a a_direct direct_result result_of of_using using_.
 sorry_that that_must must_have have_been been_hard hard_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.

 mm_.
 you_knew knew_.
 tired_of of_the the_cycle cycle_.
 like_a a_bad bad_girlfriend girlfriend_.


 okay_.
 i_think think_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_new new_when when_you you_started started_.
 okay_.
 it_sounds sounds_really really_familiar familiar_.
 mm_.
 the_same same_people people_.
 yeah_.
 wow_.

 they_were were_gonna gonna_get get_out out_and and_start start_all all_over over_again again_.
 okay_.
 so_you you_went went_in in_.
 pretty_pessimistic pessimistic_about about_it it_.
 so_you you_were were_expecting expecting_them them_to to_educate educate_you you_.
 about_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.
 but_it it_wasn wasn_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_that that_.

 yeah_.
 it_was was_like like_a a_.
 perfect_fit fit_for for_you you_.
 so_a a_combination combination_of of_their their_program program_being being_a a_good good_fit fit_making making_sense sense_and and_the the_timing timing_that that_you you_were were_just just_ready ready_for for_a a_change change_but but_it it_worked worked_for for_you you_.
 before_that that_.
 mm_.
 shrug_shrug shrug_it it_off off_.
 yeah_.
 and_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_hope hope_that that_.
 that_was was_enough enough_.

 and_is is_it it_.
 worth_it it_to to_me me_.
 decision_making making_.
 yeah_.
 is_it it_worth worth_it it_is is_it it_not not_.
 so_for for_some some_reason reason_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_different different_beast beast_it it_was was_really really_easy easy_for for_you you_to to_say say_yes yes_or or_no no_to to_crack crack_cocaine cocaine_but but_now now_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 socially_acceptable acceptable_.
 alcohol_&apos;s &apos;s_legal legal_.
 yeah_.

 yeah_.
 nobody_thinks thinks_twice twice_or or_questions questions_that that_.
 mm_.
 so_it it_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_affect affect_your your_social social_groups groups_.
 so_it it_is is_a a_different different_beast beast_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_used used_to to_be be_around around_people people_who who_used used_crack crack_and and_you you_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_wanna wanna_be be_like like_them them_.


 so_far far_deep deep_into into_it it_.
 on_your your_way way_down down_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_go go_backwards backwards_now now_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_there there_.
 but_you you_have have_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_no no_longer longer_in in_that that_toilet toilet_bowl bowl_but but_now now_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_a a_place place_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_the the_bathroom bathroom_and and_everyone everyone_in in_your your_everyone everyone_&apos;s &apos;s_in in_the the_bathroom bathroom_using using_coke coke_and and_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_normal normal_.
 yeah_.
 and_you you_probably probably_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_wanna wanna_change change_your your_social social_group group_you you_probably probably_sit sit_with with_your your_friends friends_and and_.
 what_why why_do do_you you_wanna wanna_disassociate disassociate_from from_them them_.
 so_you you_have have_very very_different different_kinda kinda_moral moral_views views_and and_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_yeah yeah_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_how how_you you_feel feel_about about_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_these these_are are_your your_friends friends_now now_or or_just just_people people_you you_have have_known known_for for_a a_long long_time time_have have_been been_through through_thick thick_and and_thin thin_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_necessarily necessarily_people people_you you_would would_choose choose_to to_surround surround_yourself yourself_with with_.
 huh_.
 but_you you_have have_other other_people people_that that_who who_fill fill_that that_role role_for for_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 defaulting_.
 to_these these_buddies buddies_.
 okay_.
 shaking_your your_head head_.
 mm_what what_are are_your your_friends friends_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_their their_drug drug_use use_like like_.
 so_they they_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_use use_crack crack_anymore anymore_okay okay_.
 okay_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_.
 functioning_.
 for_the the_most most_part part_.
 but_again again_.
 not_going going_about about_it it_the the_way way_that that_you you_.
 would_want want_to to_.
 you_just just_wanna wanna_.
 live_authentically authentically_.
 genuine_.
 to_what what_you you_see see_your your_life life_being being_.
 you_just just_wanna wanna_live live_the the_life life_you you_see see_and and_just just_envision envision_for for_yourself yourself_.
 uh-huh_.
 just_to to_have have_an an_honest honest_life life_never never_have have_to to_worry worry_about about_the the_things things_that that_you you_used used_to to_have have_to to_like like_look look_over over_your your_shoulder shoulder_like like_you you_used used_to to_or or_.
 you_can can_sense sense_it it_with with_every every_part part_of of_your your_being being_.
 yeah_it it_sounds sounds_like like_a a_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_have have_a a_really really_solid solid_idea idea_of of_what what_you you_want want_for for_yourself yourself_.
 what_would would_it it_be be_like like_.
 um_.
 interfering_with with_your your_vision vision_of of_your your_future future_.
 so_not not_only only_.
 do_you you_not not_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_picture picture_a a_life life_with with_alcohol alcohol_or or_weed weed_but but_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_also also_affecting affecting_the the_financial financial_picture picture_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_expensive expensive_.
 with_these these_things things_.
 so_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_get get_there there_with with_alcohol alcohol_or or_drugs drugs_in in_your your_life life_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_for for_you you_two two_sixteen sixteen_ounce ounce_cans cans_is is_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_minimal minimal_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_you you_woke woke_up up_.
 here_.
 okay_.
 you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_even even_like like_the the_feeling feeling_of of_it it_.
 okay_.
 they_go go_.
 hand_in in_hand hand_.
 so_you you_probably probably_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_drink drink_if if_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_smoking smoking_pot pot_.
 so_what what_would would_that that_look look_like like_for for_you you_.
 yeah_what what_.
 would_stopping stopping_look look_like like_.
 what_would would_that that_involve involve_.
 what_would would_it it_take take_to to_do do_that that_.
 you_just just_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_.
 the_same same_person person_when when_when when_using using_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 but_alcohol alcohol_and and_marijuana marijuana_are are_different different_because because_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_still still_able able_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_still still_yourself yourself_for for_the the_most most_part part_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_still still_able able_to to_function function_for for_the the_most most_part part_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_socially socially_acceptable acceptable_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_sorry sorry_i i_probably probably_interrupted interrupted_.

 i_do do_that that_too too_.
 well_i i_imagine imagine_with with_crack crack_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_probably probably_not not_around around_it it_as as_often often_anymore anymore_.
 because_you you_mentioned mentioned_your your_group group_of of_friends friends_mostly mostly_use use_alcohol alcohol_and and_pot pot_.
 so_what what_would would_it it_be be_like like_to to_try try_and and_avoid avoid_alcohol alcohol_and and_pot pot_when when_everyone everyone_you you_are are_with with_use use_alcohol alcohol_and and_pot pot_.
 so_you you_couldn couldn_&apos;t &apos;t_still still_hang hang_out out_with with_them them_and and_just just_not not_use use_as as_often often_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_tried tried_that that_but but_you you_just just_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_stick stick_around around_long long_enough enough_because because_you you_&apos;ll &apos;ll_wanna wanna_use use_again again_or or_they they_will will_give give_you you_a a_hard hard_time time_.
 okay_.
 so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_an an_option option_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_down down_that that_road road_.
 i_could could_see see_that that_being being_a a_difficult difficult_choice choice_to to_make make_if if_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_those those_are are_your your_people people_the the_people people_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_around around_all all_the the_time time_.
 not_associating associating_with with_these these_people people_.
 because_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_busy busy_with with_other other_stuff stuff_.
 but_it it_was was_never never_intentional intentional_.

 so_for for_you you_a a_big big_thing thing_will will_be be_if if_and and_when when_you you_decide decide_you you_wanna wanna_try try_not not_using using_marijuana marijuana_or or_if if_you you_wanna wanna_start start_a a_life life_without without_marijuana marijuana_or or_alcohol alcohol_a a_big big_thing thing_for for_you you_will will_be be_changing changing_who who_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_surrounding surrounding_yourself yourself_with with_.
 what_else else_would would_affect affect_using using_do do_you you_think think_.
 yeah_besides besides_just just_the the_people people_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_around around_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_an an_exciting exciting_time time_.

 it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_constant constant_distraction distraction_but but_that that_took took_it it_away away_for for_you you_.
 okay_but but_what what_about about_your your_attitude attitude_you you_mentioned mentioned_.

 you_were were_happy happy_.
 mm-hmm_.
 had_some some_motivation motivation_to to_go go_do do_something something_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_because because_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_getting getting_the the_same same_effects effects_from from_the the_mirtazapine mirtazapine_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_turning turning_to to_marijuana marijuana_because because_it it_.
 okay_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_a a_pacifier pacifier_kinda kinda_.
 yeah_let let_me me_pause pause_it it_.
 so_because because_the the_mirtazapine mirtazapine_hasn hasn_&apos;t &apos;t_been been_working working_marijuana marijuana_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_kind kind_of of_a a_temporary temporary_fix fix_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_in in_the the_past past_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_explored explored_this this_issue issue_with with_your your_doctor doctor_she she_&apos;s &apos;s_always always_prescribed prescribed_something something_to to_help help_out out_.
 what_has has_that that_been been_like like_lately lately_because because_it it_hasn hasn_&apos;t &apos;t_been been_working working_.
 the_the the_new new_dose dose_.
 because_suddenly suddenly_everything everything_was was_calm calm_and and_clear clear_for for_once once_in in_your your_life life_the the_first first_time time_in in_your your_life life_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_hmm hmm_what what_has has_your your_marijuana marijuana_and and_mirtazapine mirtazapine_use use_looked looked_like like_together together_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_curious curious_about about_that that_.
 do_they they_go go_hand hand_in in_hand hand_for for_you you_.
 or_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_mirtazapine mirtazapine_do do_you you_not not_use use_your your_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 may_i i_share share_something something_i i_&apos;ve &apos;ve_learned learned_about about_that that_.
 this_came came_up up_with with_somebody somebody_else else_and and_so so_i i_asked asked_one one_of of_the the_doctors doctors_on on_our our_study study_if if_previous previous_drug drug_use use_would would_affect affect_certain certain_things things_later later_in in_life life_if if_they they_stopped stopped_drug drug_use use_.
 and_he he_seemed seemed_to to_think think_that that_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_the the_case case_.
 and_he he_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_addiction addiction_specialist specialist_over over_at at_.
 h_m m_h h_s s_.
 that_yeah yeah_people people_can can_stop stop_using using_drugs drugs_and and_then then_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_they they_can can_go go_back back_to to_functioning functioning_before before_they they_were were_using using_.
 um_so so_.
 but_if if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_concerned concerned_about about_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_wondering wondering_if if_it it_might might_be be_worth worth_bringing bringing_up up_with with_your your_primary primary_care care_provider provider_.
 what_do do_you you_think think_.
 you_think think_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_you you_could could_talk talk_to to_your your_primary primary_care care_provider provider_about about_.
 you_guys guys_are are_pretty pretty_open open_.
 about_that that_stuff stuff_.
 so_he he_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_pretty pretty_helpful helpful_.
 like_sedating sedating_kinda kinda_.
 makes_you you_cloudy cloudy_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_possible possible_that that_.
 oh_yeah yeah_.

 just_drowning drowning_in in_this this_blanket blanket_.
 so_for for_you you_it it_might might_be be_a a_combination combination_of of_the the_mirtazapine mirtazapine_and and_the the_marijuana marijuana_that that_maybe maybe_isn isn_&apos;t &apos;t_as as_effective effective_as as_it it_used used_to to_be be_.
 yeah_.
 i_can can_imagine imagine_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_so so_far far_done done_with with_marijuana marijuana_.
 okay_.
 well_we we_&apos;ve &apos;ve_talked talked_about about_it it_sounds sounds_like like_marijuana marijuana_had had_a a_place place_for for_you you_and and_currently currently_has has_a a_place place_as as_this this_blanket blanket_safety safety_net net_comforting comforting_but but_not not_helping helping_you you_.
 but_you you_wanna wanna_be be_done done_with with_it it_completely completely_.

 you_were were_saying saying_you you_were were_so so_thankful thankful_.
 mm_.
 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_through through_so so_much much_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_finally finally_getting getting_this this_clarity clarity_.
 to_the the_clarity clarity_.
 you_want want_that that_back back_.
 okay_.
 okay_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_a a_place place_where where_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_ready ready_for for_that that_you you_probably probably_appreciate appreciate_that that_clarity clarity_more more_because because_of of_everything everything_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_through through_and and_having having_never never_had had_that that_for for_the the_past past_forty forty_years years_with with_everything everything_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_through through_so so_.
 okay_.
 so_everything everything_was was_.
 at_your your_fingertips fingertips_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_financially financially_secure secure_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_never never_had had_to to_worry worry_about about_a a_roof roof_over over_your your_head head_.
 wow_.
 okay_.
 so_he he_.
 and_now now_you you_can can_see see_how how_you you_can can_get get_to to_where where_you you_want want_to to_be be_.
 so_you you_want want_it it_so so_badly badly_that that_.
 long_weekend weekend_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_easy easy_to to_fall fall_back back_into into_that that_.
 but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_you you_have have_a a_job job_.
 yeah_it it_sounds sounds_like like_if if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_change change_you you_wanna wanna_make make_you you_have have_the the_willpower willpower_to to_do do_it it_the the_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_it it_for for_crack crack_.
 okay_you you_wanna wanna_take take_that that_.
 oh_no no_gotta gotta_make make_sure sure_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 make_sure sure_nothing nothing_&apos;s &apos;s_on on_fire fire_.
 okay_well well_i i_just just_want want_to to_see see_if if_i i_can can_summarize summarize_it it_sounds sounds_like like_to to_me me_you you_want want_to to_be be_done done_with with_marijuana marijuana_and and_alcohol alcohol_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_already already_made made_some some_pretty pretty_big big_changes changes_in in_your your_life life_having having_stopped stopped_using using_crack crack_.
 so_if if_and and_when when_you you_decide decide_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_really really_ready ready_it it_seems seems_like like_you you_definitely definitely_have have_this this_the the_willpower willpower_and and_your your_faith faith_and and_strength strength_to to_make make_those those_make make_changes changes_.
 but_we we_&apos;ve &apos;ve_talked talked_about about_how how_other other_things things_in in_your your_life life_would would_have have_to to_change change_it it_sounds sounds_like like_your your_social social_group group_right right_now now_would would_make make_it it_really really_difficult difficult_to to_stop stop_.
 and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_i i_know know_we we_also also_explored explored_the the_idea idea_of of_i i_know know_you you_mentioned mentioned_you you_might might_wanna wanna_talk talk_to to_your your_doctor doctor_to to_see see_what what_he he_thinks thinks_about about_the the_marijuana marijuana_and and_the the_mirtazapine mirtazapine_if if_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_affecting affecting_how how_the the_mirtazapine mirtazapine_&apos;s &apos;s_working working_or or_not not_.
 but_you you_think think_it it_is is_.
 but_it it_might might_be be_worth worth_exploring exploring_with with_him him_just just_in in_case case_.
 and_then then_moving moving_forward forward_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_just just_gonna gonna_kinda kinda_see see_how how_it it_goes goes_but but_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_no no_real real_plan plan_at at_this this_point point_to to_you you_know know_stop stop_or or_anything anything_anytime anytime_soon soon_.
 there_is is_so so_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_to to_stop stop_.
 right_.
 would_that that_be be_.
 helpful_for for_you you_.
 you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_be be_going going_to to_church church_every every_day day_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_wanna wanna_have have_more more_of of_a a_life life_outside outside_of of_.
 yeah_.
 okay_so so_we we_&apos;ve &apos;ve_talked talked_about about_some some_options options_.
 can_i i_share share_some some_other other_options options_that that_people people_have have_tried tried_themselves themselves_or or_talked talked_about about_with with_me me_.
 oh_okay okay_.
 okay_well well_this this_can can_be be_really really_quick quick_we we_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_to to_talk talk_about about_it it_all all_.
 and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_totally totally_your your_call call_.
 because_we we_have have_gone gone_over over_a a_lot lot_of of_stuff stuff_today today_so so_.
 but_if if_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_to to_hear hear_i i_can can_share share_a a_couple couple_other other_options options_moving moving_forward forward_.
 so_one one_option option_is is_to to_not not_make make_any any_changes changes_and and_just just_keep keep_using using_the the_same same_way way_that that_you you_have have_been been_.
 but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_really really_what what_you you_wanna wanna_do do_.
 okay_so so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_we we_&apos;ll &apos;ll_take take_that that_off off_the the_table table_.
 another_option option_would would_be be_to to_cut cut_back back_use use_a a_little little_less less_than than_you you_usually usually_do do_or or_use use_in in_situations situations_that that_might might_be be_safer safer_for for_you you_like like_maybe maybe_not not_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_working working_but but_on on_the the_weekends weekends_only only_or or_.
 i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_what what_that that_would would_look look_like like_.
 another_option option_would would_be be_to to_seek seek_treatment treatment_.
 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_through through_that that_before before_for for_the the_crack crack_.
 i_dunno dunno_if if_that that_would would_be be_helpful helpful_to to_you you_marijuana marijuana_or or_alcohol alcohol_but but_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_always always_an an_option option_.
 i_know know_there there_are are_more more_options options_than than_this this_for for_some some_reason reason_i i_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_think think_of of_them them_okay okay_.
 keep_using using_not not_doing doing_anything anything_oh oh_quit quit_completely completely_just just_cold cold_turkey turkey_stop stop_entirely entirely_cut cut_back back_seek seek_treatment treatment_.
 is_there there_anything anything_i i_&apos;ve &apos;ve_left left_off off_that that_is is_a a_potential potential_option option_.
 okay_so so_those those_are are_what what_do do_you you_think think_about about_all all_of of_those those_.
 cold_turkey turkey_.
 yeah_i i_like like_it it_.
 toilet_bowl bowl_.
 dive_in in_.

 yeah_.
 you_have have_to to_.
 be_ready ready_and and_then then_you you_&apos;ll &apos;ll_go go_and and_then then_you you_&apos;ll &apos;ll_jump jump_in in_.

 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_going going_to to_walk walk_in in_an an_inch inch_at at_a a_time time_.
 cutting_back back_.
 okay_.
 so_you you_know know_that that_that that_won won_&apos;t &apos;t_work work_for for_you you_.
 okay_.
 and_for for_you you_you you_see see_that that_without without_help help_from from_other other_people people_.
 with_help help_.
 okay_.
 what_would would_the the_help help_.

 okay_so so_but but_you you_have have_a a_plan plan_then then_.

 get_everyone everyone_on on_board board_help help_me me_hold hold_myself myself_accountable accountable_.
 and_if if_they they_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_support support_you you_.
 okay_.
 so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_it it_would would_look look_like like_for for_you you_.
 you_like like_you you_.
 feel_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_closer closer_and and_closer closer_to to_getting getting_ready ready_.
 mm_.
 well_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_really really_glad glad_we we_had had_the the_chance chance_to to_talk talk_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_have have_a a_solid solid_idea idea_but but_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_quitting quitting_would would_look look_like like_for for_you you_in in_terms terms_of of_deciding deciding_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_ready ready_and and_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_ready ready_telling telling_all all_of of_your your_people people_look look_this this_is is_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_happening happening_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_making making_these these_changes changes_and and_then then_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_just just_at at_a a_point point_now now_where where_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_closer closer_and and_closer closer_to to_that that_day day_.
 right_.
 okay_.
 yeah_so so_do do_you you_have have_a a_timeline timeline_for for_when when_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_to to_see see_yourself yourself_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_still still_taking taking_it it_day day_by by_day day_.
 okay_.
 yeah_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_there there_yet yet_today today_but but_you you_could could_be be_there there_any any_day day_now now_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_would would_want want_an an_instant instant_remedy remedy_to to_help help_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 hmm_.

 well_thank thank_you you_.
 yeah_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_sorry sorry_.
 well_i i_really really_thank thank_you you_for for_taking taking_the the_time time_to to_do do_this this_.
 would_it it_be be_okay okay_with with_you you_if if_i i_follow follow_up up_in in_a a_week week_up up_to to_you you_just just_check check_in in_and and_see see_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_.

 okay_.
 okay_would would_are are_certain certain_days days_better better_than than_others others_or or_.
 okay_okay okay_so so_urbano urbano_first first_i i_want want_to to_talk talk_to to_you you_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_what what_you you_did did_today today_and and_learn learn_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_about about_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_on on_for for_you you_.
 and_then then_of of_course course_alicia alicia_informed informed_me me_that that_you you_told told_your your_doctor doctor_you you_really really_want want_treatment treatment_.

 oh_really really_.
 yeah_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_great great_.
 okay_so so_one one_of of_the the_things things_that that_you you_did did_today today_was was_a a_screening screening_tool tool_called called_the the_dast dast_drug drug_abuse abuse_screening screening_tool tool_.
 and_it it_measures measures_the the_risk risk_of of_harm harm_that that_a a_person person_might might_experience experience_due due_to to_their their_substance substance_use use_.
 and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_on on_a a_scale scale_of of_zero zero_to to_ten ten_zero zero_being being_no no_risk risk_of of_harm harm_ten ten_being being_extreme extreme_or or_severe severe_risk risk_of of_harm harm_.
 where_do do_you you_think think_you you_fell fell_on on_that that_zero zero_to to_ten ten_scale scale_.
 okay_you you_actually actually_scored scored_a a_six six_.
 but_you you_know know_what what_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_still still_within within_that that_same same_range range_.
 so_whether whether_it it_was was_six six_or or_eight eight_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_still still_be be_in in_that that_top top_category category_.
 so_tell tell_me me_why why_you you_said said_eight eight_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_on on_that that_makes makes_you you_feel feel_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_severe severe_risk risk_.
 uh-huh_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_tired tired_of of_drug drug_use use_.

 is_that that_what what_you you_said said_.

 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 okay_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_really really_clear clear_that that_you you_wanna wanna_stop stop_.

 or_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_goal goal_.
 you_wanna wanna_stop stop_.
 okay_what what_do do_you you_think think_is is_gonna gonna_be be_most most_helpful helpful_to to_you you_achieving achieving_that that_goal goal_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 okay_so so_do do_you you_think think_you you_need need_to to_go go_back back_to to_a a_formal formal_treatment treatment_program program_.
 what_kind kind_of of_medication medication_.
 oh_yeah yeah_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_hard hard_.
 yeah_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_yeah yeah_yeah yeah_suboxone suboxone_programs programs_are are_far far_and and_few few_between between_.
 and_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_lot lot_of of_criteria criteria_to to_get get_into into_a a_suboxone suboxone_program program_.
 but_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_mostly mostly_interested interested_in in_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 so_not not_methadone methadone_maintenance maintenance_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 okay_have have_you you_ever ever_talked talked_to to_a a_doctor doctor_about about_that that_.
 because_the the_first first_thing thing_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_curious curious_about about_when when_you you_tell tell_me me_you you_see see_a a_lot lot_of of_people people_on on_oxygen oxygen_i i_just just_wonder wonder_if if_they they_were were_probably probably_smoking smoking_for for_a a_lot lot_of of_years years_in in_addition addition_to to_using using_and and_it it_just just_might might_be be_a a_coincidence coincidence_that that_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 and_i i_certainly certainly_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_wanna wanna_sound sound_like like_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_trying trying_to to_talk talk_you you_into into_that that_because because_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_here here_to to_talk talk_you you_into into_anything anything_.
 i_just just_kinda kinda_wanna wanna_explore explore_that that_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_.
 okay_you you_want want_suboxone suboxone_.
 no_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_okay okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_okay okay_so so_suboxone suboxone_or or_methadone methadone_if if_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_willing willing_to to_put put_you you_on on_a a_lower lower_dose dose_than than_sixty sixty_.
 and_then then_would would_your your_goal goal_be be_to to_taper taper_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 i_hear hear_you you_.
 okay_so so_that that_i i_can can_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_that that_with with_a a_lot lot_of of_strength strength_so so_i i_can can_tell tell_that that_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_you you_really really_want want_you you_really really_wanna wanna_be be_off off_medication medication_.
 okay_well well_i i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_tell tell_you you_what what_i i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_do do_i i_will will_.
 i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_very very_much much_about about_suboxone suboxone_i i_gotta gotta_be be_honest honest_.
 but_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_happy happy_to to_look look_and and_see see_what what_i i_can can_learn learn_today today_.
 and_then then_we we_can can_go go_down down_that that_road road_and and_if if_it it_looks looks_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_feasible feasible_we we_can can_get get_you you_started started_.
 the_other other_thing thing_is is_this this_is is_not not_something something_that that_is is_probably probably_gonna gonna_be be_immediately immediately_put put_in in_place place_today today_.
 so_.
 so_we we_have have_a a_c c_d d_counselor counselor_here here_in in_clinic clinic_that that_i i_can can_set set_you you_up up_to to_follow follow_up up_with with_if if_you you_think think_that that_might might_be be_helpful helpful_.
 do_you you_wanna wanna_do do_that that_.
 okay_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_up up_to to_you you_.
 if_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_be be_helpful helpful_.
 okay_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_see see_.
 chemical_dependency dependency_.
 so_she she_would would_be be_a a_counselor counselor_who who_would would_offer offer_support support_follow follow_up up_on on_what what_we we_start start_today today_.
 okay_.
 okay_i i_think think_i i_just just_have have_to to_.
 let_me me_also also_look look_into into_my my_trails trails_to to_treatment treatment_.
 i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_if if_it it_has has_anything anything_on on_suboxone suboxone_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_little little_bit bit_outdated outdated_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_insurance insurance_.
 okay_.
 so_you you_have have_a a_medical medical_coupon coupon_.
 which_program program_are are_you you_on on_.
 is_this this_it it_.
 okay_.
 it_looks looks_like like_yeah yeah_.
 okay_so so_you you_must must_receive receive_do do_you you_receive receive_medicare medicare_and and_then then_sometimes sometimes_receive receive_medicaid medicaid_.
 and_do do_you you_know know_what what_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_spendown spendown_it it_.
 it_looks looks_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_on on_.
 yeah_.
 so_your your_spend spend_on on_six six_hundred hundred_.
 so_as as_soon soon_as as_you you_.
 accrue_six six_hundred hundred_in in_medical medical_bills bills_you you_get get_on on_medicaid medicaid_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_let let_me me_see see_.
 yeah_this this_talks talks_about about_methadone methadone_it it_talks talks_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_buprenorphine buprenorphine_.
 suboxone_.
 yup_.
 but_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_telling telling_me me_about about_suboxone suboxone_or or_buprenorphine buprenorphine_.
 programs_.
 yeah_well well_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_medication medication_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_around around_for for_a a_while while_but but_they they_&apos;ve &apos;ve_just just_been been_recently recently_using using_it it_more more_for for_opiate opiate_replacement replacement_therapy therapy_.
 and_again again_i i_know know_more more_about about_methadone methadone_than than_i i_do do_about about_suboxone suboxone_.
 so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_kinda kinda_and and_this this_is is_what what_happens happens_all all_the the_time time_a a_patient patient_comes comes_in in_and and_they they_ask ask_me me_about about_something something_and and_i i_may may_not not_know know_about about_it it_.
 and_so so_i i_have have_to to_educate educate_myself myself_while while_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_working working_with with_a a_patient patient_.
 so_my my_trails trails_to to_treatment treatment_is is_not not_very very_helpful helpful_.

 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 where_are are_you you_on on_a a_waiting waiting_list list_.
 okay_.
 and_these these_are are_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_sorry sorry_.
 right_.
 are_these these_treatment treatment_programs programs_are are_ones ones_that that_involve involve_include include_housing housing_.
 is_that that_right right_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_.
 yeah_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_the the_right right_things things_to to_get get_involved involved_in in_those those_programs programs_.
 and_i i_know know_as as_you you_say say_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_frustrating frustrating_because because_sometimes sometimes_it it_can can_take take_a a_little little_bit bit_of of_time time_to to_get get_in in_.
 mm-hmm_.
 any_other other_ideas ideas_about about_where where_to to_get get_the the_kinda kinda_support support_you you_need need_or or_how how_to to_get get_involved involved_in in_treatment treatment_.
 mm-hmm_.
 where_&apos;s &apos;s_this this_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_kinda kinda_the the_best best_time time_to to_go go_is is_when when_.
 yeah_.
 because_those those_are are_the the_times times_when when_you you_may may_feel feel_discouraged discouraged_.
 mm-hmm_.
 good_well well_i i_certainly certainly_find find_that that_encouraging encouraging_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_giving giving_up up_.
 and_i i_can can_hope hope_maybe maybe_accept accept_some some_of of_that that_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_discouraged discouraged_that that_you you_have have_got got_a a_lot lot_of of_motivation motivation_for for_change change_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_what what_you you_need need_to to_do do_.
 i_was was_wondering wondering_because because_you you_did did_all all_that that_paperwork paperwork_and and_part part_of of_that that_paperwork paperwork_was was_the the_screening screening_test test_.
 which_scores scores_people people_on on_kind kind_of of_a a_severity severity_or or_risk risk_scale scale_here here_.
 and_just just_so so_i i_can can_share share_this this_with with_you you_just just_so so_you you_know know_just just_for for_your your_information information_this this_test test_that that_you you_took took_was was_given given_to to_thousands thousands_and and_thousands thousands_of of_people people_.
 and_then then_they they_people people_their their_risk risk_their their_risk risk_for for_harm harm_due due_to to_their their_drug drug_uses uses_is is_rated rated_on on_this this_scale scale_from from_one one_to to_ten ten_or or_zero zero_to to_ten ten_.
 zero_is is_no no_risk risk_and and_it it_kinda kinda_goes goes_up up_and and_you you_can can_look look_at at_it it_one one_to to_two two_is is_some some_risk risk_three three_to to_five five_&apos;s &apos;s_moderate moderate_risk risk_and and_six six_to to_ten ten_&apos;s &apos;s_severe severe_risk risk_.
 and_in in_terms terms_of of_risk risk_they they_mean mean_problems problems_that that_you you_may may_have have_medically medically_injuries injuries_to to_yourself yourself_mental mental_health health_emotional emotional_consequences consequences_.
 and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_talked talked_to to_me me_already already_about about_some some_of of_these these_consequences consequences_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_experienced experienced_.
 but_in in_terms terms_of of_your your_score score_your your_score score_was was_a a_nine nine_which which_put put_you you_up up_in in_the the_severe severe_risk risk_rating rating_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_already already_have have_a a_sense sense_of of_that that_to to_me me_.
 yeah_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_ready ready_to to_make make_a a_change change_and and_i i_tell tell_you you_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_the the_things things_that that_you you_need need_to to_do do_.
 um_.
 well_i i_.
 tell_you you_we we_do do_.
 i_think think_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_an an_appointment appointment_here here_with with_in in_the the_adult adult_medicine medicine_clinic clinic_.
 and_the the_adult adult_medicine medicine_clinic clinic_here here_has has_some some_chemical chemical_dependency dependency_counselors counselors_and and_you you_could could_talk talk_with with_them them_.

 stay_involved involved_.
 and_we we_&apos;ll &apos;ll_figure figure_something something_out out_.
 all_right right_have have_a a_nice nice_day day_.
 alright_so so_it it_looks looks_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_up up_and and_running running_.
 okay_so so_i i_know know_that that_you you_like like_i i_mentioned mentioned_answered answered_a a_lot lot_questions questions_.
 oh_did did_you you_need need_to to_.
 take_it it_.
 okay_.
 so_i i_know know_that that_you you_went went_through through_a a_bunch bunch_of of_different different_questions questions_with with_leah leah_.
 and_the the_first first_set set_of of_questions questions_were were_kinda kinda_like like_yes yes_or or_no no_questions questions_about about_drug drug_use use_.
 and_so so_i i_was was_wondering wondering_sort sort_of of_what what_thoughts thoughts_might might_have have_come come_up up_for for_you you_as as_you you_were were_answering answering_those those_questions questions_or or_.
 mm-hmm_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_.
 hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_they they_caught caught_him him_okay okay_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 and_third third_one one_was was_supposed supposed_to to_be be_yesterday yesterday_but but_the the_counselor counselor_laura laura_she she_has has_to to_cancel cancel_it it_because because_she she_wasn wasn_&apos;t &apos;t_feeling feeling_good good_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_.
 okay_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 so_given given_what what_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_described described_just just_going going_through through_so so_much much_having having_yeah yeah_i i_mean mean_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_parents parents_&apos; &apos;_worst worst_fear fear_right right_.
 and_then then_on on_top top_of of_that that_relationship relationship_dynamics dynamics_.

 yeah_and and_maybe maybe_too too_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_also also_saying saying_that that_you you_feel feel_isolated isolated_and and_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_have have_the the_support support_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_had had_hit hit_a a_point point_too too_where where_you you_felt felt_so so_overwhelmed overwhelmed_that that_you you_actually actually_ended ended_up up_taking taking_some some_tylenol tylenol_and and_ending ending_up up_in in_the the_hospital hospital_.
 so_obviously obviously_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_seen seen_really really_a a_lot lot_of of_anxiety anxiety_right right_.
 yeah_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_lot lot_to to_deal deal_with with_sure sure_.
 and_so so_i i_think think_you you_had had_mentioned mentioned_smoking smoking_marijuana marijuana_.
 so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_substance substance_the the_main main_substance substance_you you_use use_.
 okay_and and_anything anything_else else_or or_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_so so_.
 for_.
 and_so so_you you_had had_mentioned mentioned_that that_on on_the the_one one_hand hand_it it_helps helps_with with_your your_anxiety anxiety_but but_you you_also also_notice notice_it it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_make make_the the_problem problem_go go_away away_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_a a_numbing numbing_.
 kind_of of_a a_distraction distraction_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_a a_little little_overwhelmed overwhelmed_.
 and_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_one one_of of_the the_things things_that that_sort sort_of of_feels feels_good good_about about_it it_.
 is_there there_anything anything_else else_about about_smoking smoking_that that_you you_sort sort_of of_feels feels_good good_for for_you you_.
 okay_in in_terms terms_of of_any any_drawbacks drawbacks_have have_you you_seen seen_any any_kinda kinda_negative negative_sides sides_to to_it it_or or_.
 okay_so so_for for_you you_its its_just just_main main_concern concern_then then_is is_that that_the the_problem problem_is is_still still_there there_.
 mm_.
 and_you you_said said_that that_you you_guys guys_have have_started started_counseling counseling_.
 okay_.
 okay_and and_do do_you you_feel feel_like like_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_helping helping_out out_a a_little little_bit bit_in in_terms terms_with with_your your_anxiety anxiety_as as_well well_.
 okay_.
 so_the the_beginning beginning_stages stages_still still_.
 kind_of of_like like_a a_meet meet_greet greet_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_meeting meeting_with with_a a_counselor counselor_to to_sort sort_of of_come come_up up_with with_a a_plan plan_that that_you you_and and_your your_kids kids_&apos; &apos;_dad dad_can can_kind kind_of of_put put_together together_.
 so_i i_guess guess_given given_that that_you you_describe describe_sort sort_of of_when when_you you_smoke smoke_it it_really really_helps helps_with with_your your_anxiety anxiety_.
 how_do do_you you_think think_things things_would would_be be_different different_if if_your your_anxiety anxiety_was was_more more_something something_that that_you you_felt felt_like like_you you_had had_control control_over over_.
 you_would would_totally totally_.
 okay_.
 so_for for_you you_at at_this this_point point_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_sometimes sometimes_people people_describe describe_it it_as as_a a_recreational recreational_thing thing_.
 but_for for_you you_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_almost almost_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_medicating medicating_anxiety anxiety_but but_if if_you you_saw saw_yourself yourself_with with_less less_anxiety anxiety_then then_marijuana marijuana_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_be be_as as_necessary necessary_.
 okay_and and_i i_guess guess_where where_do do_you you_see see_you you_and and_your your_family family_in in_five five_years years_&apos; &apos;_time time_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_well well_yeah yeah_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_very very_clear clear_how how_much much_love love_and and_attention attention_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_given given_to to_your your_family family_and and_how how_important important_they they_are are_good good_for for_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_and and_i i_think think_the the_fact fact_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_services services_and and_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_figure figure_out out_as as_a a_family family_how how_to to_support support_her her_is is_huge huge_.
 i_think think_that that_actually actually_helps helps_a a_lot lot_when when_kids kids_report report_having having_a a_situation situation_that that_they they_&apos;ve &apos;ve_experienced experienced_like like_that that_that that_can can_be be_upsetting upsetting_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 yeah_i i_can can_see see_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_very very_yeah yeah_very very_painful painful_difficult difficult_topic topic_.
 but_and and_i i_can can_also also_see see_how how_much much_you you_guys guys_are are_really really_trying trying_to to_pull pull_together together_to to_support support_her her_which which_i i_think think_is is_wonderful wonderful_.
 yeah_.
 and_i i_think think_again again_unfortunetly unfortunetly_abuse abuse_can can_happen happen_but but_to to_have have_the the_love love_and and_support support_of of_family family_and and_that that_structure structure_is is_a a_really really_huge huge_protective protective_thing thing_for for_a a_lot lot_of of_kids kids_.
 so_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_great great_that that_she she_did did_talk talk_to to_you you_guys guys_about about_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 and_so so_do do_you you_feel feel_like like_the the_counseling counseling_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_be be_receiving receiving_ideally ideally_would would_help help_a a_little little_bit bit_with with_the the_anxiety anxiety_.
 have_you you_ever ever_been been_on on_any any_medication medication_for for_anxiety anxiety_.
 mm_.
 so_the the_antidepressant antidepressant_right right_now now_is is_actually actually_making making_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_worth worth_it it_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 and_it it_feels feels_like like_you you_.
 and_i i_think think_you you_had had_said said_too too_that that_in in_addition addition_to to_the the_counseling counseling_you you_would would_also also_potentially potentially_consider consider_talking talking_to to_someone someone_about about_anxiety anxiety_as as_well well_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 but_that that_isn isn_&apos;t &apos;t_something something_that that_you you_had had_had had_sort sort_of of_.
 okay_so so_it it_was was_in in_relation relation_to to_the the_overdose overdose_okay okay_.
 and_so so_i i_guess guess_when when_people people_think think_about about_their their_drug drug_use use_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_all all_sorts sorts_of of_different different_ways ways_in in_which which_people people_can can_approach approach_it it_so so_in in_terms terms_of of_whether whether_or or_not not_they they_wanna wanna_change change_.
 for_a a_lot lot_of of_people people_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_you you_know know_actually actually_yeah yeah_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_see see_any any_problems problems_with with_what what_is is_going going_on on_or or_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_pretty pretty_happy happy_with with_how how_things things_are are_and and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_just just_gonna gonna_kind kind_of of_stick stick_to to_how how_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_and and_not not_really really_change change_my my_use use_.
 for_some some_people people_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_cutting cutting_down down_a a_little little_bit bit_whatever whatever_cutting cutting_down down_might might_mean mean_for for_them them_personally personally_.
 for_some some_people people_it it_might might_be be_okay okay_well well_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_just just_gonna gonna_make make_sure sure_that that_i i_use use_in in_a a_safe safe_way way_.
 so_maybe maybe_not not_drink drink_and and_drive drive_or or_maybe maybe_not not_smoke smoke_and and_drive drive_.
 and_then then_for for_some some_people people_it it_might might_be be_trying trying_to to_quit quit_completely completely_but but_knowing knowing_there there_might might_be be_a a_slip slip_here here_and and_there there_.
 and_then then_finally finally_for for_another another_set set_of of_people people_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_completely completely_stopping stopping_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_it it_completely completely_done done_.
 so_where where_would would_you you_say say_that that_you you_would would_fall fall_on on_that that_right right_now now_.
 okay_so so_by by_cutting cutting_down down_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_were were_thinking thinking_use use_occasionally occasionally_but but_not not_use use_as as_much much_.
 okay_.
 okay_and and_it it_seems seems_like like_what what_you you_had had_said said_too too_is is_maybe maybe_if if_there there_were were_other other_ways ways_that that_you you_could could_help help_deal deal_with with_your your_anxiety anxiety_then then_smoking smoking_weed weed_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_necessarily necessarily_be be_something something_that that_would would_be be_as as_necessary necessary_all all_the the_time time_.
 and_so so_if if_you you_had had_to to_rate rate_it it_on on_a a_one one_to to_ten ten_scale scale_with with_one one_being being_not not_at at_all all_and and_ten ten_being being_extremely extremely_how how_confident confident_would would_you you_be be_at at_this this_point point_to to_be be_able able_to to_start start_working working_towards towards_that that_goal goal_.
 okay_so so_higher higher_than than_a a_two two_or or_three three_.
 okay_so so_what what_do do_you you_think think_it it_would would_take take_for for_you you_to to_get get_like like_a a_six six_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_is is_it it_more more_just just_sort sort_of of_kind kind_of of_making making_up up_your your_mind mind_to to_do do_it it_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 okay_but but_once once_you you_made made_up up_your your_mind mind_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_pretty pretty_confident confident_that that_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_able able_to to_see see_it it_through through_.
 okay_.
 well_would would_it it_be be_okay okay_with with_you you_if if_i i_give give_you you_a a_call call_in in_about about_a a_week week_&apos;s &apos;s_time time_just just_to to_check check_in in_and and_say say_hello hello_see see_if if_you you_have have_any any_questions questions_for for_me me_see see_if if_anything anything_kinda kinda_came came_up up_with with_this this_.
 and_so so_let let_me me_see see_if if_i i_can can_get get_your your_number number_.
 mm-hmm_.
 zero_two two_five five_seven seven_.
 okay_and and_so so_again again_from from_our our_talk talk_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_had had_obviously obviously_a a_lot lot_going going_on on_in in_the the_past past_few few_months months_that that_have have_been been_really really_intense intense_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_kinda kinda_caused caused_a a_higher higher_level level_of of_anxiety anxiety_which which_has has_sort sort_of of_been been_part part_of of_the the_reason reason_why why_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_medicating medicating_a a_little little_bit bit_with with_marijuana marijuana_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 yeah_it it_sounds sounds_like like_kind kind_of of_almost almost_losing losing_parent parent_right right_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_very very_difficult difficult_on on_top top_of of_everything everything_else else_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_going going_on on_as as_well well_.
 but_it it_also also_sounds sounds_like like_you you_are are_kind kind_of of_in in_counseling counseling_for for_what what_happened happened_with with_your your_daughter daughter_and and_then then_also also_eventually eventually_have have_an an_appointment appointment_for for_mental mental_health health_counseling counseling_to to_sort sort_of of_address address_maybe maybe_depression depression_and and_anxiety anxiety_.
 and_the the_goal goal_that that_you you_sort sort_of of_see see_yourself yourself_having having_is is_ideally ideally_maybe maybe_not not_having having_as as_much much_anxiety anxiety_so so_then then_you you_could could_cut cut_down down_your your_use use_a a_little little_bit bit_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_little little_more more_occasional occasional_maybe maybe_once once_or or_twice twice_a a_week week_.
 okay_well well_yeah yeah_if if_i i_can can_give give_you you_a a_call call_next next_week week_just just_to to_check check_in in_and and_see see_if if_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_thinking thinking_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_that that_goal goal_and and_and and_how how_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_doing doing_in in_general general_so so_.
 in_the the_meantime meantime_.
 i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_go go_ahead ahead_and and_stop stop_this this_.
 there_we we_go go_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_on on_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_recording recording_now now_uh-huh uh-huh_.

 well_so so_just just_kind kind_of of_winding winding_things things_up up_here here_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_some some_plans plans_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_plans plans_to to_kind kind_of of_take take_seriously seriously_your your_meetings meetings_and and_work work_on on_your your_goal goal_of of_getting getting_into into_your your_business business_you you_cutting cutting_back back_on on_your your_substance substance_use use_.
 and_those those_are are_all all_really really_really really_good good_things things_.
 i_hope hope_your your_business business_goes goes_for for_you you_.
 but_i i_will will_also also_tell tell_you you_that that_a a_lot lot_of of_things things_say say_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_never never_a a_failure failure_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_it it_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_learning learning_experience experience_.
 which_is is_exactly exactly_what what_you you_kinda kinda_told told_me me_you you_learning learning_at at_going going_to to_those those_meetings meetings_.
 you_should should_look look_at at_in in_business business_like like_that that_as as_sort sort_of of_a a_chance chance_to to_relearn relearn_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 but_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_never never_a a_failure failure_as as_long long_as as_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_tried tried_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_never never_a a_failure failure_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_learning learning_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_next next_step step_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_next next_step step_.

 so_chloe chloe_explained explained_to to_you you_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_happen happen_next next_.
 okay_so so_what what_we we_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_to to_do do_is is_sort sort_of of_is is_continue continue_the the_conversation conversation_with with_you you_about about_some some_of of_the the_things things_that that_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_answered answered_on on_the the_many many_different different_questionnaires questionnaires_that that_you you_did did_with with_her her_.
 if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_okay okay_with with_you you_i i_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_to to_ask ask_you you_to to_just just_maybe maybe_talk talk_with with_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_your your_current current_drug drug_use use_and and_how how_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_for for_you you_.
 or_how how_it it_works works_or or_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_work work_.
 yeah_so so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_it it_.
 if_you you_just just_wanna wanna_kinda kinda_let let_me me_know know_.
 all_right right_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_drug drug_of of_choice choice_.
 so_it it_was was_eight eight_years years_ago ago_.
 and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_still still_in in_a a_lot lot_of of_pain pain_.
 and_you you_have have_been been_for for_eight eight_years years_all all_right right_.
 and_your your_doctor doctor_&apos;s &apos;s_prescribing prescribing_you you_painkillers painkillers_.
 okay_.
 yeah_tell tell_me me_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_get get_a a_hold hold_of of_them them_.
 okay_.
 all_right right_are are_there there_other other_drugs drugs_that that_you you_use use_.
 so_really really_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_only only_alcohol alcohol_and and_painkillers painkillers_.
 uh-huh_.
 oh_.
 okay_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_clear clear_about about_your your_limits limits_on on_alcohol alcohol_use use_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_drink drink_alcohol alcohol_on on_occasion occasion_to to_socialize socialize_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_that that_big big_of of_a a_deal deal_.
 talk_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_about about_the the_painkillers painkillers_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_feel feel_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_getting getting_adequate adequate_pain pain_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 oh_what what_helps helps_about about_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_so so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_tried tried_other other_things things_and and_you you_currently currently_are are_working working_on on_doing doing_it it_sounds sounds_like like_a a_variety variety_of of_things things_to to_try try_to to_help help_ease ease_some some_of of_this this_pain pain_chronic chronic_pain pain_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_effective effective_sometimes sometimes_not not_all all_the the_time time_.
 the_stuff stuff_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_working working_with with_through through_the the_pain pain_clinic clinic_.
 okay_.
 okay_and and_as as_far far_as as_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_concerned concerned_or or_what what_you you_would would_like like_is is_to to_have have_more more_relief relief_of of_your your_pain pain_and and_you you_would would_like like_to to_get get_narcotics narcotics_to to_help help_with with_that that_.
 okay_.
 and_narcotics narcotics_have have_been been_the the_only only_thing thing_that that_other other_than than_this this_brief brief_periods periods_of of_relief relief_the the_narcotics narcotics_have have_only only_been been_the the_things things_to to_work work_.
 okay_.
 right_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_wanting wanting_narcotics narcotics_in in_particular particular_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_worked worked_.
 okay_can can_you you_describe describe_that that_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_about about_how how_it it_works works_.
 or_how how_is is_it it_more more_effective effective_than than_anything anything_else else_.
 okay_.
 wow_.
 that_sounds sounds_like like_a a_lot lot_of of_pain pain_.
 uh-huh_.
 tell_me me_about about_how how_the the_narcotics narcotics_work work_in in_what what_ways ways_do do_they they_work work_.
 yeah_.
 sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_had had_many many_years years_of of_being being_in in_pain pain_without without_much much_relief relief_.
 about_ten ten_years years_or or_so so_.
 hmm_.
 yeah_pretty pretty_serious serious_accident accident_.
 wow_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_fortunate fortunate_to to_have have_survived survived_.
 oh_yeah yeah_so so_the the_misfortune misfortune_was was_that that_now now_you you_have have_to to_live live_with with_this this_chronic chronic_pain pain_.
 so_you you_said said_that that_using using_narcotics narcotics_helps helps_you you_sleep sleep_better better_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_use use_it it_for for_breakthrough breakthrough_pain pain_.
 what_else else_what what_else else_is is_what what_else else_makes makes_it it_better better_.
 yeah_.
 but_what what_else else_how how_else else_is is_are are_the the_narcotics narcotics_better better_than than_anything anything_else else_.
 okay_.
 and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_get get_them them_i i_think think_as as_you you_said said_legally legally_or or_illegally illegally_just just_because because_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_effective effective_.
 so_tell tell_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_what what_are are_some some_perhaps perhaps_negative negative_or or_some some_risks risks_associated associated_with with_narcotics narcotics_.
 we_already already_talked talked_about about_one one_being being_illegal illegal_it it_could could_potentially potentially_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_illegal illegal_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_to to_give give_somebody somebody_else else_your your_prescription prescription_.
 yeah_.
 wow_.
 are_you you_concerned concerned_at at_all all_about about_any any_aspects aspects_of of_taking taking_painkillers painkillers_.
 does_that that_concern concern_you you_at at_all all_.
 okay_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_take take_them them_that that_much much_.
 but_is is_that that_because because_you you_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_all all_you you_can can_get get_.
 all_right right_so so_you you_would would_take take_them them_more more_if if_you you_had had_them them_.
 yeah_.
 so_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_hypothetically hypothetically_say say_if if_you you_had had_them them_if if_you you_had had_unlimited unlimited_access access_can can_you you_think think_of of_anything anything_that that_you you_would would_be be_then then_concerned concerned_about about_in in_terms terms_of of_taking taking_those those_.
 so_you you_would would_what what_are are_some some_risks risks_that that_you you_know know_of of_that that_would would_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_of of_that that_would would_motivate motivate_you you_to to_take take_them them_as as_prescribed prescribed_.
 so_though though_you you_are are_aware aware_of of_the the_potential potential_for for_addiction addiction_as as_a a_concern concern_.
 okay_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_comfortable comfortable_with with_knowing knowing_that that_you you_would would_be be_able able_to to_manage manage_taking taking_painkillers painkillers_as as_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_prescribed prescribed_then then_addiction addiction_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_be be_an an_issue issue_for for_you you_okay okay_all all_right right_.
 do_you you_have have_any any_other other_things things_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kinda kinda_concerned concerned_about about_in in_terms terms_of of_drug drug_use use_.
 oh_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_your your_main main_concern concern_is is_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_getting getting_adequate adequate_narcotics narcotics_to to_help help_ease ease_your your_pain pain_.
 yeah_tell tell_me me_how how_that that_discussion discussion_has has_gone gone_with with_your your_doctor doctor_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_your your_pain pain_doctor doctor_is is_actually actually_recommending recommending_that that_you you_get get_more more_pain pain_medication medication_.
 yeah_okay okay_but but_your your_primary primary_care care_doctor doctor_&apos;s &apos;s_has has_refused refused_to to_prescribe prescribe_that that_for for_anybody anybody_.
 all_right right_.
 yeah_.
 what_do do_you you_.
 where_do do_you you_think think_everyone everyone_&apos;s &apos;s_reluctance reluctance_to to_prescribe prescribe_this this_kind kind_of of_medication medication_comes comes_from from_.
 yeah_what what_do do_you you_think think_she she_&apos;s &apos;s_concerned concerned_about about_.
 using_it it_responsibly responsibly_.
 yeah_all all_right right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_just just_to to_review review_a a_little little_bit bit_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_different different_types types_of of_treatments treatments_to to_reduce reduce_your your_pain pain_some some_of of_which which_are are_effective effective_some some_are are_not not_but but_really really_the the_most most_effective effective_has has_been been_the the_painkillers painkillers_helps helps_.
 so_the the_chiropractor chiropractor_has has_been been_even even_more more_effective effective_than than_the the_painkillers painkillers_.
 so_why why_is is_that that_not not_available available_to to_you you_.
 okay_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_covered covered_through through_your your_insurance insurance_.
 i_wonder wonder_if if_your your_doctor doctor_was was_able able_to to_prescribe prescribe_it it_or or_something something_.
 certainly_i i_bet bet_that that_if if_she she_knew knew_that that_that that_was was_even even_more more_effective effective_than than_pain pain_medication medication_that that_would would_be be_more more_interesting interesting_to to_her her_probably probably_yeah yeah_.
 right_.
 yup_so so_just just_in in_terms terms_of of_talking talking_about about_the the_pain pain_medication medication_then then_it it_does does_help help_you you_sleep sleep_better better_helps helps_with with_breakthrough breakthrough_pain pain_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_more more_effective effective_than than_anything anything_that that_you you_have have_available available_to to_you you_right right_now now_at at_the the_other other_hand hand_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_illegal illegal_and and_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_taking taking_a a_legal legal_risk risk_by by_taking taking_other other_people people_&apos;s &apos;s_medication medication_.
 and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_aware aware_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_potential potential_for for_addiction addiction_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_really really_not not_worried worried_about about_that that_.
 okay_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_your your_doctor doctor_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_reluctant reluctant_to to_prescribe prescribe_them them_so so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_a a_problem problem_.
 okay_so so_what what_do do_you you_think think_what what_do do_you you_think think_you you_might might_do do_considering considering_all all_of of_those those_things things_.
 kinda_keep keep_going going_doing doing_.
 all_right right_part part_of of_this this_conversation conversation_we we_had had_is is_to to_show show_you you_a a_score score_that that_you you_got got_on on_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_called called_a a_drug drug_abuse abuse_screening screening_test test_.
 and_that that_was was_part part_of of_the the_questionnaires questionnaires_that that_you you_did did_.
 and_what what_i i_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_to to_do do_is is_ask ask_you you_this this_drug drug_abuse abuse_screening screening_test test_is is_scaled scaled_from from_zero zero_to to_ten ten_with with_zero zero_being being_no no_risk risk_and and_ten ten_being being_severe severe_risk risk_.
 and_in in_the the_middle middle_there there_is is_some some_risk risk_and and_moderate moderate_risk risk_.
 and_i i_just just_wondered wondered_what what_you you_thought thought_how how_much much_does does_your your_drug drug_use use_your your_current current_drug drug_use use_how how_much much_risk risk_does does_it it_expose expose_you you_to to_.
 and_by by_risk risk_.
 not_much much_.
 would_you you_say say_no no_risk risk_some some_risk risk_moderate moderate_risk risk_or or_severe severe_risk risk_.
 okay_well well_it it_turns turns_out out_that that_the the_way way_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_scored scored_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_some some_risk risk_as as_well well_.
 which_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_mean mean_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_no no_risk risk_it it_means means_there there_is is_some some_risk risk_.
 and_we we_talked talked_about about_what what_those those_risks risks_might might_be be_.
 i_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_this this_this this_is is_what what_chloe chloe_gave gave_to to_me me_.
 yeah_and and_we we_talked talked_about about_those those_risks risks_being being_legal legal_and and_some some_of of_those those_risks risks_being being_addiction addiction_.
 okay_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_some some_things things_to to_reduce reduce_that that_risk risk_.
 okay_.
 all_right right_well well_do do_you you_have have_any any_questions questions_about about_anything anything_that that_we we_talked talked_about about_.
 i_appreciate appreciate_you you_taking taking_the the_time time_to to_do do_this this_.
 i_know know_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_have have_your your_this this_is is_clearly clearly_something something_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_for for_you you_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_dealing dealing_with with_it it_for for_a a_long long_time time_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_explored explored_some some_different different_options options_that that_have have_been been_effective effective_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_continue continue_to to_do do_that that_but but_also also_continue continue_to to_do do_what what_you you_need need_to to_do do_then then_to to_relieve relieve_your your_pain pain_.
 yeah_all all_right right_so so_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_have have_anything anything_else else_to to_.
 i_appreciate appreciate_you you_talking talking_to to_me me_.
 and_this this_is is_for for_you you_.
 and_i i_need need_to to_actually actually_we we_have have_one one_more more_part part_that that_we we_need need_to to_do do_together together_and and_i i_would would_like like_to to_call call_you you_in in_about about_a a_week week_just just_to to_kind kind_of of_review review_some some_of of_the the_things things_we we_talked talked_about about_if if_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_all all_right right_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_phone phone_number number_where where_i i_can can_call call_you you_on on_.

 so_thanks thanks_for for_coming coming_back back_.
 i_know know_that that_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_a a_hassle hassle_sometimes sometimes_.
 and_for for_answering answering_all all_those those_questions questions_you you_did did_yesterday yesterday_.
 we_appreciate appreciate_you you_participating participating_in in_the the_study study_.
 one_of of_the the_forms forms_or or_one one_of of_the the_questionnaires questionnaires_that that_you you_have have_completed completed_was was_what what_they they_call call_a a_drug drug_assessment assessment_screening screening_test test_that that_kind kind_of of_assesses assesses_your your_risk risk_of of_your your_use use_.
 and_i i_was was_wondering wondering_if if_you you_were were_interested interested_in in_kind kind_of of_the the_outcome outcome_of of_that that_.
 the_results results_of of_that that_screening screening_test test_.
 uh-huh_it it_rates rates_you you_on on_your your_risk risk_from from_zero zero_to to_ten ten_with with_zero zero_being being_no no_risk risk_and and_ten ten_being being_really really_high high_risk risk_.
 where_do do_you you_think think_you you_might might_have have_placed placed_.
 you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_.
 you_rated rated_a a_four four_.
 well_according according_to to_their their_assessment assessment_that that_would would_be be_moderate moderate_risk risk_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_at at_the the_top top_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_down down_at at_the the_bottom bottom_either either_so so_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_some some_moderate moderate_risk risk_from from_your your_use use_.
 what_do do_you you_make make_of of_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 well_forget forget_the the_test test_.
 tell_me me_what what_you you_think think_about about_your your_drug drug_use use_.
 mm-hmm_.

 mm-hmm_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_difference difference_for for_you you_.
 what_makes makes_you you_decide decide_to to_stop stop_using using_for for_a a_while while_.
 mm_.

 okay_.
 so_sometimes sometimes_you you_just just_get get_kinda kinda_tired tired_of of_it it_all all_the the_hustles hustles_you you_say say_the the_hassle hassle_maybe maybe_of of_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 oh_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_times times_that that_you you_realize realize_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_doing doing_it it_and and_you you_how how_you you_feel feel_about about_yourself yourself_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_it it_wow wow_.
 mm-hmm_so so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_really really_been been_able able_to to_kinda kinda_look look_inside inside_it it_and and_say say_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_who who_i i_am am_and and_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_doing doing_and and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_gonna gonna_stop stop_this this_and and_stop stop_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_.

 how_do do_you you_do do_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_.
 mm-hmm_.

 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 kinda_with with_all all_kinds kinds_of of_stuff stuff_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 sure_well well_wendell wendell_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_had had_the the_experience experience_of of_friends friends_and and_other other_people people_that that_you you_know know_.
 and_some some_of of_the the_people people_that that_i i_&apos;ve &apos;ve_worked worked_with with_know know_that that_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_hard hard_to to_just just_stop stop_without without_a a_process process_or or_a a_difficulty difficulty_or or_slips slips_and and_going going_back back_and and_forth forth_and and_back back_and and_forth forth_.
 and_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_telling telling_me me_is is_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_just just_stop stop_cold cold_turkey turkey_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_what what_are are_you you_using using_now now_primarily primarily_.
 cocaine_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_how how_much much_are are_you you_using using_cocaine cocaine_.
 do_you you_.
 mm_and and_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_said said_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_to to_the the_end end_of of_another another_run run_.
 mm_.
 so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_just just_fascinated fascinated_.
 and_was was_wondering wondering_if if_you you_can can_tell tell_me me_how how_do do_you you_.
 i_mean mean_because because_as as_you you_said said_cocaine cocaine_is is_a a_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_.
 mind-altering_chemical chemical_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_hard hard_drug drug_.
 people_get get_hooked hooked_because because_it it_feels feels_good good_and and_they they_want want_that that_feeling feeling_again again_and and_again again_and and_again again_.
 and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_i i_want want_that that_but but_boom boom_i i_can can_shut shut_the the_door door_.
 hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_tell tell_me me_what what_it it_is is_that that_stops stops_being being_fun fun_about about_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 least_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_how how_you you_see see_it it_right right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_stop stop_without without_dwelling dwelling_on on_the the_good good_things things_that that_you you_liked liked_about about_it it_.
 which_can can_lead lead_people people_to to_slip slip_back back_and and_try try_it it_again again_.
 ahh_.
 mm-hmm_.
 hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.

 yeah_so so_even even_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_recognizing recognizing_that that_those those_thoughts thoughts_are are_not not_kinda kinda_crazy crazy_.
 mm-hmm_.
 wow_.
 so_you you_said said_earlier earlier_that that_you you_went went_from from_ninety ninety_two two_to to_ninety ninety_eight eight_or or_ninety ninety_six six_whatever whatever_it it_was was_clean clean_and and_then then_woke woke_up up_one one_day day_and and_kinda kinda_thought thought_back back_when when_you you_got got_high high_.
 oh_.
 what_do do_you you_think think_was was_the the_.
 mm-hmm_.
 hmm_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_knew knew_that that_was was_coming coming_up up_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_what what_do do_.
 you_get get_from from_it it_.
 using_.

 different_how how_.
 do_you you_like like_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 but_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_.
 right_.
 sure_.
 but_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_looking looking_for for_it it_sounds sounds_like like_because because_you you_said said_i i_get get_to to_act act_out out_in in_a a_way way_that that_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_normally normally_.
 what_do do_you you_want want_to to_do do_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 so_i i_wanna wanna_make make_sure sure_i i_understand understand_because because_i i_understand understand_all all_that that_but but_i i_feel feel_like like_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_missing missing_a a_piece piece_in in_getting getting_you you_.
 so_i i_understand understand_that that_the the_drug drug_changes changes_your your_brain brain_and and_how how_you you_see see_things things_and and_you you_get get_paranoid paranoid_and and_see see_things things_that that_aren aren_&apos;t &apos;t_there there_sometimes sometimes_and and_that that_stuff stuff_i i_get get_.
 but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_almost almost_like like_i i_wanna wanna_be be_able able_to to_act act_differently differently_than than_i i_do do_in in_my my_normal normal_life life_.
 and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_wondering wondering_what what_is is_it it_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_what what_do do_you you_to to_act act_different different_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_piece piece_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_trying trying_to to_understand understand_.
 what_do do_you you_want want_to to_be be_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_what what_do do_you you_.
 yeah_i i_know know_.
 you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_need need_to to_be be_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_talking talking_about about_you you_and and_your your_experience experience_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 go_.

 what_i i_hear hear_is is_this this_real real_mix mix_for for_you you_kinda kinda_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pulled pulled_in in_two two_different different_directions directions_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_this this_part part_of of_you you_that that_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_the the_hassle hassle_and and_the the_hustle hustle_and and_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_the the_paranoia paranoia_and and_the the_weird weird_feelings feelings_and and_things things_that that_go go_on on_.
 well_but but_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_part part_of of_you you_that that_feels feels_like like_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_need need_to to_kinda kinda_get get_out out_of of_your your_normal normal_quote-unquote quote-unquote_mode mode_you you_wanna wanna_feel feel_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_if if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_freer freer_or or_more more_excited excited_or or_something something_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_wanting wanting_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_different different_than than_your your_normal normal_life life_and and_yet yet_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_it it_when when_you you_get get_there there_and and_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kind kind_of of_between between_a a_rock rock_and and_a a_hard hard_place place_sometimes sometimes_.
 there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_part part_of of_you you_that that_wants wants_the the_normal normal_life life_and and_the the_other other_part part_of of_you you_is is_wanting wanting_to to_be be_able able_to to_be be_different different_and and_how how_you you_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_quite quite_sure sure_what what_the the_different different_is is_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_wanting wanting_but but_how how_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_gotten gotten_that that_is is_through through_the the_cocaine cocaine_.
 and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_just just_wondering wondering_have have_you you_ever ever_thought thought_about about_being being_able able_to to_be be_whatever whatever_that that_different different_is is_freer freer_more more_without without_the the_cocaine cocaine_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.

 yeah_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_other other_than than_this this_different different_feeling feeling_that that_we we_had had_a a_little little_trouble trouble_pinning pinning_down down_what what_else else_do do_you you_get get_out out_of of_getting getting_high high_.
 what_else else_are are_the the_benefits benefits_what what_are are_the the_good good_things things_for for_you you_of of_getting getting_high high_.
 mm_.
 hmm_.
 why_do do_you you_need need_to to_get get_away away_from from_.
 you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 so_you you_have have_a a_real real_sense sense_of of_responsibility responsibility_and and_self self_care care_.
 do_you you_ever ever_feel feel_like like_you you_can can_get get_away away_from from_people people_without without_getting getting_high high_.
 mm-hmm_.

 uh-huh_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_lot lot_of of_experience experience_.
 so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_kinda kinda_fascinated fascinated_.
 you_said said_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_never never_really really_thought thought_about about_kinda kinda_what what_are are_the the_good good_things things_and and_the the_bad bad_things things_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 so_wendell wendell_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_is is_i i_work work_hard hard_to to_get get_my my_money money_and and_then then_to to_turn turn_around around_and and_just just_blow blow_it it_on on_blow blow_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_make make_sense sense_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_the the_paranoia paranoia_that that_comes comes_with with_it it_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_that that_kinda kinda_sense sense_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_wanna wanna_be be_around around_people people_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_see see_any any_in in_your your_own own_words words_you you_said said_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_see see_any any_benefits benefits_of of_using using_.
 yeah_.
 hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.

 oh_mellowing mellowing_out out_a a_little little_today today_.
 mellowing_out out_a a_little little_today today_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.

 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 okay_.
 so_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_care care_about about_labels labels_.
 you_described described_yourself yourself_as as_a a_functioning functioning_addict addict_.
 what_do do_you you_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_plan plan_.
 you_talked talked_about about_you you_think think_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kind kind_of of_heading heading_toward toward_a a_clean clean_and and_sober sober_phase phase_.
 do_you you_have have_a a_plan plan_about about_when when_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_happen happen_or or_how how_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_happen happen_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 can_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_that that_.
 okay_so so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_real real_.
 mm-hmm_.
 but_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_also also_a a_real real_vision vision_and and_goal goal_that that_you you_have have_to to_work work_for for_if if_i i_want want_to to_be be_there there_for for_those those_people people_and and_help help_them them_out out_and and_do do_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_.
 so_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_that that_they they_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_that that_like like_for for_you you_admit admit_to to_them them_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.

 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 ahh_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.

 right_.
 hmm_.
 right_.
 sure_.

 mm-hmm_.
 tired_of of_it it_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.

 okay_but but_just just_kinda kinda_touch touch_base base_to to_see see_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_after after_our our_conversation conversation_today today_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_one one_of of_the the_things things_maybe maybe_is is_to to_follow follow_up up_on on_the the_thought thought_about about_are are_there there_any any_good good_things things_about about_getting getting_high high_.
 right_.
 okay_and and_maybe maybe_also also_the the_plan plan_if if_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_kinda kinda_firmed firmed_up up_maybe maybe_your your_plan plan_about about_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_quit quit_.

 yeah_i i_think think_i i_&apos;d &apos;d_just just_take take_it it_to to_the the_store store_and and_they they_&apos;ll &apos;ll_do do_whatever whatever_they they_need need_.
 but_i i_think think_they they_&apos;ll &apos;ll_scan scan_that that_and and_it it_should should_deduct deduct_this this_as as_you you_need need_to to_but but_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_twenty twenty_five five_.

 did_they they_.
 i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_any any_.
 i_can can_call call_up up_and and_see see_if if_they they_have have_any any_.
 oh_okay okay_well well_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_go go_back back_.
 okay_yeah yeah_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_recording recording_now now_.
 so_how how_has has_this this_been been_for for_you you_so so_far far_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kinda kinda_looking looking_at at_yourself yourself_trying trying_to to_get get_some some_help help_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_say say_you you_feel feel_like like_maybe maybe_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_addicted addicted_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_circumstances circumstances_and and_stuff stuff_like like_.
 okay_.
 do_the the_same same_things things_over over_and and_over over_.
 yeah_.
 if_you you_could could_change change_those those_patterns patterns_something something_like like_that that_okay okay_.
 okay_.
 well_like like_megan megan_said said_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_alex alex_and and_this this_part part_of of_the the_interview interview_is is_a a_little little_bit bit_different different_.
 because_i i_know know_she she_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_asking asking_a a_lot lot_of of_questions questions_like like_you you_said said_.
 and_here here_we we_just just_kinda kinda_wanna wanna_give give_you you_a a_chance chance_to to_talk talk_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_about about_drug drug_use use_and and_i i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_kinda kinda_just just_be be_following following_along along_with with_you you_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_thinking thinking_about about_change change_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_definitely definitely_not not_and and_that that_topic topic_might might_come come_up up_but but_this this_isn isn_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_a a_situation situation_where where_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_trying trying_to to_force force_you you_change change_one one_way way_or or_another another_or or_anything anything_like like_.
 that_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_really really_just just_trying trying_to to_hear hear_your your_ideas ideas_about about_kinda kinda_what what_you you_want want_to to_happen happen_with with_your your_drug drug_use use_and and_stuff stuff_like like_that that_.
 because_some some_people people_come come_in in_they they_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_wanna wanna_change change_anything anything_some some_people people_come come_in in_they they_wanna wanna_do do_complete complete_one one_eighty eighty_.
 so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_up up_to to_you you_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_the the_driver driver_&apos;s &apos;s_seat seat_.
 okay_and and_it it_usually usually_takes takes_about about_fifteen fifteen_to to_twenty twenty_five five_minutes minutes_and and_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_see see_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_anything anything_else else_that that_we we_should should_mention mention_.
 they_also also_give give_us us_this this_sheet sheet_here here_to to_share share_with with_you you_and and_this this_is is_based based_on on_some some_of of_the the_answers answers_that that_you you_gave gave_us us_.
 and_this this_is is_risk risk_factors factors_based based_on on_drug drug_use use_and and_you you_scored scored_an an_eight eight_which which_is is_up up_here here_in in_the the_severe severe_risk risk_.
 mm-hmm_can can_you you_tell tell_me me_about about_that that_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_severe severe_about about_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_yeah yeah_.
 so_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_it it_seems seems_like like_now now_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_older older_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_connection connection_between between_drug drug_use use_and and_your your_health health_.
 and_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_talking talking_mostly mostly_cocaine cocaine_right right_.
 okay_so so_you you_see see_a a_connection connection_between between_the the_two two_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 maybe_the the_scene scene_where where_you you_go go_.

 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_about about_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_about about_where where_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_definitely definitely_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_better better_place place_than than_where where_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_yeah yeah_.
 can_you you_tell tell_me me_more more_about about_kinda kinda_that that_pattern pattern_or or_how how_it it_fits fits_into into_your your_everyday everyday_life life_like like_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 so_based based_on on_some some_of of_your your_doing doing_some some_of of_the the_old old_behaviors behaviors_now now_you you_kinda kinda_see see_that that_maybe maybe_spiraling spiraling_out out_of of_control control_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 this_ain ain_&apos;t &apos;t_your your_first first_rodeo rodeo_.
 ahh_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_could could_be be_severe severe_consequences consequences_based based_just just_on on_using using_cocaine cocaine_okay okay_.
 so_you you_mentioned mentioned_that that_there there_were were_patterns patterns_of of_behavior behavior_things things_that that_you you_do do_over over_and and_over over_again again_.
 mm-hmm_.
 hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 kind_of of_caught caught_yourself yourself_doing doing_that that_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_said said_kinda kinda_like like_ahh ahh_yeah yeah_i i_could could_see see_myself myself_doing doing_that that_.
 uh-huh_.
 i_see see_so so_you you_find find_yourself yourself_throughout throughout_the the_day day_.
 is_this this_every every_day day_or or_most most_days days_.
 not_every every_day day_.
 a_couple couple_days days_a a_week week_or or_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 definitely_yeah yeah_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_maybe maybe_a a_sense sense_of of_pride pride_about about_getting getting_this this_stuff stuff_together together_and and_trying trying_to to_seek seek_help help_for for_you you_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_have have_a a_strong strong_awareness awareness_of of_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_where where_you you_need need_to to_be be_and and_what what_you you_need need_to to_do do_to to_do do_that that_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_already already_getting getting_some some_of of_that that_in in_place place_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_still still_finding finding_yourself yourself_doing doing_some some_of of_these these_behaviors behaviors_.
 some_old old_thoughts thoughts_even even_.
 okay_so so_some some_of of_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_old old_behaviors behaviors_like like_hanging hanging_around around_people people_who who_are are_using using_when when_you you_know know_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_but but_then then_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_also also_some some_thoughts thoughts_that that_keep keep_this this_going going_as as_well well_.
 mm-hmm_yeah yeah_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_curious curious_about about_what what_maybe maybe_some some_of of_those those_thoughts thoughts_are are_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_okay okay_with with_sharing sharing_them them_.
 sound_like like_you you_said said_some some_of of_those those_old old_thoughts thoughts_keep keep_you you_.
 going_.
 mm_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_working working_for for_you you_.
 no_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_costing costing_you you_more more_money money_than than_you you_.
 should_be be_.
 okay_.
 hmm_.
 right_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_hard hard_to to_get get_by by_.

 uh-huh_yeah yeah_.
 yeah_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_almost almost_like like_you you_notice notice_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_coming coming_up up_short short_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_red red_flag flag_there there_.
 they_&apos;re &apos;re_popping popping_up up_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_and and_you you_also also_said said_that that_it it_seemed seemed_like like_there there_was was_some some_relationship relationship_between between_using using_and and_your your_health health_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 well_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_been been_a a_real real_stressful stressful_trip trip_for for_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_about about_if if_cocaine cocaine_was was_out out_of of_the the_picture picture_or or_scaled scaled_back back_that that_this this_would would_be be_a a_little little_bit bit_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_so so_some some_of of_that that_might might_be be_just just_making making_a a_connection connection_with with_all all_those those_people people_also also_who who_use use_drugs drugs_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_become become_a a_strong strong_association association_between between_seeking seeking_out out_people people_but but_people people_who who_use use_drugs drugs_yeah yeah_.
 so_what what_do do_you you_there there_must must_be be_something something_about about_it it_that that_does does_do do_something something_for for_you you_.
 mm-hmm_sure sure_well well_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_could could_use use_the the_comfort comfort_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_could could_use use_some some_comfort comfort_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_say say_that that_comfort comfort_but but_some some_comfort comfort_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 i_wonder wonder_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_comfortable comfortable_about about_it it_what what_.
 so_so so_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_some some_sort sort_of of_sharing sharing_of of_experience experience_with with_these these_people people_then then_.
 is_it it_.
 oh_go go_ahead ahead_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_sorry sorry_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_even even_though though_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_group group_that that_uses uses_cocaine cocaine_and and_stuff stuff_like like_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_still still_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_a a_understanding understanding_or or_you you_guys guys_go go_through through_some some_of of_the the_same same_things things_or or_very very_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_.
 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_some some_shared shared_experiences experiences_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_accepting accepting_of of_the the_things things_that that_you you_need need_to to_do do_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_so so_yeah yeah_there there_is is_something something_positive positive_about about_this this_group group_of of_people people_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_out out_of of_hanging hanging_out out_with with_them them_but but_then then_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_also also_using using_drugs drugs_with with_them them_that that_sounds sounds_like like_yeah yeah_.
 mm_.
 yeah_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_a a_rough rough_ride ride_for for_you you_up up_and and_down down_huh huh_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_i i_mean mean_you you_told told_me me_there there_was was_a a_lot lot_of of_kind kind_of of_like like_negative negative_things things_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_seeing seeing_connection connection_between between_your your_use use_and and_your your_health health_the the_money money_and and_it it_was was_almost almost_just just_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_about about_using using_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_not not_where where_you you_wanna wanna_be be_at at_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 tasteless_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_then then_on on_the the_other other_side side_the the_positives positives_is is_you you_get get_to to_hang hang_around around_these these_people people_you you_kinda kinda_get get_a a_social social_support support_that that_way way_as as_well well_.
 mm-hmm_.

 that_you you_could could_make make_some some_money money_.
 or_they they_.

 you_can can_.
 through_selling selling_.
 mm_.
 as_soon soon_as as_you you_get get_some some_you you_spend spend_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.
 so_something something_about about_earning earning_money money_that that_way way_that that_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_sit sit_well well_with with_you you_as as_well well_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_lately lately_you you_find find_yourself yourself_more more_scraping scraping_by by_than than_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_to to_be be_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_so so_and and_then then_the the_positive positive_side side_was was_the the_relationships relationships_.
 was_there there_anything anything_else else_positive positive_about about_it it_that that_.
 no_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_hanging hanging_around around_with with_the the_friends friends_.
 and_then then_what what_happens happens_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_with with_these these_people people_how how_does does_it it_turn turn_into into_using using_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 and_what what_was was_that that_.
 what_was was_the the_.
 same_.
 mm_.
 go_to to_prison prison_or or_get get_sick sick_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_always always_some some_pretty pretty_bad bad_consequences consequences_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_periods periods_of of_time time_where where_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_clean clean_and and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_seen seen_the the_other other_side side_of of_the the_coin coin_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_so so_if if_you you_spend spend_the the_money money_on on_the the_dope dope_like like_you you_said said_that that_ends ends_up up_being being_kinda kinda_meaningless meaningless_whereas whereas_you you_could could_be be_treating treating_yourself yourself_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_wanting wanting_those those_.

 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 and_so so_the the_periods periods_in in_your your_life life_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_clean clean_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_noticed noticed_that that_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_what what_the the_experience experience_has has_been been_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_i i_even even_see see_you you_bubble bubble_up up_a a_little little_bit bit_when when_you you_talk talk_about about_it it_.
 yeah_so so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_better better_time time_for for_you you_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 yeah_and and_so so_you you_said said_you you_were were_taking taking_some some_next next_steps steps_to to_get get_there there_and and_you you_said said_that that_you you_were were_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 a_voluntary voluntary_outpatient outpatient_.
 you_look look_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_ready ready_for for_that that_it it_looks looks_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_anticipating anticipating_it it_.
 and_what what_are are_your your_goals goals_for for_that that_program program_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 yeah_so so_is is_there there_some some_things things_that that_you you_would would_like like_to to_be be_productive productive_with with_.
 mm-hmm_.

 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_and and_so so_is is_this this_outpatient outpatient_program program_is is_it it_a a_drug drug_treatment treatment_program program_.
 yeah_okay okay_okay okay_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_.

 it_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_top top_of of_the the_chart chart_.
 so_where where_would would_you you_like like_to to_be be_on on_that that_.
 at_no no_risk risk_so so_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_wanna wanna_be be_down down_there there_.
 so_your your_goals goals_for for_using using_and and_so so_i i_saw saw_on on_this this_sheet sheet_that that_you you_wrote wrote_that that_you you_wanna wanna_quit quit_using using_once once_and and_for for_all all_.
 and_so so_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_lot lot_of of_different different_things things_that that_you you_could could_do do_one one_is is_definitely definitely_to to_quit quit_once once_and and_for for_all all_.
 one_is is_to to_not not_do do_anything anything_.
 another_thing thing_you you_could could_do do_is is_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_already already_doing doing_is is_seeking seeking_some some_support support_through through_outpatient outpatient_.
 some_people people_choose choose_to to_just just_use use_in in_a a_controlled controlled_manner manner_.

 uh-huh_.

 that_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_there there_yeah yeah_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_not not_how how_it it_works works_for for_you you_.
 you_haven haven_&apos;t &apos;t_seen seen_it it_work work_that that_way way_so so_for for_you you_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_just just_to to_quit quit_.
 altogether_huh huh_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_so so_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_wanna wanna_do do_that that_quit quit_the the_b b_s s_which which_was was_the the_money money_problems problems_the the_health health_problems problems_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_wasting wasting_your your_time time_kinda kinda_like like_stuff stuff_like like_that that_kinda kinda_feeling feeling_bad bad_about about_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_quit quit_all all_that that_stuff stuff_come come_over over_to to_the the_other other_side side_and and_get get_through through_your your_program program_.
 treat_yourself yourself_.
 and_it it_sounded sounded_like like_there there_were were_things things_you you_wanted wanted_to to_be be_more more_productive productive_about about_whether whether_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_if if_you you_meant meant_being being_engaged engaged_in in_your your_treatment treatment_more more_or or_you you_mean mean_hanging hanging_out out_with with_different different_people people_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_there there_you you_go go_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_so so_using using_kinda kinda_keeps keeps_you you_from from_.
 doing_those those_things things_that that_you you_like like_to to_do do_.
 yeah_.
 ahh_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.
 yeah_done done_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_fighting fighting_that that_battle battle_for for_a a_while while_and and_it it_now now_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_serious serious_about about_changing changing_it it_in in_.
 mm-hmm_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 so_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_next next_step step_from from_today today_then then_to to_get get_this this_rolling rolling_.
 i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_that that_program program_is is_part part_of of_it it_.
 is_there there_anything anything_else else_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_after after_today today_to to_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 sure_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 so_would would_your your_goal goal_then then_to to_.
 i_know know_your your_goal goal_is is_to to_quit quit_using using_altogether altogether_.
 is_that that_to to_be be_totally totally_abstinent abstinent_after after_your your_program program_or or_are are_there there_steps steps_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_take take_now now_to to_get get_there there_.
 or_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_.
 you_said said_it it_just just_fine fine_then then_.
 so_i i_guess guess_yeah yeah_what what_i i_mean mean_is is_will will_that that_be be_after after_your your_program program_.
 will_it it_be be_before before_the the_program program_is is_finished finished_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_.
 beforehand_oh oh_okay okay_okay okay_.
 before_yeah yeah_yeah yeah_.
 yeah_and and_so so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_curious curious_about about_what what_are are_some some_of of_the the_other other_things things_that that_might might_be be_happening happening_along along_the the_way way_that that_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_help help_.
 there_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_.
 sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_some some_plans plans_about about_how how_to to_do do_that that_already already_.
 mm-hmm_so so_being being_aware aware_of of_those those_people people_places places_and and_things things_and and_.
 uh-huh_.
 yeah_.
 so_you you_must must_have have_some some_alternative alternative_ideas ideas_or or_some some_alternative alternative_activities activities_or or_something something_for for_when when_you you_start start_thinking thinking_about about_those those_things things_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_do do_these these_instead instead_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 sure_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;ll &apos;ll_be be_yeah yeah_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_already already_fighting fighting_some some_of of_that that_battle battle_and and_the the_rest rest_of of_it it_is is_gonna gonna_be be_a a_battle battle_but but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_one one_worth worth_fighting fighting_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_excellent excellent_okay okay_well well_great great_well well_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_really really_great great_talking talking_to to_you you_.
 and_i i_just just_wanna wanna_make make_sure sure_that that_i i_i i_mean mean_i i_think think_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_you you_loud loud_and and_clear clear_about about_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_kind kind_of of_in in_your your_way way_has has_been been_using using_with with_these these_friends friends_.

 and_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_your your_friends friends_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_falling falling_into into_those those_comforts comforts_but but_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_some some_other other_comforts comforts_on on_the the_other other_side side_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_calling calling_that that_comforts comforts_on on_this this_side side_but but_at at_the the_same same_time time_you you_end end_up up_kind kind_of of_scraping scraping_by by_more more_you you_end end_up up_getting getting_sick sick_more more_often often_not not_feeling feeling_real real_good good_about about_yourself yourself_.
 and_so so_.
 okay_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 mm_.
 i_see see_.
 right_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.

 did_you you_wonder wonder_what what_that that_was was_all all_about about_.
 okay_.
 okay_alright alright_well well_one one_of of_the the_things things_he he_did did_with with_the the_total total_numbers numbers_was was_to to_add add_it it_up up_and and_score score_you you_on on_a a_dast dast_score score_.

 and_so so_looking looking_at at_what what_other other_people people_have have_and and_the the_way way_you you_responded responded_to to_the the_answers answers_it it_kinda kinda_puts puts_you you_at at_a a_seven seven_which which_is is_up up_here here_at at_the the_top top_of of_the the_pyramid pyramid_.
 does_that that_surprise surprise_you you_.
 uh-huh_.
 mm-hmm_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_tell tell_me me_about about_that that_.
 tell_me me_what what_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_as as_far far_as as_trying trying_to to_control control_it it_.
 and_first first_of of_all all_what what_is is_it it_to to_control control_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 uh-huh_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 how_long long_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_good good_so so_tell tell_me me_you you_described described_it it_as as_an an_addiction addiction_.
 do_you you_believe believe_that that_you you_have have_an an_addiction addiction_right right_now now_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_so so_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_different different_today today_.
 why_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_you you_want want_to to_.
 go_out out_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_i i_wanna wanna_see see_if if_i i_can can_get get_directed directed_the the_right right_way way_i i_&apos;ve &apos;ve_never never_spoke spoke_to to_a a_social social_worker worker_or or_a a_case case_manager manager_or or_nothing nothing_like like_that that_mental mental_evaluation evaluation_counselor counselor_or or_nothing nothing_.
 uh-huh_uh-huh uh-huh_.
 okay_but but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_are are_days days_that that_when when_you you_choose choose_not not_to to_use use_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_going going_on on_within within_you you_that that_makes makes_you you_decide decide_today today_isn isn_&apos;t &apos;t_gonna gonna_be be_the the_day day_.
 mm-hmm_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_that that_today today_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_choosing choosing_not not_to to_use use_that that_it it_has has_to to_do do_with with_you you_wanting wanting_to to_remain remain_healthy healthy_and and_you you_want want_to to_remain remain_intelligent intelligent_so so_that that_if if_that that_opportunity opportunity_for for_a a_job job_should should_come come_up up_you you_can can_take take_it it_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_well well_those those_are are_good good_strong strong_reasons reasons_huh huh_.
 mm-hmm_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.
 so_what what_are are_the the_advantages advantages_of of_that that_for for_you you_what what_.
 mm-hmm_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 wow_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 uh-huh_.
 right_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_well well_what what_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_talking talking_about about_in in_this this_particular particular_study study_right right_now now_is is_just just_to to_see see_what what_you you_have have_used used_in in_your your_daily daily_life life_as as_cues cues_to to_use use_or or_to to_not not_use use_and and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_one one_of of_the the_things things_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_looking looking_at at_right right_now now_.
 when_i i_ask ask_you you_like like_today today_you you_see see_health health_as as_being being_very very_important important_to to_you you_and and_being being_sharp sharp_and and_being being_able able_to to_get get_that that_job job_is is_very very_important important_to to_you you_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_also also_meeting meeting_with with_your your_family family_and and_getting getting_back back_connected connected_with with_them them_is is_very very_important important_to to_you you_.
 so_now now_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_maybe maybe_talk talk_about about_.
 on_the the_days days_you you_do do_use use_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_on on_.
 no_i i_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_just just_gonna gonna_talk talk_about about_this this_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 well_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 well_.
 no_i i_thought thought_we we_could could_just just_talk talk_for for_a a_few few_minutes minutes_about about_your your_drug drug_use use_and and_what what_goes goes_on on_.
 which_is is_why why_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_kind kind_of of_exploring exploring_some some_of of_.
 what_are are_the the_things things_that that_.
 okay_well well_well well_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_talk talk_.
 let_&apos;s &apos;s_talk talk_about about_the the_things things_that that_on on_the the_days days_that that_you you_do do_use use_if if_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_okay okay_with with_you you_.
 is_that that_okay okay_with with_you you_if if_we we_continue continue_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 uh-huh_.
 what_would would_you you_like like_us us_to to_be be_doing doing_right right_now now_.
 uh-huh_.
 okay_.
 so_.
 so_you you_.
 well_i i_.
 wasn_&apos;t &apos;t_planning planning_on on_going going_.
 for_an an_hour hour_.
 yeah_well well_we we_&apos;ve &apos;ve_probably probably_been been_talking talking_about about_ten ten_minutes minutes_.
 and_it it_.
 yeah_.
 well_the the_twenty twenty_minutes minutes_is is_probably probably_what what_would would_be be_with with_me me_.
 alright_.
 well_we we_can can_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_all all_done done_talking talking_about about_this this_now now_.
 we_&apos;re &apos;re_just just_gonna gonna_talk talk_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_just just_gonna gonna_talk talk_this this_is is_what what_joey joey_asked asked_you you_.
 these_are are_some some_of of_the the_things things_you you_circled circled_.
 right_.
 uh-huh_.
 is_that that_okay okay_.
 no_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_probably probably_.
 well_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_trying trying_to to_help help_you you_and and_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_look look_at at_what what_are are_positive positive_reasons reasons_for for_you you_when when_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_use use_and and_then then_again again_what what_are are_things things_that that_are are_going going_on on_letting letting_you you_explore explore_what what_some some_of of_your your_thoughts thoughts_on on_.
 really_.
 who_have have_you you_gone gone_over over_it it_with with_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_does does_it it_get get_you you_.
 sounds_like like_it it_gets gets_you you_upset upset_talking talking_.
 uh-huh_uh-huh uh-huh_.
 okay_.
 okay_but but_again again_if if_we we_could could_kinda kinda_go go_back back_and and_because because_we we_looked looked_at at_the the_positive positive_things things_that that_you you_see see_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_using using_.
 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_some some_really really_positive positive_strong strong_things things_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_told told_me me_about about_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_using using_.
 but_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_really really_clear clear_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_about about_when when_you you_do do_go go_out out_to to_use use_.
 so_it it_does does_it it_make make_you you_unhealthy unhealthy_.
 does_it it_just just_kind kind_of of_see see_what what_your your_cues cues_are are_what what_gets gets_you you_to to_decide decide_to to_use use_.
 okay_.
 uh-huh_.
 mm-hmm_.

 really_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 that_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_frustrating frustrating_for for_you you_.
 uh-huh_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_how how_did did_you you_cope cope_with with_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_.
 when_you you_talk talk_about about_your your_addiction addiction_you you_were were_talking talking_about about_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_some some_times times_when when_you you_do do_have have_to to_use use_or or_.
 when_did did_you you_last last_use use_.
 okay_what what_was was_going going_on on_yesterday yesterday_.
 mm-hmm_how how_did did_that that_make make_you you_feel feel_.
 did_you you_know know_what what_did did_you you_have have_some some_feeling feeling_when when_you you_went went_out out_to to_get get_your your_drugs drugs_.
 or_was was_there there_something something_going going_on on_that that_day day_or or_.
 no_.
 no_.
 but_today today_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_better better_about about_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 just_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_work work_.
 so_you you_want want_something something_.

 uh-huh_.
 so_you you_want want_to to_go go_into into_treatment treatment_.
 you_wanna wanna_talk talk_about about_going going_into into_treatment treatment_.
 so_what what_do do_you you_think think_would would_be be_proper proper_for for_you you_then then_.
 okay_.

 uh-huh_.
 what_.
 don_&apos;t &apos;t_approve approve_of of_what what_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 how_would would_somebody somebody_do do_something something_about about_it it_.
 tell_me me_what what_you you_mean mean_by by_that that_.
 because_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_really really_clear clear_.
 i_mean mean_you you_just just_told told_me me_that that_you you_really really_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_if if_you you_want want_inpatient inpatient_treatment treatment_or or_if if_you you_want want_any any_treatment treatment_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_feel feel_like like_you you_can can_stop stop_yourself yourself_.
 okay_.
 and_yet yet_today today_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_using using_and and_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_feel feel_like like_using using_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_so so_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_turning turning_point point_.
 i_guess guess_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_trying trying_to to_see see_is is_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_turning turning_point point_.
 if_you you_can can_go go_a a_few few_weeks weeks_and and_there there_must must_be be_some some_trigger trigger_there there_that that_makes makes_you you_turn turn_to to_it it_.
 you_can can_have have_.
 this_this this_is is_the the_paperwork paperwork_he he_gave gave_me me_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_but but_this this_is is_all all_i i_get get_from from_him him_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_welcome welcome_to to_it it_.
 because_it it_just just_.
 i_know know_.
 and_this this_is is_.
 and_this this_is is_part part_of of_the the_study study_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_get get_to to_see see_i i_only only_get get_this this_and and_this this_.
 and_so so_i i_have have_to to_ask ask_you you_some some_of of_the the_questions questions_as as_part part_of of_the the_study study_.
 am_i i_asking asking_the the_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_honestly honestly_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_because because_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_the the_whole whole_thing thing_that that_he he_does does_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 tell_me me_.
 why_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_disappointed disappointed_though though_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_really really_clear clear_because because_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 so_.
 okay_.
 well_.
 you_know know_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_gonna gonna_just just_give give_you you_this this_.
 do_you you_want want_to to_continue continue_in in_the the_study study_because because_he he_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_call call_i i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_call call_you you_back back_he he_&apos;ll &apos;ll_call call_you you_back back_i i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_just just_talk talk_to to_you you_on on_the the_phone phone_.
 probably_in in_a a_couple couple_weeks weeks_.
 i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_call call_you you_in in_a a_couple couple_weeks weeks_then then_he he_&apos;ll &apos;ll_call call_you you_in in_three three_months months_.
 my_.
 my_hope hope_is is_that that_you you_and and_i i_could could_come come_up up_with with_a a_solution solution_and and_maybe maybe_you you_could could_talk talk_to to_me me_a a_bit bit_more more_.
 because_i i_.
 you_.
 this_is is_a a_study study_again again_as as_i i_said said_before before_.
 and_i i_appreciate appreciate_you you_agreeing agreeing_to to_it it_.
 but_part part_of of_the the_study study_is is_to to_kind kind_of of_work work_on on_the the_questions questions_i i_ask ask_.
 and_he he_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_what what_you you_and and_i i_talk talk_about about_either either_because because_it it_is is_a a_study study_and and_it it_has has_to to_so so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_the the_interventionist interventionist_he he_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_person person_who who_helps helps_gather gather_the the_information information_and and_the the_people people_who who_qualify qualify_and and_that that_part part_of of_it it_.
 oh_yeah yeah_and and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_.
 really_clear clear_what what_.
 with_family family_.
 okay_.
 so_.
 who_else else_have have_you you_talked talked_about about_it it_with with_.
 okay_so so_people people_in in_your your_life life_.
 and_you you_care care_about about_.
 and_yet yet_you you_also also_told told_me me_that that_you you_really really_hadn hadn_&apos;t &apos;t_talked talked_to to_anybody anybody_about about_it it_when when_we we_first first_spoke spoke_.
 so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_.

 and_how how_do do_you you_mean mean_resolve resolve_it it_.
 yeah_.
 so_what what_you you_want want_is is_a a_magic magic_something something_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_to to_stop stop_it it_from from_happening happening_.
 is_it it_.
 okay_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_right right_.
 so_but but_so so_.
 tell_me me_one one_of of_the the_somethings somethings_that that_you you_think think_would would_take take_care care_of of_the the_problem problem_.
 can_you you_tell tell_me me_what what_your your_expectation expectation_is is_.
 because_then then_we we_can can_talk talk_about about_that that_.
 okay_so so_if if_talking talking_won won_&apos;t &apos;t_take take_care care_of of_it it_what what_will will_take take_care care_of of_it it_.
 right_.
 right_and and_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_of of_anything anything_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_take take_care care_of of_it it_until until_we we_explore explore_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 i_think think_the the_thing thing_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_take take_care care_of of_it it_is is_inside inside_of of_you you_and and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_explore explore_.
 you_know know_because because_nobody nobody_is is_with with_you you_twenty twenty_four four_hours hours_a a_day day_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_you you_and and_your your_thoughts thoughts_.
 do_you you_agree agree_or or_.
 well_i i_think think_us us_talking talking_about about_it it_and and_maybe maybe_you you_having having_thoughts thoughts_about about_it it_might might_help help_.

 but_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_to to_chew chew_on on_.
 but_i i_&apos;ve &apos;ve_heard heard_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_said said_the the_reasons reasons_you you_wanna wanna_make make_a a_change change_was was_because because_you you_wanna wanna_have have_a a_life life_worth worth_living living_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_tired tired_of of_getting getting_yourself yourself_in in_these these_situations situations_where where_you you_get get_hurt hurt_and and_bad bad_stuff stuff_happens happens_scary scary_things things_happen happen_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_real real_clearly clearly_that that_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_for for_you you_and and_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_confident confident_that that_you you_can can_do do_it it_.

 i_&apos;m &apos;m_really really_just just_here here_to to_talk talk_to to_you you_about about_your your_drug drug_use use_.
 okay_.
 okay_so so_it it_looks looks_like like_this this_questionnaire questionnaire_you you_filled filled_out out_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_called called_the the_drug drug_abuse abuse_screening screening_test test_.
 based_on on_your your_answers answers_to to_that that_questionnaire questionnaire_you you_fell fell_in in_the the_moderate moderate_risk risk_of of_harm harm_.
 so_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_no no_risk risk_some some_risk risk_moderate moderate_risk risk_and and_then then_severe severe_risk risk_.
 okay_you you_fell fell_in in_this this_right right_here here_this this_range range_.
 what_do do_you you_think think_about about_that that_.
 what_do do_you you_think think_about about_the the_results results_.
 you_seem seem_a a_little little_surprised surprised_.
 okay_tell tell_me me_more more_.
 tell_me me_more more_about about_that that_.
 okay_so so_it it_looks looks_like like_your your_drug drug_of of_choice choice_is is_what what_marijuana marijuana_and and_alcohol alcohol_.
 okay_well well_tell tell_me me_about about_that that_.
 tell_me me_about about_your your_use use_.
 okay_.
 okay_and and_so so_do do_you you_use use_weed weed_and and_alcohol alcohol_then then_every every_day day_.
 okay_can can_you you_give give_me me_an an_example example_of of_when when_you you_do do_use use_it it_.
 and_then then_when when_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_use use_it it_.
 okay_you you_said said_it it_depends depends_on on_your your_mood mood_right right_.
 okay_so so_even even_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_both both_in in_a a_bad bad_mood mood_and and_good good_mood mood_you you_use use_it it_you you_use use_it it_anyways anyways_.
 okay_because because_you you_said said_earlier earlier_that that_it it_depends depends_on on_how how_you you_feel feel_the the_amount amount_that that_you you_use use_and and_how how_long long_you you_use use_.
 okay_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_pretty pretty_much much_use use_it it_then then_no no_matter matter_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_good good_or or_bad bad_or or_in in_between between_.
 you_use use_it it_anyways anyways_.
 what_were were_you you_using using_back back_then then_.
 so_you you_say say_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_stopped stopped_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_sober sober_from from_clean clean_and and_sober sober_from from_coke coke_for for_at at_least least_thirty thirty_years years_.
 wow_.
 boy_what what_was was_that that_like like_using using_it it_back back_then then_.
 so_yeah yeah_what what_was was_it it_that that_made made_you you_stop stop_.
 okay_did did_you you_.
 how_did did_you you_do do_that that_.
 okay_.
 okay_so so_did did_coke coke_in in_any any_way way_interfere interfere_with with_your your_life life_.
 okay_do do_you you_feel feel_that that_using using_pot pot_and and_drinking drinking_do do_you you_think think_that that_interferes interferes_at at_all all_with with_your your_life life_.
 well_what what_do do_you you_see see_are are_some some_of of_the the_good good_things things_about about_using using_and and_some some_of of_the the_bad bad_things things_.
 say_if if_you you_were were_to to_pick pick_one one_between between_alcohol alcohol_and and_marijuana marijuana_which which_one one_would would_you you_be be_using using_.
 okay_so so_with with_pot pot_.
 do_you you_have have_a a_preference preference_as as_to to_one one_.
 okay_so so_what what_do do_you you_see see_are are_some some_good good_things things_about about_using using_pot pot_.
 and_what what_are are_some some_bad bad_negative negative_things things_about about_using using_pot pot_.
 okay_okay okay_um-hmm um-hmm_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_cheap cheap_right right_.
 okay_and and_do do_you you_see see_any any_other other_negative negative_.
 um-hum_.
 well_tell tell_me me_about about_the the_good good_things things_.
 so_it it_helps helps_relaxes relaxes_you you_and and_makes makes_you you_feel feel_better better_.
 okay_so so_on on_the the_one one_hand hand_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_that that_.
 okay_.
 okay_so so_on on_one one_hand hand_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_that that_you you_know know_on on_the the_positive positive_side side_of of_using using_pot pot_it it_calms calms_your your_nerves nerves_and and_sort sort_of of_makes makes_you you_more more_even even_even even_mood mood_right right_.
 what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_is is_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_think think_that that_should should_be be_a a_good good_enough enough_reason reason_to to_be be_using using_marijuana marijuana_and and_then then_on on_the the_negative negative_side side_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_costly costly_.
 you_know know_well well_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_for for_you you_to to_use use_though though_.
 okay_so so_if if_you you_were were_able able_to to_leave leave_it it_you you_know know_what what_would would_that that_look look_like like_.
 okay_so so_you you_okay okay_so so_you you_would would_stop stop_if if_your your_for for_example example_your your_employer employer_is is_gonna gonna_is is_gonna gonna_ua ua_you you_.
 so_you you_would would_stop stop_because because_you you_now now_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_risk risk_right right_and and_being being_found found_out out_.
 okay_well well_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_good good_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_glad glad_to to_hear hear_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_work work_and and_you you_know know_you you_care care_about about_your your_job job_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_big big_thing thing_.
 and_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_using using_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_work work_.
 what_do do_you you_do do_for for_a a_living living_.
 okay_do do_you you_like like_your your_job job_.
 okay_yeah yeah_great great_great great_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_good good_to to_hear hear_it it_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_important important_to to_your your_job job_is is_.
 because_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_using using_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_there there_and and_you you_care care_about about_what what_happens happens_to to_you you_right right_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_also also_saying saying_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_you you_really really_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_care care_if if_anyone anyone_else else_.
 i_thought thought_so so_.
 so_keeping keeping_your your_job job_is is_.
 okay_okay okay_all all_right right_so so_at at_this this_point point_on on_a a_scale scale_of of_one one_to to_ten ten_.
 ten_is is_the the_highest highest_.
 how_important important_is is_it it_for for_you you_to to_continue continue_using using_.
 okay_.
 can_you you_tell tell_me me_more more_about about_that that_.
 why_would would_it it_be be_half half_.
 um-hum_.
 okay_.
 so_if if_you you_were were_.
 what_things things_would would_force force_you you_to to_quit quit_you you_think think_.
 okay_so so_a a_lot lot_of of_it it_really really_has has_to to_do do_with with_your your_ability ability_to to_earn earn_money money_right right_.
 and_income income_.
 is_that that_right right_.
 okay_how how_do do_you you_think think_using using_pot pot_is is_linked linked_to to_your your_health health_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_being being_seen seen_at at_family family_medicine medicine_clinic clinic_.
 what_brought brought_you you_into into_the the_clinic clinic_today today_.
 your_back back_.
 okay_okay okay_so so_how how_long long_have have_you you_had had_back back_problems problems_.
 okay_did did_you you_get get_that that_from from_an an_injury injury_or or_.
 okay_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_a a_couple couple_years years_since since_your your_back back_started started_hurting hurting_and and_it it_comes comes_on on_and and_off off_.
 do_you you_take take_anything anything_for for_that that_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_doctor doctor_say say_about about_it it_.
 okay_okay okay_so so_you you_what what_do do_you you_think think_about about_marijuana marijuana_and and_your your_back back_issue issue_.
 do_you you_think think_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_linked linked_at at_all all_your your_marijuana marijuana_and and_.
 okay_you you_said said_earlier earlier_that that_the the_marijuana marijuana_sort sort_of of_relaxes relaxes_you you_right right_.
 puts_you you_in in_a a_better better_or or_an an_even even_more more_mood mood_.
 does_it it_help help_too too_with with_the the_muscle-relaxing muscle-relaxing_piece piece_of of_it it_.
 on_what what_.
 um-hum_well well_do do_you you_have have_any any_other other_health health_problems problems_.
 um-hum_.
 so_you you_said said_you you_have have_asthma asthma_.
 okay_so so_you you_see see_a a_doctor doctor_for for_that that_.
 oh_you you_do do_have have_an an_inhaler inhaler_okay okay_.
 yeah_some some_people people_develop develop_it it_when when_they they_become become_adults adults_.
 yeah_no no_you you_can can_get get_it it_as as_an an_adult adult_too too_.
 so_do do_you you_see see_a a_link link_at at_all all_with with_using using_marijuana marijuana_and and_having having_asthma asthma_.
 okay_well well_can can_i i_share share_with with_you you_what what_i i_know know_about about_that that_.
 well_you you_know know_cigarettes cigarettes_are are_not not_good good_for for_you you_right right_.
 smoking_at at_all all_is is_not not_good good_for for_you you_.
 but_i i_believe believe_that that_with with_marijuana marijuana_the the_impact impact_on on_your your_lungs lungs_and and_respiratory respiratory_is is_much much_more more_worse worse_than than_smoking smoking_cigarettes cigarettes_so so_that that_will will_affect affect_how how_you you_breathe breathe_.
 so_if if_you you_want want_to to_know know_more more_about about_that that_you you_can can_talk talk_to to_your your_doctor doctor_too too_.
 i_mean mean_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_always always_there there_.
 and_i i_hope hope_you you_have have_a a_relationship relationship_with with_your your_doctor doctor_.
 okay_so so_mister mister_garcia garcia_if if_the the_time time_were were_right right_.
 right_now now_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_fifty fifty_fifty fifty_between between_quitting quitting_and and_not not_quitting quitting_.
 um_what what_would would_you you_do do_.
 if_the the_time time_were were_right right_to to_stop stop_using using_what what_would would_you you_do do_.
 what_would would_that that_look look_like like_.
 okay_so so_it it_would would_take take_.
 okay_so so_unless unless_they they_were were_your your_employer employer_right right_.
 unless_you you_feel feel_like like_it it_would would_be be_too too_risky risky_depending depending_on on_the the_good good_jobs jobs_and and_.
 okay_and and_then then_that that_brings brings_back back_again again_to to_your your_ideal ideal_or or_how how_much much_you you_value value_your your_job job_as as_an an_important important_part part_of of_your your_life life_.
 is_that that_right right_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 okay_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_really really_cautious cautious_about about_making making_sure sure_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_caught caught_right right_.
 okay_okay okay_so so_.
 okay_so so_the the_legal legal_possibilities possibilities_concerns concerns_you you_if if_you you_were were_to to_get get_caught caught_.
 have_you you_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_have have_you you_been been_there there_before before_.
 okay_okay okay_so so_.
 okay_.
 okay_well well_yeah yeah_right right_i i_mean mean_you you_haven haven_&apos;t &apos;t_learned learned_your your_lesson lesson_as as_you you_say say_in in_your your_own own_words words_.
 because_you you_still still_use use_it it_right right_.
 and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_still still_talking talking_about about_not not_caring caring_unless unless_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_job job_related related_.
 okay_well well_how how_many many_times times_were were_you you_busted busted_i i_guess guess_in in_the the_past past_.
 two_times times_okay okay_.
 and_what what_happened happened_then then_.
 okay_so so_you you_were were_smoking smoking_pot pot_both both_times times_.
 in_public public_.
 were_you you_arrested arrested_.
 and_did did_you you_end end_up up_going going_to to_court court_.
 what_happened happened_there there_.
 okay_so so_one one_of of_the the_cases cases_got got_dismissed dismissed_.
 what_about about_the the_other other_one one_.
 okay_does does_it it_concern concern_you you_at at_all all_worry worry_at at_all all_if if_say say_a a_third third_time time_happens happens_and and_.
 and_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_more more_.
 of_repercussions repercussions_.
 okay_.
 okay_two two_years years_ago ago_was was_the the_last last_time time_.
 um-hmm_honesty honesty_is is_good good_and and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_surely surely_been been_honest honest_with with_me me_today today_.
 so_i i_do do_appreciate appreciate_that that_.
 okay_so so_at at_this this_point point_the the_way way_i i_see see_it it_then then_is is_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kind kind_of of_thinking thinking_about about_changing changing_or or_stopping stopping_using using_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_that that_unless unless_it it_impacts impacts_your your_job job_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_going going_to to_stop stop_.
 did_i i_get get_that that_right right_.
 okay_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_also also_concerned concerned_about about_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_the the_job job_thing thing_is is_always always_a a_goal goal_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_looking looking_at at_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_to to_get get_a a_better better_job job_.
 are_you you_looking looking_for for_other other_work work_then then_or or_.
 okay_okay okay_but but_here here_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_thing thing_you you_always always_have have_choices choices_right right_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_an an_adult adult_you you_have have_choices choices_so so_you you_can can_either either_manage manage_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_instead instead_of of_doing doing_it it_every every_day day_.
 you_do do_it it_every every_other other_day day_or or_you you_know know_manage manage_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_going going_to to_use use_it it_use use_it it_less less_frequently frequently_.
 you_could could_quit quit_altogether altogether_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_other other_option option_.
 sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_sort sort_of of_not not_there there_yet yet_at at_this this_point point_.
 take_less less_risks risks_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_.
 have_you you_thought thought_about about_that that_sort sort_of of_unsafety unsafety_when when_you you_are are_using using_.
 okay_so so_you you_do do_do do_it it_at at_home home_.
 okay_do do_you you_get get_behind behind_the the_wheel wheel_.
 do_you you_drive drive_.
 okay_do do_you you_watch watch_kids kids_when when_you you_are are_high high_.
 okay_you you_look look_out out_right right_.
 when_you you_say say_you you_look look_out out_what what_do do_you you_look look_out out_for for_.
 okay_but but_you you_say say_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_driving driving_.
 okay_any any_other other_choices choices_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_make make_no no_changes changes_.
 you_like like_things things_.
 the_other other_choice choice_you you_have have_also also_is is_that that_you you_make make_no no_changes changes_.
 you_sort sort_of of_leave leave_things things_where where_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_.
 and_then then_your your_other other_your your_fifth fifth_choice choice_is is_to to_get get_some some_help help_.
 you_know know_that that_right right_.
 okay_so so_yeah yeah_i i_mean mean_you you_have have_the the_power power_to to_to to_make make_you you_have have_the the_power power_and and_the the_choices choices_to to_think think_about about_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_you you_do do_with with_it it_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_up up_to to_you you_.
 so_what what_i i_did did_want want_to to_do do_is is_give give_you you_this this_resource resource_list list_of of_places places_to to_seek seek_help help_.
 if_that that_fifth fifth_choice choice_is is_what what_you you_want want_to to_do do_.
 okay_because because_i i_think think_you you_know know_ultimately ultimately_the the_risk risk_i i_mean mean_the the_point point_is is_to to_take take_you you_from from_this this_moderate moderate_risk risk_and and_bring bring_you you_down down_to to_really really_sort sort_of of_no no_risk risk_.
 right_because because_this this_questionnaire questionnaire_right right_here here_this this_d d_a a_s s_t t_score score_triangle triangle_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_looking looking_at at_.
 the_higher higher_you you_go go_up up_on on_this this_triangle triangle_that that_means means_the the_more more_at at_risk risk_you you_&apos;ll &apos;ll_be be_.
 you_&apos;ll &apos;ll_be be_more more_likely likely_to to_get get_to to_develop develop_health health_problems problems_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_more more_likely likely_to to_get get_into into_legal legal_situations situations_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_more more_likely likely_to to_affect affect_your your_mental mental_health health_emotional emotional_well well_being being_.
 the_higher higher_you you_go go_up up_on on_this this_triangle triangle_.

 really_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_difficult difficult_too too_.
 okay_.
 does_.
 oh_okay okay_.
 just_overall overall_.
 wow_so so_you you_got got_to to_the the_point point_where where_you you_realized realized_i i_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_this this_anymore anymore_.
 really_so so_the the_past past_three three_months months_or or_so so_you you_were were_saying saying_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_.
 yeah_.
 so_basically basically_you you_quit quit_your your_job job_so so_to to_speak speak_.
 well_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_great great_but but_so so_.
 ah-ha_okay okay_.
 mental_health health_here here_.
 sound_mental mental_health health_okay okay_.
 i_know know_it it_.
 is_here here_.
 um-hum_.
 how_did did_you you_hook hook_up up_with with_sound sound_.
 oh_i i_know know_him him_.

 good_for for_you you_.
 yeah_no no_good good_for for_you you_.
 how_did did_you you_happen happen_to to_be be_in in_the the_rehab rehab_clinic clinic_.
 ah_you you_think think_it it_wasn wasn_&apos;t &apos;t_even even_the the_right right_place place_.
 no_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_interesting interesting_.
 because_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_look look_you you_have have_many many_physical physical_or or_even even_cognitive cognitive_.
 oh_i i_see see_but but_that that_would would_be be_almost almost_more more_of of_physical physical_yeah yeah_physical physical_therapy therapy_.
 maybe_it it_was was_meant meant_to to_be be_huh huh_.
 wow_.
 but_josh josh_is is_good good_too too_.
 yeah_josh josh_is is_very very_good good_.
 and_.
 okay_so so_you you_actually actually_have have_the the_advantage advantage_of of_double double_support support_.
 do_you you_know know_why why_joshua joshua_referred referred_you you_to to_sound sound_versus versus_here here_.
 here_.
 um-hum_.
 yes_.
 yes_uh-huh uh-huh_.
 yeah_.

 no_but but_did did_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_good good_hands hands_with with_sound sound_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_that that_like like_the the_psychiatry psychiatry_department department_here here_is is_more more_a a_consultation consultation_basis basis_to to_see see_what what_your your_needs needs_are are_.
 and_then then_as as_joshua joshua_did did_referral referral_.
 they_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_the the_capacity capacity_to to_do do_it it_ongoing ongoing_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_good good_hands hands_with with_sound sound_.

 okay_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_a a_good good_place place_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_a a_good good_place place_right right_now now_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 it_was was_very very_very very_fortunate fortunate_that that_you you_hooked hooked_up up_on on_rehab rehab_and and_joshua joshua_and and_now now_sound sound_and and_things things_kind kind_of of_fell fell_into into_place place_for for_you you_.
 oh_okay okay_okay okay_.
 and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_helped helped_so so_your your_spirituality spirituality_.
 helpful_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 aw_.
 oh_but but_it it_did did_eventually eventually_.
 so_tell tell_me me_is is_there there_anything anything_else else_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_thinking thinking_about about_that that_might might_be be_helpful helpful_to to_you you_.
 or_is is_there there_anything anything_else else_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_already already_tried tried_.
 housing_.
 mm_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_staying staying_in in_shelters shelters_.
 you_have have_income income_though though_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_you you_.
 yeah_because because_of of_your your_j j_.
 you_have have_j j_a a_x x_right right_.
 is_that that_what what_you you_were were_trying trying_to to_.
 because_you you_went went_from from_g g_g g_a a_u u_to to_j j_a a_x x_.
 all_right right_.
 okay_okay okay_.
 um-hum_.
 um-hum_.

 i_mean mean_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_already already_but but_housing housing_would would_just just_be be_like like_the the_would would_be be_the the_coup coup_de de_gras gras_as as_they they_say say_.
 well_you you_know know_if if_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_i i_mean mean_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_this this_clinic clinic_now now_adult adult_medicine medicine_.
 the_social social_workers workers_here here_can can_help help_you you_with with_that that_.
 because_we we_know know_you you_know know_housing housing_is is_just just_one one_of of_the the_few few_things things_the the_social social_workers workers_deal deal_with with_.
 um_what what_i i_could could_do do_is is_i i_had had_mentioned mentioned_earlier earlier_that that_i i_was was_helping helping_one one_of of_my my_staff staff_out out_.

 do_you you_have have_.
 oh_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_a a_contact contact_phone phone_because because_joey joey_took took_that that_down down_from from_you you_right right_.
 because_i i_agree agree_housing housing_is is_huge huge_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_huge huge_.
 okay_.
 okay_yeah yeah_and and_two two_things things_right right_there there_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_yeah yeah_exactly exactly_.
 oh_yeah yeah_.
 do_you you_do do_you you_have have_to to_leave leave_during during_the the_day day_.
 and_you you_do do_still still_huh huh_.

 are_you you_at at_angeline angeline_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 uh-huh_.
 okay_.

 have_you you_okay okay_.
 and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_you you_were were_just just_talking talking_about about_the the_fact fact_that that_you you_need need_housing housing_.
 to_get get_away away_from from_that that_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.

 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_definitely definitely_reached reached_that that_point point_where where_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_enough enough_is is_enough enough_you you_know know_.
 so_when when_you you_pursue pursue_housing housing_do do_you you_need need_to to_have have_your your_fiance fiance_with with_you you_.
 oh_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_.
 no_okay okay_.

 and_there there_might might_be be_something something_else else_you you_know know_along along_the the_lines lines_of of_cooper cooper_house house_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_actually actually_familiar familiar_with with_cooper cooper_house house_myself myself_.
 i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_if if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_transitional transitional_setting setting_or or_a a_.

 but_imagine imagine_where where_you you_head head_would would_be be_if if_you you_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_these these_things things_that that_were were_pursuing pursuing_.
 it_would would_be be_empty empty_because because_those those_are are_the the_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_huge huge_that that_.

 and_this this_is is_for for_you you_to to_keep keep_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_based based_on on_the the_dast dast_.
 did_he he_tell tell_you you_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_the the_dast dast_.
 the_drug drug_and and_alcohol alcohol_and and_risk risk_.
 because_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_based based_on on_you you_know know_what what_how how_much much_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_and and_what what_your your_risks risks_are are_to to_your your_living living_situation situation_to to_your your_medical medical_health health_and and_some some_of of_the the_stresses stresses_that that_drug drug_use use_may may_be be_causing causing_.
 so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_how how_they they_kind kind_of of_figure figure_it it_out out_.
 so_does does_this this_surprise surprise_you you_at at_all all_or or_.
 hmm_why why_can can_you you_tell tell_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_that that_or or_.
 you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_think think_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_a a_hard-core hard-core_drug drug_person person_.
 okay_tell tell_me me_who who_is is_a a_hard-core hard-core_drug drug_person person_.
 what_would would_make make_somebody somebody_.
 mm_.
 uh-huh_uh-huh uh-huh_.
 the_means means_being being_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_ever ever_have have_to to_do do_that that_.
 okay_so so_tell tell_me me_about about_how how_you you_use use_drugs drugs_.
 hmm_.
 if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_available available_.
 yeah_.
 you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_go go_looking looking_for for_it it_so so_just just_if if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_available available_.
 so_are are_you you_able able_to to_get get_drugs drugs_for for_free free_from from_people people_that that_you you_know know_.
 okay_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_.
 yeah_i i_would would_think think_that that_it it_might might_be be_a a_little little_hard hard_to to_have have_that that_happen happen_a a_lot lot_.
 uh-huh_so so_you you_never never_have have_to to_seek seek_out out_any any_drugs drugs_they they_just just_happen happen_to to_be be_around around_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_when when_you you_do do_have have_money money_though though_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_might might_be be_some some_times times_that that_you you_might might_.
 you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_seek seek_it it_.
 okay_well well_tell tell_me me_about about_when when_why why_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_that that_anymore anymore_.
 well_.
 you_said said_you you_have have_been been_a a_person person_that that_sought sought_drugs drugs_in in_the the_past past_.
 is_that that_.
 &apos;_cause cause_you you_said said_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_you you_used used_to to_do do_that that_.
 okay_.
 uh_huh huh_.
 okay_so so_what what_changed changed_.
 what_made made_that that_happen happen_.
 doctor_&apos;s &apos;s_advice advice_.
 so_your your_doctor doctor_.
 uh-huh_so so_which which_drugs drugs_have have_you you_cut cut_back back_on on_.
 the_cocaine cocaine_yeah yeah_that that_will will_definitely definitely_make make_you you_race race_your your_heart heart_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_good good_for for_your your_pain pain_the the_.
 marijuana_so so_you you_sometimes sometimes_use use_marijuana marijuana_for for_pain pain_.
 who_suggested suggested_.
 the_doctor doctor_.
 the_doctor doctor_suggested suggested_that that_you you_use use_marijuana marijuana_for for_pain pain_.
 oh_okay okay_what what_did did_you you_think think_of of_that that_advice advice_.
 and_so so_are are_you you_doing doing_that that_for for_your your_back back_pain pain_.
 oh_.
 bless_you you_.
 okay_so so_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_use use_the the_marijuana marijuana_or or_you you_.
 okay_.
 yeah_well well_marijuana marijuana_has has_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_own own_set set_of of_side side_effects effects_also also_you you_know know_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_cut cut_back back_on on_the the_cocaine cocaine_though though_because because_it it_.
 because_of of_medical medical_advice advice_.
 was_that that_difficult difficult_for for_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 well_then then_and and_are are_you you_happy happy_with with_that that_.
 good_good good_.
 well_some some_.
 well_some some_people people_say say_that that_you you_know know_they they_will will_always always_miss miss_something something_.
 they_&apos;ll &apos;ll_remember remember_whatever whatever_their their_benefit benefit_physical physical_or or_psychological psychological_from from_the the_.
 but_you you_feel feel_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_missing missing_it it_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_have have_more more_important important_things things_your your_apartment apartment_your your_health health_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_social social_.
 so_in in_a a_social social_situation situation_.
 even_when when_you you_have have_the the_apartment apartment_.
 would_you you_have have_people people_over over_to to_your your_apartment apartment_to to_do do_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_so so_having having_your your_own own_housing housing_has has_reduced reduced_what what_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_used used_.
 so_it it_could could_be be_a a_tempting tempting_thing thing_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_out out_on on_the the_street street_and and_homeless homeless_.
 mm_.
 you_say say_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_a a_few few_times times_though though_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_taken taken_it it_to to_the the_apartment apartment_.
 okay_so so_but but_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_times times_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_had had_the the_.
 and_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_on on_then then_.
 what_happens happens_at at_that that_point point_.
 okay_so so_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_with with_somebody somebody_you you_share share_some some_drugs drugs_with with_them them_.
 what_do do_you you_mean mean_trigger trigger_.
 okay_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_have have_dates dates_where where_it it_isn isn_&apos;t &apos;t_there there_.
 um-hum_yeah yeah_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_that that_this this_not not_be be_a a_necessity necessity_to to_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 is_there there_ever ever_a a_time time_it it_does does_feel feel_.
 uh-huh_.
 okay_so so_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_low low_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_depressed depressed_is is_there there_something something_going going_on on_.
 or_are are_you you_just just_feeling feeling_bad bad_about about_yourself yourself_.
 does_that that_are are_you you_feeling feeling_depressed depressed_now now_that that_you you_have have_housing housing_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 playing_on on_the the_computer computer_or or_working working_on on_the the_computer computer_yeah yeah_a a_lot lot_of of_time time_can can_go go_by by_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_on on_the the_computer computer_right right_yeah yeah_yeah yeah_.
 but_when when_you you_have have_a a_date date_that that_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_sound sound_like like_that that_would would_be be_too too_depressing depressing_.
 okay_so so_there there_are are_times times_when when_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 um-hum_um-hum um-hum_.
 what_is is_it it_like like_when when_you you_decide decide_to to_have have_some some_drugs drugs_other other_than than_the the_date date_and and_.
 what_sort sort_of of_situations situations_.
 uh_huh huh_.
 you_participate participate_.
 how_do do_you you_feel feel_when when_you you_do do_that that_.
 do_you you_feel feel_badly badly_about about_that that_.
 or_is is_that that_okay okay_with with_you you_.
 you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_assess assess_it it_like like_that that_.
 how_do do_you you_assess assess_it it_then then_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_part part_of of_your your_social social_.
 is_that that_anything anything_you you_want want_to to_change change_.
 or_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_okay okay_with with_that that_social social_moment moment_or or_.
 do_you you_ever ever_see see_a a_time time_where where_you you_just just_would would_cut cut_it it_off off_.
 yeah_so so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_really really_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_really really_reduced reduced_what what_you you_use use_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_worse worse_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 uh-huh_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_so so_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_see see_future future_social social_&apos; &apos;_cause cause_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_go go_out out_and and_seek seek_it it_you you_just just_have have_social social_situations situations_where where_somebody somebody_might might_come come_by by_or or_you you_have have_a a_date date_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_saying saying_no no_more more_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 so_that that_must must_make make_you you_feel feel_good good_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_just just_to to_kind kind_of of_tell tell_somebody somebody_no no_when when_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_get get_some some_group group_together together_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_has has_there there_been been_a a_reduction reduction_in in_people people_calling calling_you you_about about_it it_.
 uh_huh huh_yeah yeah_so so_now now_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_actively actively_participating participating_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_sort sort_of of_a a_date date_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_feeling feeling_this this_depressed depressed_it it_feels feels_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 no_.
 okay_.
 well_sometimes sometimes_when when_you you_invite invite_somebody somebody_over over_for for_the the_date date_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_expectation expectation_that that_part part_of of_their their_evening evening_out out_is is_to to_have have_some some_cocaine cocaine_.
 okay_.

 okay_.
 um-hum_um-hum um-hum_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_cutting cutting_back back_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 but_if if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_true true_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_to to_say say_that that_.
 you_would would_say say_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_cut cut_way way_back back_.
 and_then then_i i_guess guess_getting getting_back back_to to_the the_question question_i i_asked asked_.
 is_do do_you you_see see_a a_time time_when when_you you_just just_won won_&apos;t &apos;t_use use_it it_at at_all all_.
 you_do do_see see_a a_time time_.
 okay_.
 what_would would_be be_happening happening_in in_your your_life life_if if_that that_were were_to to_happen happen_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 would_you you_have have_to to_make make_any any_changes changes_to to_make make_that that_.
 okay_if if_you you_were were_to to_swear swear_against against_it it_would would_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_if if_it it_became became_troubling troubling_what what_.
 well_again again_.
 so_it it_was was_troubling troubling_before before_.
 it_was was_a a_troubling troubling_situation situation_.
 but_the the_cutting cutting_back back_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_on on_your your_own own_and and_some some_of of_it it_.
 okay_all all_right right_well well_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_good good_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_really really_glad glad_.

 remember_that that_.
 okay_and and_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_research research_questions questions_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_figure figure_out out_see see_if if_certain certain_techniques techniques_work work_.
 and_so so_you you_answered answered_some some_questions questions_yesterday yesterday_that that_was was_scored scored_.

 really_okay okay_well well_i i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_help help_you you_do do_it it_.
 yeah_i i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_help help_you you_.
 okay_so so_you you_answered answered_some some_questions questions_and and_scored scored_between between_i i_think think_zero zero_and and_ten ten_.
 and_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_number number_and and_the the_number number_is is_associated associated_with with_let let_me me_show show_you you_without without_giving giving_it it_all all_away away_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_this this_triangle triangle_so so_here here_&apos;s &apos;s_this this_is is_zero zero_area area_and and_this this_has has_to to_do do_with with_use use_.
 and_then then_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_up up_to to_more more_and and_more more_severe severe_use use_.
 so_what what_number number_do do_you you_think think_you you_had had_.
 uh-huh_.
 right_on on_.
 did_you you_see see_the the_number number_.
 okay_okay okay_okay okay_so so_four four_means means_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_right right_here here_moderate moderate_risk risk_.
 what_do do_you you_think think_about about_that that_.
 well_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_good good_question question_.
 moderate_risk risk_means means_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_see see_no no_risk risk_how how_much much_harm harm_does does_your your_drug drug_use use_expose expose_you you_to to_.
 the_level level_of of_drug drug_use use_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_currently currently_using using_.
 does_that that_makes makes_sense sense_.
 and_it it_says says_here here_alcohol alcohol_marijuana marijuana_.
 is_that that_it it_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_artificial artificial_marijuana marijuana_.
 the_sting sting_.
 what_is is_this this_.
 is_it it_incense incense_.
 what_do do_you you_do do_with with_it it_.
 do_you you_smoke smoke_it it_or or_.
 this_is is_not not_for for_human human_consumption consumption_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_that that_.
 yeah_it it_does does_say say_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_.
 yeah_okay okay_are are_you you_afraid afraid_that that_that that_might might_hurt hurt_your your_brain brain_somehow somehow_.
 no_okay okay_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_think think_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_safe safe_stuff stuff_is is_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_.
 probably_not not_.
 okay_so so_sounds sounds_like like_you you_are are_level level_four four_of of_risk risk_.
 what_do do_you you_think think_about about_that that_.
 sabotaging_who who_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_that that_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_.
 mmmm_okay okay_between between_zero zero_and and_ten ten_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_a a_four four_.
 and_as as_far far_as as_you you_know know_sort sort_of of_the the_amount amount_of of_risk risk_moderate moderate_risk risk_.
 that_you you_have have_and and_you you_think think_and and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_you you_say say_that that_it it_might might_be be_sort sort_of of_so so_the the_concern concern_might might_be be_sabotage sabotage_.
 yeah_well well_you you_have have_yeah yeah_.
 from_zero zero_to to_ten ten_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_risk risk_factor factor_of of_four four_which which_.
 would_put put_you you_in in_the the_moderate moderate_risk risk_range range_that that_the the_amount amount_of of_harm harm_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_is is_like like_moderate moderate_risk risk_.
 okay_.
 okay_so so_moderate moderate_risk risk_means means_what what_harm harm_that that_the the_drug drug_does does_to to_you you_does does_to to_.
 somebody_it it_could could_mean mean_a a_lot lot_of of_different different_things things_like like_socially socially_homelessness homelessness_poor poor_relationships relationships_health health_jail jail_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_that that_.
 what_no no_you you_wanted wanted_me me_to to_explain explain_what what_the the_harm harm_is is_you you_know know_what what_the the_harm harm_.
 yeah_and and_then then_so so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_you you_say say_that that_your your_level level_of of_risk risk_is is_not not_are are_you you_concerned concerned_about about_it it_or or_not not_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_quite quite_sure sure_.
 can_you you_explain explain_that that_.
 okay_it it_sounds sounds_like like_okay okay_so so_how how_important important_is is_it it_for for_you you_to to_change change_any any_of of_your your_drug drug_use use_.
 say_again again_from from_one one_to to_ten ten_ten ten_being being_really really_important important_to to_change change_and and_one one_being being_not not_at at_all all_.
 six_why why_isn isn_&apos;t &apos;t_it it_lower lower_.
 okay_just just_asking asking_.
 okay_okay okay_so so_between between_one one_and and_ten ten_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_a a_six six_.
 and_ten ten_being being_that that_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_to to_change change_.
 okay_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_you you_have have_reasons reasons_but but_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_to to_say say_what what_they they_are are_.
 okay_how how_confident confident_is is_it it_for for_you you_to to_make make_that that_change change_again again_from from_zero zero_or or_one one_to to_ten ten_.
 six_okay okay_so so_you you_feel feel_pretty pretty_confident confident_.
 okay_why why_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_you you_give give_yourself yourself_a a_lower lower_number number_.
 um-hum_.
 so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_you you_say say_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_lot lot_of of_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_about about_joy joy_and and_pain pain_.
 feeling_pretty pretty_sad sad_.
 occasionally_.
 so_on on_a a_scale scale_again again_from from_one one_to to_ten ten_being being_say say_happy happy_is is_ten ten_sad sad_is is_one one_where where_are are_you you_right right_now now_.
 so_pretty pretty_happy happy_.
 okay_and and_so so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_you you_say say_that that_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_do do_you you_smoke smoke_marijuana marijuana_or or_you you_drink drink_alcohol alcohol_pretty pretty_much much_daily daily_.
 um-hum_and and_that that_you you_see see_it it_as as_a a_moderate moderate_risk risk_.
 sort_of of_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_really really_quite quite_sure sure_what what_that that_means means_.
 but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_also also_talking talking_about about_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_for for_you you_to to_change change_this this_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_confident confident_that that_you you_can can_do do_it it_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_high high_up up_there there_.
 okay_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_it it_before before_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_successful successful_in in_the the_past past_in in_making making_that that_change change_and and_you you_know know_it it_sort sort_of of_seems seems_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_you you_could could_do do_if if_you you_want want_to to_do do_it it_but but_right right_now now_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_just just_not not_really really_thinking thinking_about about_if if_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_you you_want want_to to_do do_.
 i_want want_to to_go go_back back_to to_something something_else else_you you_said said_earlier earlier_about about_a a_pitiful pitiful_life life_.
 now_how how_does does_the the_marijuana marijuana_alcohol alcohol_use use_tie tie_into into_pitiful pitiful_life life_.
 did_you you_have have_a a_pitiful pitiful_life life_when when_you you_were were_clean clean_before before_.
 &apos;_cause cause_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_terms terms_not not_my my_terms terms_those those_are are_your your_words words_.
 well_yeah yeah_you you_had had_said said_that that_you you_had had_a a_period period_of of_your your_life life_when when_you you_were were_clean clean_and and_sober sober_.
 yeah_when when_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_using using_the the_stuff stuff_on on_a a_daily daily_basis basis_maybe maybe_you you_cut cut_down down_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_sure sure_.
 but_you you_said said_that that_you you_had had_done done_it it_before before_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_confident confident_you you_can can_do do_it it_again again_.
 and_you you_also also_said said_something something_about about_about about_pitiful pitiful_life life_.
 and_so so_i i_wasn wasn_&apos;t &apos;t_sure sure_how how_much much_of of_the the_use use_is is_tied tied_into into_this this_idea idea_that that_you you_have have_a a_pitiful pitiful_life life_.
 &apos;_cause cause_this this_is is_pretty pretty_strong strong_language language_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_that that_.
 about_what what_.
 okay_well well_you you_know know_you you_have have_different different_options options_of of_what what_you you_could could_do do_.
 you_can can_cut cut_down down_your your_drinking drinking_or or_your your_marijuana marijuana_use use_.
 you_could could_cut cut_out out_both both_of of_them them_the the_marijuana marijuana_and and_alcohol alcohol_.
 you_could could_choose choose_to to_not not_do do_anything anything_where where_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_get get_in in_trouble trouble_.
 you_know know_for for_instance instance_some some_people people_say say_you you_know know_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_gonna gonna_continue continue_drinking drinking_but but_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_gonna gonna_drive drive_or or_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_gonna gonna_or or_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_gonna gonna_continue continue_using using_drugs drugs_but but_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_gonna gonna_drive drive_and and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_going going_to to_go go_to to_this this_one one_neighborhood neighborhood_where where_i i_know know_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_safe safe_because because_i i_want want_to to_have have_all all_my my_functioning functioning_.
 no_but but_you you_know know_like like_doing doing_things things_that that_might might_be be_unsafe unsafe_like like_limiting limiting_marijuana marijuana_use use_or or_alcohol alcohol_use use_to to_where where_you you_feel feel_you you_won won_&apos;t &apos;t_get get_hurt hurt_.
 okay_so so_but but_these these_are are_options options_for for_change change_that that_if if_you you_choose choose_to to_you you_know know_and and_you you_could could_just just_leave leave_it it_as as_it it_is is_do do_nothing nothing_.
 or_you you_can can_also also_get get_some some_help help_to to_help help_you you_with with_change change_.
 and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_through through_you you_know know_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_aa aa_na na_different different_treatment treatment_groups groups_.
 okay_so so_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_you you_say say_.
 can_i i_tell tell_you you_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_.
 sure_.
 okay_i i_&apos;ve &apos;ve_heard heard_you you_say say_that that_you you_drink drink_and and_you you_smoke smoke_marijuana marijuana_kind kind_of of_on on_a a_daily daily_basis basis_.
 pretty_much much_you you_have have_selected selected_placed placed_where where_you you_feel feel_safe safe_and and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_for for_you you_you you_.
 but_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_on on_your your_mind mind_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_about about_.
 and_you you_feel feel_really really_if if_you you_want want_to to_make make_a a_change change_you you_could could_do do_it it_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_high high_up up_there there_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_confident confident_you you_could could_do do_it it_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_it it_in in_the the_past past_.
 um_is is_there there_anything anything_else else_i i_could could_add add_to to_that that_.

 because_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_it it_in in_the the_past past_.

 what_you you_were were_doing doing_for for_a a_long long_time time_.
 yeah_.

 i_understand understand_that that_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_difficult difficult_.
 because_on on_the the_one one_hand hand_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_part part_of of_your your_lifestyle lifestyle_and and_the the_other other_hand hand_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_costing costing_you you_this this_livelihood livelihood_that that_you you_have have_had had_and and_had had_had had_.
 how_do do_you you_feel feel_about about_that that_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 so_do do_you you_feel feel_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_being being_labeled labeled_as as_a a_pot pot_smoker smoker_and and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_bad bad_thing thing_where where_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_thinking thinking_that that_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_bad bad_thing thing_at at_all all_because because_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_so so_helpful helpful_for for_you you_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 uh-huh_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.

 and_is is_there there_anything anything_else else_that that_you you_can can_think think_of of_that that_has has_been been_not not_so so_good good_about about_smoking smoking_marijuana marijuana_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_so so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_decided decided_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_okay okay_with with_making making_that that_sacrifice sacrifice_at at_least least_as as_much much_as as_you you_can can_do do_because because_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_legal legal_thing thing_yeah yeah_alright alright_.
 so_i i_appreciate appreciate_you you_talking talking_to to_me me_about about_that that_.
 and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_certainly certainly_not not_trying trying_to to_make make_any any_kind kind_of of_judgment judgment_about about_what what_your your_choices choices_are are_.
 um_.
 i_wanted wanted_to to_ask ask_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_interested interested_in in_hearing hearing_the the_results results_of of_one one_of of_the the_tests tests_that that_you you_took took_one one_of of_the the_screening screening_tests tests_that that_you you_took took_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_called called_the the_drug drug_abuse abuse_screening screening_test test_.
 and_it it_rates rates_people people_&apos;s &apos;s_level level_of of_risk risk_from from_drug drug_use use_on on_a a_scale scale_from from_zero zero_to to_ten ten_with with_ten ten_being being_severe severe_risk risk_and and_zero zero_being being_absolutely absolutely_no no_risk risk_.
 and_this this_is is_a a_questionnaire questionnaire_that that_was was_given given_to to_a a_whole whole_bunch bunch_of of_people people_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_supposed supposed_to to_rate rate_how how_much much_risk risk_you you_may may_have have_in in_terms terms_of of_your your_drug drug_use use_.
 and_risk risk_means means_risk risk_for for_health health_problems problems_risk risk_for for_financial financial_problems problems_risk risk_for for_legal legal_problems problems_.
 so_in in_terms terms_of of_how how_you you_answered answered_or or_how how_you you_perceive perceive_or or_how how_you you_see see_your your_level level_of of_risk risk_as as_it it_pertains pertains_to to_your your_drug drug_use use_where where_do do_you you_think think_you you_would would_score score_on on_a a_scale scale_of of_zero zero_which which_means means_no no_risk risk_and and_ten ten_which which_is is_severe severe_risk risk_.
 yeah_what what_do do_you you_think think_.
 uh-huh_.
 no_risk risk_.
 if_you you_think think_about about_it it_in in_terms terms_of of_legal legal_risk risk_risk risk_from from_the the_legal legal_system system_risk risk_for for_financial financial_problems problems_risk risk_for for_health health_problems problems_what what_kind kind_of of_risk risk_do do_you you_think think_you you_might might_.
 yeah_so so_there there_is is_a a_health health_risk risk_component component_.
 yeah_.
 what_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_health health_risk risk_.
 okay_so so_the the_health health_risk risk_to to_marijuana marijuana_is is_overeating overeating_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.
 and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_anxious anxious_to to_see see_your your_provider provider_about about_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_fine fine_.
 okay_alright alright_.
 so_can can_you you_think think_of of_a a_level level_of of_risk risk_that that_you you_may may_perceive perceive_yourself yourself_at at_from from_marijuana marijuana_smoking smoking_just just_in in_terms terms_of of_health health_or or_finances finances_or or_legal legal_or or_any any_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 right_so so_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_little little_bit bit_of of_risk risk_there there_.
 so_.
 and_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_interested interested_to to_see see_how how_the the_screening screening_test test_scored scored_you you_.
 it_has has_you you_at at_a a_number number_two two_which which_is is_some some_risk risk_.
 so_that that_sounds sounds_pretty pretty_accurate accurate_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_little little_bit bit_of of_risk risk_well well_the the_bad bad_or or_good good_is is_it it_sort sort_of of_depends depends_on on_how how_you you_perceive perceive_it it_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_some some_.
 yeah_some some_risk risk_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_low low_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_no no_risk risk_.
 but_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_identified identified_some some_of of_the the_risks risks_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_taking taking_by by_smoking smoking_marijuana marijuana_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_okay okay_with with_taking taking_those those_risks risks_.
 as_far far_as as_you you_can can_be be_i i_mean mean_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 what_would would_have have_to to_go go_bad bad_for for_you you_to to_maybe maybe_think think_about about_wanting wanting_to to_make make_a a_change change_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_if if_restaurant restaurant_companies companies_started started_drug drug_testing testing_that that_might might_be be_a a_reason reason_for for_you you_to to_say say_i i_need need_to to_change change_my my_lifestyle lifestyle_.
 yeah_.
 mm_do do_you you_think think_you you_could could_do do_that that_if if_it it_came came_to to_that that_.
 or_how how_confident confident_are are_you you_that that_you you_could could_make make_that that_change change_.
 right_.
 right_.
 right_.
 on_a a_scale scale_of of_one one_to to_ten ten_with with_zero zero_being being_not not_at at_all all_confident confident_and and_ten ten_being being_the the_most most_confident confident_how how_confident confident_are are_you you_that that_you you_could could_make make_that that_change change_if if_you you_had had_to to_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_.
 i_hear hear_that that_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 eight_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_confident confident_yeah yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_confident confident_you you_could could_change change_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_to to_change change_and and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_to to_yeah yeah_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 have_you you_ever ever_thought thought_about about_what what_it it_would would_take take_to to_quit quit_or or_what what_you you_would would_have have_to to_do do_.
 or_what what_have have_you you_what what_have have_you you_thought thought_about about_in in_terms terms_of of_that that_.
 right_.
 okay_.
 sounds_like like_it it_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_a a_survivor survivor_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.

 the_next next_step step_of of_this this_would would_be be_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hoping hoping_that that_we we_can can_call call_and and_talk talk_again again_in in_a a_week week_just just_on on_the the_phone phone_briefly briefly_.

 okay_i i_will will_call call_you you_in in_a a_week week_.
 is_that that_alright alright_.
 okay_well well_i i_appreciate appreciate_you you_taking taking_the the_time time_to to_talk talk_with with_me me_about about_this this_.
 um_.
 this_is is_for for_you you_.
 yeah_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_gift gift_card card_for for_any any_of of_those those_grocery grocery_stores stores_on on_the the_back back_yeah yeah_.
 okay_so so_we we_have have_the the_recorder recorder_.
 on_and and_like like_i i_mentioned mentioned_i i_am am_social social_worker worker_in in_clinic clinic_.
 my_name name_is is_lauren lauren_.
 and_to to_speak speak_with with_you you_today today_i i_want want_to to_make make_sure sure_that that_we we_get get_your your_consent consent_to to_record record_our our_conversation conversation_.
 so_how how_do do_you you_feel feel_about about_it it_being being_recorded recorded_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_okay okay_with with_you you_okay okay_.
 what_brings brings_you you_in in_to to_clinic clinic_today today_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_naomi naomi_was was_telling telling_me me_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_recovering recovering_from from_surgery surgery_.
 goodness_.
 wow_.
 is_there there_an an_explanation explanation_as as_to to_the the_cause cause_of of_it it_.
 mm_.
 okay_.
 yeah_how how_would would_you you_feel feel_about about_talking talking_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_about about_your your_i i_v v_drug drug_use use_.
 okay_kinda kinda_let let_you you_start start_.
 and_tell tell_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_your your_experience experience_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_why why_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_here here_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_here here_to to_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_is is_this this_your your_first first_time time_experiencing experiencing_some some_medical medical_complications complications_from from_your your_use use_.
 going_on on_.
 this_is is_kind kind_of of_the the_final final_straw straw_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 yeah_any any_benefits benefits_to to_using using_anymore anymore_.
 how_is is_that that_a a_benefit benefit_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 no_.
 benefit_anymore anymore_.
 and_what what_in in_your your_mind mind_are are_the the_benefits benefits_to to_changing changing_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_so so_either either_cutting cutting_back back_or or_.
 or_quitting quitting_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_the the_only only_option option_is is_to to_quit quit_and and_quit quit_once once_and and_for for_all all_and and_be be_done done_with with_it it_or or_else else_or or_else else_i i_mean mean_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_no no_other other_no no_other other_avenue avenue_from from_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_right right_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_maybe maybe_made made_some some_attempts attempts_in in_the the_past past_to to_get get_clean clean_you you_mentioned mentioned_that that_you you_.
 did_you you_go go_to to_treatment treatment_or or_.
 yeah_are are_there there_any any_differences differences_between between_then then_and and_now now_.
 and_what what_are are_those those_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_now now_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_for for_your your_own own_personal personal_.
 yeah_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_for for_you you_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_for for_your your_livelihood livelihood_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_for for_your your_well-being well-being_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_also also_for for_your your_health health_because because_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_pretty pretty_compromised compromised_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_what what_is is_it it_going going_to to_take take_.
 don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_fair fair_oftentimes oftentimes_we we_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_.
 naomi_was was_telling telling_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_and and_i i_was was_reading reading_here here_when when_i i_came came_in in_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_using using_methodone methodone_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_prescribed prescribed_methodone methodone_for for_pain pain_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 are_you you_getting getting_any any_other other_benefit benefit_from from_that that_as as_far far_as as_.
 yeah_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_i i_imagine imagine_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_quite quite_difficult difficult_.
 kind_of of_that that_idea idea_of of_going going_out out_and and_seeking seeking_or or_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_maybe maybe_one one_of of_the the_biggest biggest_barriers barriers_is is_breaking breaking_free free_from from_that that_social social_group group_.
 and_those those_phone phone_calls calls_and and_those those_friends friends_and and_.
 yeah_.
 fantastic_.
 mm-hmm_yeah yeah_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_change change_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_big big_change change_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_definitely definitely_have have_the the_support support_behind behind_you you_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_a a_matter matter_of of_making making_the the_commitment commitment_.
 well_what what_i i_can can_share share_with with_you you_today today_if if_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_like like_is is_the the_results results_of of_our our_study study_and and_some some_of of_the the_paperwork paperwork_that that_you you_filled filled_out out_.
 what_were were_your your_thoughts thoughts_.
 before_we we_jump jump_into into_that that_.
 when_you you_were were_completing completing_everything everything_what what_were were_you you_feeling feeling_.
 what_were were_you you_thinking thinking_.
 okay_.
 okay_understandable understandable_.
 so_what what_we we_do do_is is_based based_on on_your your_responses responses_from from_the the_study study_we we_come come_up up_with with_a a_score score_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_called called_a a_dast dast_score score_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_drug drug_abuse abuse_screening screening_test test_score score_.
 and_we we_think think_of of_this this_scale scale_as as_like like_a a_richter richter_scale scale_so so_the the_disparity disparity_is is_pretty pretty_high high_between between_no no_risk risk_to to_severe severe_risk risk_.
 and_let let_me me_share share_real real_quick quick_if if_you you_would would_like like_where where_your your_score score_fell fell_.
 based_on on_what what_you you_endorsed endorsed_you you_were were_in in_the the_high high_severe severe_risk risk_category category_or or_high high_danger danger_to to_drug drug_use use_.
 and_so so_what what_this this_means means_is is_that that_you you_may may_have have_medical medical_injuries injuries_you you_may may_have have_mental mental_or or_emotional emotional_consequences consequences_from from_your your_use use_.
 and_these these_are are_things things_that that_we we_&apos;ve &apos;ve_already already_talked talked_about about_.
 and_so so_oftentimes oftentimes_what what_we we_look look_for for_what what_we we_advise advise_folks folks_in in_these these_categories categories_to to_do do_is is_to to_cut cut_back back_in in_some some_way way_like like_we we_&apos;ve &apos;ve_already already_talked talked_about about_.
 or_kind kind_of of_look look_at at_their their_use use_and and_how how_they they_can can_change change_it it_quitting quitting_or or_even even_staying staying_the the_same same_if if_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_that that_they they_prefer prefer_to to_do do_.
 looking_at at_this this_does does_this this_change change_anything anything_.
 yeah_.
 it_just just_reinforces reinforces_your your_feelings feelings_.
 okay_well well_we we_have have_a a_couple couple_options options_that that_i i_can can_offer offer_you you_from from_at at_least least_my my_standpoint standpoint_.
 and_one one_it it_sounds sounds_like like_the the_methodone methodone_is is_like like_you you_mentioned mentioned_helpful helpful_with with_kind kind_of of_curbing curbing_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 excellent_.
 okay_so so_you you_already already_have have_that that_in in_the the_works works_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 great_.
 i_do do_have have_a a_list list_of of_resources resources_for for_treatment treatment_too too_.
 is_that that_something something_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_interested interested_in in_.
 okay_so so_harborview harborview_actually actually_offers offers_a a_fantastic fantastic_program program_addictions addictions_program program_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_interested interested_in in_coming coming_.
 to_harborview harborview_.
 mm-hmm_.

 you_&apos;re &apos;re_welcome welcome_.
 all_right right_so so_as as_i i_mentioned mentioned_this this_is is_just just_gonna gonna_be be_a a_really really_brief brief_conversation conversation_about about_one one_of of_the the_measures measures_you you_filled filled_out out_.
 and_then then_also also_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_drug drug_use use_and and_whether whether_or or_not not_you you_feel feel_like like_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_impacting impacting_your your_life life_at at_all all_so so_.
 so_do do_you you_have have_any any_questions questions_for for_me me_before before_we we_get get_started started_or or_.
 okay_and and_how how_was was_it it_kind kind_of of_filling filling_out out_the the_interviews interviews_yesterday yesterday_.
 didn_&apos;t &apos;t_take take_too too_long long_.
 okay_great great_well well_one one_of of_the the_many many_papers papers_that that_you you_filled filled_out out_was was_called called_the the_d d_a a_s s_which which_is is_a a_drug drug_abuse abuse_screening screening_test test_.
 and_would would_it it_be be_okay okay_with with_you you_if if_i i_go go_over over_the the_results results_with with_you you_really really_quickly quickly_.
 okay_so so_we we_have have_this this_handy handy_little little_visual visual_right right_here here_.
 so_basically basically_all all_of of_the the_scores scores_are are_on on_a a_zero zero_to to_ten ten_scale scale_.
 and_it it_looks looks_like like_according according_to to_this this_that that_you you_actually actually_scored scored_a a_nine nine_.
 which_would would_be be_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_on on_the the_severe severe_risk risk_scale scale_.
 so_how how_do do_you you_feel feel_about about_that that_.
 what_do do_you you_think think_.
 okay_.
 okay_could could_you you_tell tell_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_about about_that that_.
 severe_risk risk_could could_be be_anything anything_it it_could could_be be_health health_problems problems_.
 it_could could_be be_something something_like like_drinking drinking_and and_driving driving_.
 i_mean mean_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_severe severe_risk risk_to to_your your_health health_or or_to to_your your_person person_so so_.
 okay_.

 okay_so so_yeah yeah_can can_you you_tell tell_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_about about_sorta sorta_your your_reaction reaction_to to_looking looking_at at_this this_and and_what what_you you_think think_.

 mm-hmm_.
 hm_.
 mm-hmm_so so_whereas whereas_once once_before before_it it_was was_more more_fun fun_and and_recreational recreational_now now_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_having having_a a_hard hard_time time_knowing knowing_any any_other other_way way_to to_sort sort_of of_.
 yeah_.
 okay_well well_so so_you you_had had_mentioned mentioned_quitting quitting_heroine heroine_.
 have_you you_ever ever_tried tried_to to_quit quit_coke coke_before before_.
 mm-hmm_.
 do_you you_have have_a a_lot lot_of of_friends friends_or or_a a_lot lot_of of_people people_that that_you you_know know_that that_use use_pretty pretty_heavily heavily_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_also also_kind kind_of of_being being_in in_that that_environment environment_of of_pretty pretty_heavy heavy_using using_as as_well well_might might_make make_it it_difficult difficult_.
 and_so so_even even_though though_i i_mean mean_you you_had had_said said_that that_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_using using_heroine heroine_for for_too too_long long_.
 i_mean mean_i i_still still_think think_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_awesome awesome_that that_you you_were were_able able_to to_quit quit_.
 were_there there_some some_what what_were were_some some_of of_the the_things things_that that_you you_were were_able able_to to_do do_to to_help help_you you_quit quit_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_much much_out out_of of_your your_system system_for for_good good_the the_real real_craving craving_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_so so_are are_you you_currently currently_working working_right right_now now_.
 or_you you_had had_said said_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_a a_respite respite_home home_.
 okay_.
 for_the the_past past_three three_days days_.
 okay_.
 prior_to to_that that_were were_you you_working working_or or_.
 okay_.
 oh_.
 okay_.
 hm_.
 yeah_depression depression_can can_be be_really really_difficult difficult_.
 so_you you_had had_mentioned mentioned_obviously obviously_that that_you you_feel feel_like like_there there_really really_isn isn_&apos;t &apos;t_anything anything_good good_about about_or or_any any_benefits benefits_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_seen seen_in in_your your_life life_from from_drug drug_use use_you you_had had_mentioned mentioned_.
 hm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_when when_you you_say say_take take_a a_hit hit_do do_you you_mean mean_cocaine cocaine_or or_marijuana marijuana_.
 cocaine_.
 crack_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_and and_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_it it_sounds sounds_like like_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_is is_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_seen seen_the the_cost cost_to to_your your_health health_and and_obviously obviously_the the_financial financial_aspect aspect_you you_had had_mentioned mentioned_really really_briefly briefly_and and_even even_though though_there there_is is_that that_benefit benefit_of of_it it_sort sort_of of_in in_the the_moment moment_feeling feeling_a a_little little_bit bit_better better_that that_the the_long-term long-term_consequences consequences_sort sort_of of_outweigh outweigh_that that_much much_more more_.
 so_at at_this this_point point_if if_you you_had had_to to_put put_it it_on on_like like_a a_one one_to to_ten ten_scale scale_how how_important important_would would_it it_be be_for for_you you_right right_now now_do do_you you_think think_to to_.
 yeah_.
 yes_.
 i_should should_have have_told told_you you_that that_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_great great_.
 how_has has_it it_felt felt_for for_the the_past past_three three_days days_being being_clean clean_so so_far far_.
 mm-hmm_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_awesome awesome_.
 and_have have_you you_talked talked_to to_them them_at at_the the_respite respite_center center_about about_when when_you you_leave leave_kinda kinda_seeing seeing_about about_treatment treatment_options options_or or_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 hm_.
 mm-hmm_it it_makes makes_a a_lot lot_of of_sense sense_because because_it it_sounds sounds_like like_maybe maybe_getting getting_your your_health health_back back_first first_and and_then then_being being_able able_to to_check check_in in_with with_them them_and and_.
 so_similar similar_question question_on on_a a_one one_to to_ten ten_scale scale_if if_you you_had had_to to_rate rate_how how_confident confident_you you_are are_right right_now now_about about_being being_able able_to to_quit quit_what what_number number_would would_you you_give give_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_well well_i i_mean mean_that that_shows shows_the the_a a_huge huge_level level_of of_self-awareness self-awareness_and and_self-restraint self-restraint_.
 i_mean mean_to to_be be_able able_to to_do do_that that_and and_to to_to to_recognize recognize_what what_some some_triggers triggers_might might_be be_and and_be be_able able_to to_kind kind_of of_stop stop_the the_triggers triggers_in in_the the_tracks tracks_on on_your your_own own_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kind kind_of of_on on_that that_cusp cusp_right right_now now_of of_about about_a a_five five_.
 and_what what_do do_you you_think think_it it_would would_take take_for for_you you_to to_give give_it it_a a_little little_bit bit_higher higher_of of_a a_number number_.

 mm-hmm_.
 so_the the_longer longer_that that_you you_go go_without without_having having_it it_in in_your your_system system_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_noticing noticing_more more_clarity clarity_.
 okay_and and_how how_long long_are are_you you_gonna gonna_be be_at at_the the_respite respite_center center_for for_.
 oh_.
 hm_.
 hm_.
 and_you you_said said_this this_is is_related related_to to_your your_diabetes diabetes_.
 hm_.
 and_have have_you you_had had_any any_problems problems_similar similar_to to_this this_before before_in in_the the_past past_or or_is is_this this_.
 okay_and and_you you_had had_mentioned mentioned_before before_that that_you you_think think_there there_might might_be be_also also_something something_related related_to to_drug drug_use use_and and_affecting affecting_that that_as as_well well_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 all_right right_well well_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_have have_a a_lot lot_of of_clarity clarity_a a_lot lot_of of_self-awareness self-awareness_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_recognize recognize_that that_the the_short-term short-term_consequences consequences_ultimately ultimately_or or_the the_short-term short-term_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_the the_pleasure pleasure_short-term short-term_of of_using using_ultimately ultimately_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_necessarily necessarily_have have_the the_benefits benefits_of of_the the_long-term long-term_consequences consequences_.
 and_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_a a_place place_right right_now now_where where_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_kind kind_of of_stay stay_away away_from from_it it_sounds sounds_like like_maybe maybe_potential potential_triggers triggers_.
 and_getting getting_healthy healthy_which which_is is_great great_.
 and_again again_i i_mean mean_i i_think think_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_impressive impressive_that that_you you_were were_able able_to to_quit quit_heroine heroine_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_impressive impressive_that that_you you_had had_the the_wherewithal wherewithal_today today_to to_know know_that that_you you_had had_a a_little little_money money_in in_your your_pocket pocket_and and_to to_kind kind_of of_stop stop_yourself yourself_.
 so_well well_did did_you you_have have_any any_other other_questions questions_for for_me me_or or_.
 okay_i i_mean mean_this this_is is_pretty pretty_much much_all all_it it_is is_is is_just just_kind kind_of of_a a_conversation conversation_so so_.
 would_it it_be be_okay okay_with with_you you_if if_i i_follow follow_up up_in in_a a_week week_&apos;s &apos;s_time time_and and_give give_you you_a a_call call_and and_just just_kinda kinda_check check_in in_and and_see see_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_.
 and_see see_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_about about_the the_conversation conversation_if if_anything anything_at at_all all_.

 so_do do_you you_currently currently_use use_methamphetamines methamphetamines_.
 yeah_.
 because_of of_money money_.
 so_you you_would would_if if_you you_had had_the the_money money_.
 and_.
 so_you you_.
 when_you you_can can_afford afford_it it_you you_use use_meth meth_.
 okay_.
 and_it it_really really_you you_find find_it it_that that_it it_increases increases_the the_pleasure pleasure_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_known known_people people_who who_you you_feel feel_like like_have have_used used_methamphetamines methamphetamines_used used_meth meth_and and_have have_gotten gotten_in in_trouble trouble_with with_it it_.
 yeah_you you_really really_enjoy enjoy_the the_sexual sexual_pleasure pleasure_that that_you you_get get_when when_using using_meth meth_.
 is_there there_something something_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_about about_it it_.
 or_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_bad bad_about about_it it_if if_anything anything_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_.
 had_some some_teeth teeth_that that_have have_decayed decayed_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_so so_what what_is is_sex sex_like like_without without_methamphetamines methamphetamines_.
 so_even even_without without_.
 use_you you_feel feel_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_some some_of of_the the_effects effects_that that_you you_had had_before before_.
 wow_.
 right_.
 well_there there_are are_some some_pretty pretty_serious serious_pleasurable pleasurable_side side_effects effects_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_rotting rotting_your your_teeth teeth_away away_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_because because_of of_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_decreased decreased_your your_use use_.
 is_that that_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_these these_sort sort_of of_two two_things things_here here_where where_you you_like like_the the_effects effects_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_some some_of of_the the_effects effects_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_oral oral_.
 kind_of of_what what_do do_you you_with with_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 there_are are_health health_side side_effects effects_to to_these these_drugs drugs_yeah yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_you you_stop stop_taking taking_.
 care_of of_yourself yourself_so so_even even_your your_teeth teeth_are are_falling falling_out out_and and_.
 yeah_.
 mm_.
 yeah_and and_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_well well_into into_if if_you you_break break_the the_law law_suffer suffer_the the_consequences consequences_.
 right_.
 you_you you_know know_that that_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_in in_some some_respects respects_it it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_sound sound_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_worth worth_the the_tradeoff tradeoff_the the_pleasure pleasure_you you_get get_versus versus_the the_consequences consequences_.
 is_it it_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 you_have have_higher higher_ambitions ambitions_than than_that that_.
 so_what what_do do_you you_think think_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_do do_in in_terms terms_of of_the the_meth meth_use use_.
 knowing_the the_tradeoff tradeoff_between between_the the_increase increase_in in_pleasure pleasure_and and_then then_the the_health health_consequences consequences_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_hard hard_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 but_you you_know know_what what_but but_.
 so_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_yeah yeah_.
 just_financially financially_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_more more_financial financial_than than_you you_actually actually_wanting wanting_to to_quit quit_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_that that_sort sort_of of_sounds sounds_like like_a a_plan plan_to to_stop stop_using using_methamphetamines methamphetamines_.
 yeah_.
 uh-huh_.
 right_.
 who_.
 are_these these_people people_are are_these these_people people_.
 that_are are_using using_drugs drugs_or or_.
 these_are are_coworkers coworkers_.
 of_yours yours_.
 yeah_.
 uh-huh_.
 uh-huh_.
 and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_because because_of of_their their_drug drug_use use_.
 oh_.
 drug_use use_.
 drug_use use_can can_arrest arrest_your your_development development_.
 yeah_.
 wow_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_destructive destructive_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_potential potential_for for_pretty pretty_serious serious_emotional emotional_and and_physical physical_issues issues_.
 over_a a_long long_period period_of of_time time_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 well_so so_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_that that_we we_this this_i i_think think_we we_can can_be be_done done_with with_this this_.
 i_got got_the the_impression impression_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_seen seen_some some_pretty pretty_negative negative_effects effects_of of_drug drug_use use_from from_a a_number number_of of_different different_drugs drugs_and and_that that_your your_use use_your your_methamphetamine methamphetamine_use use_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_well well_on on_the the_one one_hand hand_it it_does does_have have_some some_positive positive_side side_effects effects_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_it it_has has_costs costs_problem problem_with with_your your_teeth teeth_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_expensive expensive_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_afford afford_it it_.
 and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_seen seen_some some_people people_have have_some some_lifelong lifelong_problems problems_yeah yeah_due due_to to_.
 and_i i_got got_the the_impression impression_that that_you you_are are_planning planning_because because_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_afford afford_it it_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_be be_kind kind_of of_the the_way way_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_gonna gonna_use use_and and_that that_may may_have have_some some_health health_benefits benefits_for for_you you_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kind kind_of of_reducing reducing_your your_risk risk_your your_health health_risk risk_by by_choosing choosing_a a_particular particular_kind kind_of of_drug drug_.
 yeah_.
 mm_.
 yeah_.

 ooh_.
 yeah_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_serious serious_health health_risk risk_.
 yeah_.
 so_the the_last last_thing thing_that that_i i_wanted wanted_to to_show show_you you_.
 is_you you_did did_a a_number number_of of_different different_kind kind_of of_questionnaires questionnaires_with with_lea lea_.
 and_your your_answers answers_to to_these these_questionnaire questionnaire_kind kind_of of_you you_fall fall_into into_this this_scale scale_of of_a a_level level_of of_risk risk_that that_you you_may may_be be_associated associated_that that_your your_drug drug_use use_may may_be be_associated associated_with with_.
 and_when when_we we_say say_risk risk_we we_mean mean_dangers dangers_that that_you you_may may_experience experience_in in_mental mental_health health_emotional emotional_medical medical_financial financial_whatever whatever_.
 and_this this_questionnaire questionnaire_is is_given given_to to_a a_whole whole_bunch bunch_of of_people people_.
 and_so so_the the_level level_of of_risk risk_is is_scaled scaled_from from_no no_risk risk_at at_zero zero_to to_ten ten_being being_most most_severe severe_risk risk_.
 of_harm harm_or or_of of_danger danger_.
 yeah_across across_your your_life life_across across_your your_your your_medical medical_your your_risk risk_of of_medical medical_problems problems_your your_risk risk_of of_having having_some some_kind kind_of of_physical physical_injury injury_your your_risk risk_of of_problems problems_with with_your your_emotions emotions_or or_with with_your your_mental mental_status status_risk risk_of of_financial financial_problems problems_legal legal_problems problems_.
 well_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_kind kind_of of_asked asked_to to_ask ask_you you_.
 where_do do_you you_think think_you you_fall fall_on on_this this_scale scale_within within_sort sort_of of_this this_pyramid pyramid_here here_in in_terms terms_of of_your your_risk risk_and and_your your_drug drug_use use_.
 currently_your your_current current_drug drug_use use_and and_where where_you you_might might_fall fall_in in_there there_.
 right_.
 okay_.
 all_right right_the the_way way_you you_scored scored_just just_from from_this this_questionnaire questionnaire_put put_you you_at at_a a_three three_which which_is is_moderate moderate_risk risk_.
 and_then then_as as_you you_noticed noticed_yeah yeah_it it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_kinda kinda_go go_up up_geometrically geometrically_here here_.
 so_what what_do do_you you_think think_of of_that that_.

 and_tell tell_me me_more more_why why_weekends weekends_and and_why why_not not_other other_times times_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_your your_way way_to to_kinda kinda_keep keep_it it_safe safe_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_confused confused_.
 what_would would_become become_the the_medical medical_issue issue_.
 oh_.
 uh-huh_but but_you you_feel feel_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_kind kind_of of_figured figured_out out_a a_way way_to to_take take_care care_of of_it it_with with_kind kind_of of_side side_skirting skirting_the the_medical medical_yeah yeah_.
 tell_me me_why why_have have_you you_done done_that that_versus versus_talk talk_to to_your your_doctor doctor_about about_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_available available_for for_you you_particularly particularly_.

 uh-huh_.
 right_okay okay_.
 okay_.
 but_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_kicked kicked_that that_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 yeah_so so_tell tell_me me_how how_.
 i_mean mean_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_cool cool_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_able able_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_kinda kinda_on on_that that_edge edge_a a_little little_bit bit_you you_can can_see see_that that_but but_.
 well_you you_have have_to to_have have_been been_a a_very very_strong strong_person person_to to_have have_kicked kicked_the the_alcohol alcohol_drug drug_stuff stuff_.
 uh-huh_.
 right_.
 right_so so_your your_thought thought_is is_doing doing_it it_on on_the the_weekend weekend_and and_not not_.
 once_.
 once_a a_week week_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_gonna gonna_get get_you you_addicted addicted_but but_it it_provides provides_some some_relief relief_for for_your your_.
 yeah_.
 but_during during_the the_week week_your your_pain pain_and and_.
 you_just just_you you_have have_to to_sort sort_of of_charge charge_through through_it it_yeah yeah_because because_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_job job_and and_.
 what_kinda kinda_work work_do do_you you_do do_.
 okay_.
 okay_okay okay_.
 kinda_all all_the the_time time_you you_see see_it it_from from_all all_the the_angles angles_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_it it_is is_interesting interesting_because because_i i_mean mean_you you_said said_a a_couple couple_things things_when when_you you_said said_sort sort_of of_the the_ultimate ultimate_irony irony_and and_also also_kind kind_of of_realizing realizing_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_on on_that that_little little_tight tight_rope rope_.
 the_thing thing_and and_i i_studied studied_to to_become become_a a_chemical chemical_dependency dependency_counselor counselor_and and_i i_worked worked_as as_one one_for for_a a_while while_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 right_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_good good_point point_.
 so_for for_you you_you you_kind kind_of of_weigh weigh_it it_that that_way way_how how_is is_it it_helping helping_is is_it it_interfering interfering_with with_my my_life life_.
 mm-hmm_.
 wow_so so_throughout throughout_the the_week week_your your_jaw jaw_is is_just just_getting getting_more more_and and_more more_tense tense_.
 uh-huh_just just_takes takes_some some_of of_that that_edge edge_off off_.
 right_.
 uh-huh_.

 so_it it_seems seems_like like_i i_can can_see see_where where_the the_benefits benefits_are are_.
 you_definitely definitely_are are_getting getting_first first_of of_all all_it it_seems seems_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_figuring figuring_out out_a a_way way_to to_kinda kinda_manage manage_the the_drug drug_use use_in in_terms terms_of of_kinda kinda_safety safety_you you_know know_you you_have have_a a_job job_to to_do do_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_.
 right_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_interfering interfering_with with_your your_job job_because because_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_doing doing_it it_during during_the the_week week_it it_gives gives_you you_a a_space space_to to_kind kind_of of_relax relax_your your_whole whole_body body_get get_kinda kinda_calm calm_on on_the the_weekend weekend_.
 yeah_it it_kind kind_of of_takes takes_that that_edge edge_off off_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_doing doing_it it_while while_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_driving driving_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_figuring figuring_out out_a a_good good_safe safe_place place_to to_do do_it it_.
 so_all all_that that_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_from from_you you_feels feels_like like_you you_kinda kinda_have have_figured figured_out out_a a_lot lot_of of_stuff stuff_but but_i i_also also_heard heard_you you_say say_sort sort_of of_knowing knowing_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_had had_sort sort_of of_a a_history history_of of_drug drug_and and_alcohol alcohol_stuff stuff_you you_also also_realize realize_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_on on_that that_tightrope tightrope_.
 what_would would_it it_look look_like like_for for_you you_to to_drop drop_off off_the the_tightrope tightrope_in in_terms terms_of of_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_maybe maybe_you you_.
 okay_.
 right_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_.
 i_mean mean_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_.
 okay_uh-huh uh-huh_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_have have_to to_have have_a a_better better_source source_.
 than_she she_needs needs_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_the the_.
 uh-huh_.
 she_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_need need_very very_much much_.
 right_.
 right_.
 i_can can_kinda kinda_speculate speculate_how how_you you_might might_answer answer_this this_but but_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_gonna gonna_ask ask_you you_.
 again_why why_haven haven_&apos;t &apos;t_you you_asked asked_your your_doctor doctor_if if_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_some some_kind kind_of of_.
 uh-huh_.
 oh_they they_do do_.
 they_do do_know know_that that_you you_.
 uh-huh_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_really really_up up_front front_with with_your your_doctors doctors_about about_yeah yeah_and and_they they_know know_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_it it_and and_that that_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_helping helping_.
 and_are are_they they_saying saying_this this_might might_not not_be be_useful useful_to to_you you_or or_how how_.
 they_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_give give_you you_feedback feedback_at at_all all_huh huh_.
 huh_interesting interesting_i i_mean mean_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_a a_doctor doctor_so so_but but_it it_is is_interesting interesting_.
 interesting_.
 yeah_.
 huh_i i_mean mean_i i_would would_be be_kind kind_of of_curious curious_to to_ask ask_them them_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_what what_they they_think think_.
 oh_okay okay_.
 right_right right_.
 right_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_built built_up up_this this_kinda kinda_comfortable comfortable_rapport rapport_and and_.
 right_right right_.
 right_but but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_very very_open open_with with_them them_about about_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_dealing dealing_with with_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_so so_kind kind_of of_.
 uh-huh_so so_now now_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_treating treating_it it_with with_prescription prescription_pain pain_relievers relievers_but but_.
 uh-huh_even even_while while_you you_were were_doing doing_the the_other other_uh-huh uh-huh_and and_this this_seems seems_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_helped helped_you you_the the_most most_.
 mm-hmm_so so_in in_addition addition_to to_what what_else else_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_given given_.
 uh-huh_like like_ibuprofen ibuprofen_kind kind_of of_thing thing_or or_.
 uh-huh_but but_high high_dose dose_.
 mm-hmm_.
 kinda_on on_a a_scale scale_of of_zero zero_to to_ten ten_how how_much much_do do_you you_think think_or or_how how_worried worried_are are_you you_about about_the the_level level_of of_drug drug_use use_that that_you you_have have_now now_.
 doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_sound sound_like like_it it_yeah yeah_.
 so_zero zero_.
 mm-hmm_and and_what what_.
 yeah_one one_to to_ten ten_.
 okay_why why_a a_two two_versus versus_a a_one one_.
 mm-hmm_because because_of of_your your_history history_.
 uh-huh_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 because_your your_girlfriend girlfriend_has has_it it_.
 and_i i_mean mean_i i_can can_speculate speculate_if if_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_your your_own own_supply supply_it it_might might_be be_a a_larger larger_supply supply_and and_maybe maybe_more more_accessible accessible_to to_you you_.
 mm-hmm_so so_is is_it it_possible possible_that that_doing doing_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_now now_feels feels_safer safer_to to_you you_.
 more_than than_a a_small small_dose dose_small small_.
 uh-huh_.
 right_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_pretty pretty_good good_handle handle_on on_what what_works works_for for_you you_but but_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_interesting interesting_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_some some_kind kind_of of_barrier barrier_that that_keeps keeps_you you_from from_making making_it it_kind kind_of of_legitimate legitimate_your your_own own_prescription prescription_.
 yeah_i i_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_put put_it it_.
 yeah_i i_mean mean_obviously obviously_nobody nobody_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_had had_a a_talk talk_with with_you you_and and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_very very_open open_about about_what what_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_doing doing_.
 and_i i_mean mean_i i_think think_the the_benefit benefit_to to_having having_it it_prescribed prescribed_to to_you you_and and_then then_being being_able able_to to_monitor monitor_.
 yeah_.
 ahh_right right_so so_sort sort_of of_just just_the the_legality legality_of of_it it_would would_be be_a a_big big_benefit benefit_yeah yeah_.
 well_and and_i i_think think_the the_other other_benefit benefit_and and_again again_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_a a_doctor doctor_but but_i i_speculate speculate_that that_one one_benefit benefit_would would_be be_they they_could could_monitor monitor_how how_is is_this this_particular particular_drug drug_working working_for for_you you_and and_are are_there there_potential potential_side side_effects effects_or or_whatever whatever_.
 yeah_and and_it it_kind kind_of of_opens opens_the the_door door_for for_you you_to to_be be_.
 i_mean mean_you you_seem seem_like like_a a_very very_open open_person person_.
 but_it it_opens opens_the the_door door_to to_have have_even even_more more_of of_that that_communication communication_.
 yeah_does does_it it_sound sound_.
 yeah_i i_mean mean_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_to to_put put_words words_in in_your your_mouth mouth_but but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_are are_already already_talking talking_with with_them them_about about_it it_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_kinda kinda_.
 yeah_have have_you you_thought thought_about about_taking taking_that that_step step_to to_.
 uh-huh_did did_they they_tell tell_you you_why why_.
 okay_.
 uh-huh_okay okay_and and_is is_it it_.
 and_then then_what what_they they_have have_used used_in in_the the_past past_has has_have have_you you_tried tried_that that_and and_it it_hasn hasn_&apos;t &apos;t_worked worked_for for_you you_.
 okay_okay okay_.
 uh-huh_in in_the the_same same_way way_.
 right_so so_any any_concerns concerns_about about_your your_kidneys kidneys_and and_liver liver_with with_the the_.
 uh-huh_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_small small_enough enough_.
 sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_your your_kind kind_of of_background background_work work_too too_.
 right_right right_how how_much much_are are_you you_taking taking_.
 uh-huh_vicodin vicodin_or or_.
 mm-hmm_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_i i_mean mean_one one_of of_the the_benefits benefits_to to_talking talking_about about_your your_doctor doctor_and and_if if_the the_doctor doctor_agrees agrees_yeah yeah_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_try try_this this_plan plan_would would_be be_the the_legality legality_for for_you you_and and_for for_your your_girlfriend girlfriend_.
 but_yeah yeah_.
 i_mean mean_she she_risks risks_something something_by by_offering offering_her her_own own_drugs drugs_to to_you you_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_i i_mean mean_you you_know know_the the_system system_well well_given given_that that_you you_work work_within within_that that_system system_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_well well_versed versed_yeah yeah_.
 i_wanted wanted_to to_give give_you you_i i_know know_you you_filled filled_out out_a a_bunch bunch_of of_these these_forms forms_out out_there there_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_at at_this this_point point_that that_your your_only only_drug drug_is is_doing doing_this this_on on_the the_weekend weekend_no no_other other_alcohol alcohol_or or_.
 yeah_you you_were were_able able_to to_get get_beyond beyond_that that_.
 yeah_how how_long long_ago ago_did did_you you_stop stop_.
 wow_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_a a_while while_.
 okay_.
 so_are are_.
 okay_so so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_those those_meds meds_too too_to to_sort sort_of of_.
 yeah_i i_mean mean_just just_hearing hearing_that that_too too_i i_think think_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_useful useful_for for_a a_doctor doctor_to to_be be_able able_to to_see see_okay okay_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_interaction interaction_between between_these these_things things_.
 right_maybe maybe_having having_more more_of of_a a_conversation conversation_about about_it it_to to_just just_say say_hey hey_can can_we we_what what_do do_you you_think think_of of_prescribing prescribing_this this_it it_seems seems_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_helping helping_me me_.
 yeah_but but_also also_your your_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_also also_know know_yourself yourself_well well_enough enough_to to_know know_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_give give_me me_a a_big big_huge huge_bottle bottle_of of_high high_dose dose_.
 yeah_you you_can can_do do_it it_little little_bit bit_at at_a a_time time_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_fine fine_.
 yeah_tell tell_me me_what what_other other_fears fears_you you_have have_about about_it it_.
 uh-huh_.
 right_what what_keeps keeps_you you_from from_doing doing_it it_every every_day day_.
 uh-huh_does does_your your_girlfriend girlfriend_provide provide_some some_kind kind_of of_support support_or or_.
 uh-huh_so so_she she_&apos;s &apos;s_surprised surprised_at at_how how_much much_you you_could could_take take_compared compared_to to_her her_.
 wow_and and_have have_you you_done done_that that_at at_times times_.
 how_often often_does does_that that_happen happen_.
 yeah_so so_what what_is is_ten ten_times times_what what_she she_can can_take take_.
 uh-huh_.
 so_.
 generally_.
 uh-huh_how how_often often_do do_you you_think think_that that_you you_do do_that that_.
 what_gets gets_you you_to to_that that_point point_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 right_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_all all_tense tense_.
 right_.
 what_do do_you you_think think_gets gets_your your_.
 do_you you_find find_yourself yourself_getting getting_more more_and and_more more_that that_way way_as as_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_all all_this this_kinda kinda_connected connected_pain pain_basically basically_.
 mm-hmm_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_that that_like like_what what_i i_can can_imagine imagine_another another_would would_be be_that that_one one_week week_ten ten_milligrams milligrams_isn isn_&apos;t &apos;t_working working_so so_the the_next next_week week_you you_do do_two two_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_that that_kind kind_of of_thing thing_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_more more_that that_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_more more_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_happening happening_and and_around around_your your_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 i_would would_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_worth worth_having having_that that_conversation conversation_with with_your your_doctor doctor_.
 and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_open open_with with_them them_about about_what what_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_tried tried_and and_you you_know know_kind kind_of of_what what_works works_.
 ask_them them_what what_the the_pros pros_and and_cons cons_of of_it it_is is_.
 tell_them them_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_that that_.
 you_have have_a a_choice choice_.
 yeah_i i_mean mean_you you_have have_kind kind_of of_taken taken_things things_in in_your your_control control_and and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_pretty pretty_good good_sense sense_of of_who who_you you_are are_and and_what what_your your_body body_will will_take take_kind kind_of of_what what_your your_tolerance tolerance_for for_drugs drugs_and and_alcohol alcohol_are are_.
 yeah_and and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_good good_sense sense_of of_that that_.
 i_think think_it it_could could_be be_a a_dialogue dialogue_.
 yeah_what what_do do_you you_think think_.
 yeah_how how_likely likely_do do_you you_think think_it it_will will_be be_that that_you you_talk talk_to to_them them_.
 oh_.
 really_.
 oh_.
 wonderful_wonderful wonderful_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_gonna gonna_check check_back back_with with_you you_in in_about about_a a_week week_just just_to to_kind kind_of of_check check_in in_see see_.
 oh_because because_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_somebody somebody_you you_see see_today today_.
 oh_okay okay_.
 okay_.
 hmm_.
 uh-huh_.
 oh_for for_.
 and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_already already_.
 been_seen seen_today today_.
 okay_.
 the_cholesterol cholesterol_is is_.
 right_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_mostly mostly_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_monitoring monitoring_your your_cholesterol cholesterol_.
 yeah_.
 who_do do_you you_see see_for for_the the_jaw jaw_tension tension_.
 see_any any_body body_for for_one one_specific specific_thing thing_or or_kinda kinda_the the_whole whole_person person_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_right right_so so_.
 kind_of of_a a_crap crap_shoot shoot_huh huh_.
 yeah_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_seeing seeing_a a_lot lot_of of_residents residents_coming coming_through through_.
 right_.
 right_right right_.
 sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_good good_attitude attitude_about about_that that_too too_.
 right_right right_.
 yeah_.
 so_the the_next next_time time_you you_see see_somebody somebody_will will_probably probably_be be_three three_or or_four four_months months_down down_the the_road road_.
 you_think think_at at_that that_point point_you you_&apos;ll &apos;ll_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_.
 you_think think_so so_okay okay_.
 good_good good_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_do do_have have_a a_pretty pretty_good good_handle handle_on on_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_good good_insight insight_.
 but_given given_that that_you you_have have_the the_bipolar bipolar_disorder disorder_and and_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_medications medications_taking taking_care care_of of_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_the the_high high_cholesterol cholesterol_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_balancing balancing_all all_that that_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_kinda kinda_good good_to to_.

 yeah_.
 what_happens happens_.
 exactly_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_very very_good good_point point_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_very very_good good_point point_.
 and_.
 and_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_your your_relationship relationship_with with_her her_to to_be be_just just_about about_keeping keeping_you you_in in_the the_drugs drugs_.
 right_.
 exactly_.
 yeah_so so_it it_kinda kinda_could could_clean clean_that that_up up_a a_little little_bit bit_too too_.
 another_option option_would would_be be_to to_think think_about about_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_get get_back back_in in_and and_see see_somebody somebody_sooner sooner_and and_you you_could could_.
 you_can can_wait wait_.
 are_you you_crazy crazy_.
 you_know know_the the_system system_well well_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.

 down_there there_.
 well_i i_guess guess_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_that that_option option_if if_for for_some some_reason reason_things things_do do_flare flare_up up_too too_between between_now now_and and_three three_or or_four four_months months_from from_now now_.
 yeah_.
 seems_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_stable stable_.
 good_and and_how how_about about_the the_bipolar bipolar_stuff stuff_.
 is_that that_pretty pretty_stable stable_too too_.

 oh_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_.
 right_.
 so_then then_it it_would would_be be_back back_in in_the the_same same_cycle cycle_again again_.
 yeah_.
 uh-huh_.
 uh-huh_.
 for_medicare medicare_you you_.
 oh_to to_have have_that that_supplement supplement_.
 uh-huh_.
 uh-huh_.
 oh_.

 it_really really_gives gives_you you_full full_kind kind_of of_safety safety_net net_.
 uh-huh_.
 right_.
 right_cool cool_.
 good_.
 uh-huh_.
 oh_.
 uh-huh_.

 and_you you_get get_nowhere nowhere_.
 oh_well well_.
 because_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_to to_have have_an an_overpayment overpayment_or or_whatever whatever_.

 and_it it_gives gives_you you_a a_rating rating_between between_zero zero_and and_ten ten_in in_terms terms_of of_kind kind_of of_where where_your your_risk risk_level level_is is_.
 and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_kinda kinda_where where_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_landed landed_are are_you you_surprised surprised_at at_that that_.
 or_does does_that that_seem seem_appropriate appropriate_.
 yeah_.

 you_set set_a a_good good_goal goal_of of_not not_going going_down down_that that_road road_you you_know know_your your_limits limits_.
 and_that that_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_go go_down down_there there_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_pretty pretty_dark dark_place place_.

 how_do do_you you_feel feel_about about_using using_cocaine cocaine_as as_a a_sexual sexual_stimulant stimulant_.
 say_that that_again again_the the_.
 oh_okay okay_yeah yeah_.
 okay_.
 so_are are_you you_thinking thinking_the the_cocaine cocaine_is is_something something_that that_makes makes_or or_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_is is_it it_makes makes_it it_more more_pleasurable pleasurable_or or_it it_makes makes_it it_just just_possible possible_.
 okay_.
 and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_tried tried_du du_other other_types types_of of_.
 oh_okay okay_.
 with_your your_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_talked talked_with with_your your_doctor doctor_about about_this this_and and_.
 and_this this_.
 right_and and_he he_said said_that that_well well_i i_mean mean_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_is is_that that_it it_hasn hasn_&apos;t &apos;t_been been_effective effective_so so_you you_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_continuing continuing_to to_use use_cocaine cocaine_.
 right_.
 okay_.
 uh-huh_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 yeah_.
 well_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_go go_with with_what what_works works_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 yeah_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_some some_of of_these these_things things_being being_psychological psychological_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_aware aware_that that_there there_as as_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_older older_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_something something_you you_can can_do do_every every_day day_.
 right_.
 well_so so_tell tell_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_about about_that that_.
 what_concerns concerns_you you_about about_that that_every every_day day_.
 uh-huh_.
 i_see see_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 all_right right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_have have_a a_history history_of of_some some_alcoholism alcoholism_.
 okay_.
 right_.
 so_then then_you you_know know_on on_the the_one one_hand hand_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_are are_some some_positive positive_things things_about about_cocaine cocaine_use use_about about_marijuana marijuana_use use_.
 on_the the_other other_hand hand_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_aware aware_of of_some some_of of_well well_of of_.
 so_what what_can can_you you_tell tell_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_what what_those those_awareness awareness_or or_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_aware aware_of of_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 right_.
 so_as as_far far_as as_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_concerned concerned_marijuana marijuana_is is_really really_not not_very very_harmful harmful_because because_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_.
 okay_.
 right_.
 right_.
 how_about about_.
 other_people people_.
 do_you you_think think_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_different different_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 sure_.
 okay_.
 so_marijuana marijuana_is is_not not_so so_bad bad_but but_the the_cocaine cocaine_is is_a a_bad bad_thing thing_.
 yeah_.
 so_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_if if_you you_when when_it it_would would_it it_be be_a a_bad bad_thing thing_for for_you you_.
 when_would would_you you_know know_like like_oh oh_man man_this this_is is_becoming becoming_bad bad_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_doing doing_that that_.
 but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_.
 aware_that that_there there_may may_be be_a a_risk risk_of of_escalated escalated_use use_at at_some some_point point_.
 is_that that_.
 no_.
 not_for for_you you_okay okay_.
 what_are are_you you_doing doing_to to_.
 control_use use_.
 using_.
 your_head head_.
 right_.
 uh-huh_.
 okay_.
 right_.
 uh-huh_.
 right_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_the the_well well_you you_feel feel_like like_may may_be be_the the_consequences consequences_of of_cocaine cocaine_which which_sounds sounds_like like_you you_know know_what what_the the_consequence consequence_are are_.
 like_lack lack_of of_energy energy_and and_not not_being being_able able_to to_get get_up up_as as_a a_way way_to to_not not_use use_so so_much much_right right_.
 all_right right_.
 okay_.
 right_.
 uh-huh_.

 mm-hmm_.
 right_well well_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_able able_to to_set set_some some_limits limits_on on_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_gonna gonna_use use_and and_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_and and_even even_what what_you you_are are_using using_right right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 how_would would_you you_know know_if if_things things_were were_out out_of of_control control_.
 right_.
 and_then then_.
 it_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_too too_late late_to to_change change_anything anything_.
 okay_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_aware aware_of of_that that_.
 all_right right_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.

 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_had had_some some_pretty pretty_amazing amazing_experiences experiences_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 kinda_a a_culture culture_there there_yeah yeah_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 so_tell tell_me me_why why_is is_.
 yeah_you you_gotta gotta_probably probably_be be_careful careful_huh huh_.
 tell_me me_what what_it it_is is_about about_alcohol alcohol_that that_concerns concerns_you you_more more_than than_these these_other other_two two_.
 uh-huh_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 right_.
 for_appetite appetite_yeah yeah_.
 well_that that_would would_be be_a a_conversation conversation_to to_have have_with with_the the_doctor doctor_perhaps perhaps_yeah yeah_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_.
 yeah_.
 well_that that_i i_appreciate appreciate_your your_being being_so so_open open_.
 yeah_.
 sure_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 so_tell tell_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_what what_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_thought thought_about about_how how_you you_might might_change change_or or_how how_you you_may may_confront confront_this this_problem problem_that that_you you_have have_with with_alcohol alcohol_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_telling telling_me me_about about_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_okay okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 so_what what_does does_that that_make make_you you_think think_about about_treatment treatment_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 so_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_yeah yeah_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_.
 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_a a_lot lot_of of_this this_is is_sorta sorta_based based_on on_your your_own own_kinda kinda_psychological psychological_.
 idea_but but_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_right right_.
 you_learned learned_from from_that that_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.
 so_what what_is is_it it_that that_you you_would would_like like_to to_change change_if if_there there_was was_one one_thing thing_you you_could could_identify identify_.
 mm-hmm_.
 well_i i_guess guess_in in_terms terms_of of_some some_of of_the the_things things_that that_we we_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_talking talking_about about_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 so_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_is is_if if_there there_was was_something something_you you_could could_take take_that that_would would_increase increase_your your_appetite appetite_something something_that that_you you_could could_take take_that that_would would_help help_with with_some some_sexual sexual_stimulation stimulation_right right_.
 there_you you_go go_yeah yeah_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_worth worth_a a_shot shot_huh huh_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 have_you you_tried tried_it it_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_for for_you you_to to_change change_.
 but_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_really really_necessarily necessarily_sure sure_about about_how how_confident confident_you you_are are_about about_changing changing_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 well_i i_appreciate appreciate_you you_taking taking_the the_time time_to to_do do_this this_you you_know know_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 uh-huh_.
 okay_.
 right_.
 sure_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 so_what what_are are_you you_gonna gonna_do do_using using_your your_mind mind_to to_help help_kinda kinda_change change_some some_of of_this this_stuff stuff_.
 how_does does_that that_work work_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 across_the the_street street_okay okay_.
 right_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_things things_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_get get_out out_of of_control control_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_it it_at at_home home_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_in in_your your_own own_space space_right right_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_still still_maybe maybe_feeling feeling_like like_boy boy_it it_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_better better_good good_to to_maybe maybe_drink drink_a a_little little_less less_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_right right_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 right_.

 mm-hmm_.
 when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_home home_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_have have_you you_come come_up up_with with_any any_plans plans_or or_anything anything_that that_you you_can can_think think_of of_that that_would would_help help_you you_try try_to to_maybe maybe_cut cut_down down_some some_on on_the the_alcohol alcohol_.
 right_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 what_do do_you you_think think_would would_be be_helpful helpful_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 so_your your_health health_hasn hasn_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_necessarily necessarily_been been_affected affected_is is_what what_your your_doctor doctor_is is_telling telling_you you_.
 right_.
 all_right right_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_had had_.
 you_know know_that that_at at_some some_point point_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_go go_on on_living living_like like_this this_necessarily necessarily_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 so_is is_this this_something something_new new_that that_you you_started started_thinking thinking_.
 or_is is_this this_something something_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_going going_on on_for for_a a_long long_time time_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_kinda kinda_developed developed_a a_tolerance tolerance_and and_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 right_.
 well_o o_would would_you you_mind mind_if if_i i_give give_you you_a a_maybe maybe_a a_little little_bit bit_of of_feedback feedback_then then_and and_some some_maybe maybe_a a_suggestion suggestion_of of_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_you you_know know_your your_primary primary_doctors doctors_here here_in in_the the_adult adult_medicine medicine_clinic clinic_and and_there there_are are_chemical chemical_dependency dependency_counselors counselors_here here_in in_the the_adult adult_medicine medicine_clinic clinic_.
 and_you you_can can_just just_even even_schedule schedule_an an_appointment appointment_if if_you you_wanna wanna_talk talk_with with_somebody somebody_maybe maybe_about about_what what_you you_might might_do do_or or_what what_some some_options options_are are_.
 i_mean mean_it it_would would_just just_be be_you you_could could_even even_be be_kinda kinda_an an_informal informal_sorta sorta_chat chat_similar similar_you you_know know_.
 okay_and and_you you_can can_just just_make make_that that_appointment appointment_at at_the the_front front_desk desk_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_interested interested_.
 her_name name_is is_.

 there_&apos;s &apos;s_all all_sorts sorts_of of_different different_resources resources_on on_here here_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_interested interested_you you_know know_.
 okay_.
 all_right right_.
 all_right right_and and_if if_you you_have have_any any_questions questions_about about_that that_you you_know know_you you_can can_certainly certainly_talk talk_with with_me me_again again_on on_here here_.
 rosemary_or or_kathleen kathleen_yeah yeah_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 no_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.
 yeah_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_if if_they they_bill bill_or or_not not_for for_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_think think_that that_they they_do do_.
 you_mean mean_there there_&apos;ll &apos;ll_be be_a a_charge charge_for for_i i_think think_just just_coming coming_and and_meeting meeting_with with_somebody somebody_here here_in in_the the_clinic clinic_.
 but_you you_could could_do do_it it_on on_the the_same same_day day_as as_your your_primary primary_care care_doctor doctor_and and_it it_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_be be_anything anything_extra extra_for for_that that_.
 yeah_.

 and_i i_also also_wanna wanna_share share_with with_you you_the the_results results_of of_those those_tests tests_that that_you you_took took_or or_one one_of of_the the_surveys surveys_that that_you you_did did_.
 and_it it_was was_called called_the the_drug drug_abuse abuse_screening screening_test test_.
 and_it it_was was_one one_of of_the the_things things_that that_you you_had had_done done_with with_joey joey_.
 and_it it_rates rates_someone someone_&apos;s &apos;s_risk risk_in in_terms terms_of of_how how_much much_harm harm_they they_may may_be be_in in_depending depending_on on_their their_drug drug_use use_.
 and_the the_risk risk_runs runs_from from_zero zero_as as_no no_risk risk_to to_ten ten_which which_is is_severe severe_risk risk_.
 and_by by_the the_way way_that that_you you_answered answered_your your_questions questions_just just_i i_guess guess_curious curious_as as_to to_what what_you you_think think_your your_risk risk_might might_be be_going going_from from_zero zero_risk risk_to to_ten ten_as as_being being_the the_highest highest_risk risk_the the_risk risk_of of_harm harm_from from_drug drug_use use_.
 yeah_.
 okay_.
 right_.
 so_you you_.
 your_perception perception_of of_marijuana marijuana_is is_pretty pretty_low low_risk risk_of of_harm harm_right right_.
 so_what what_would would_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 so_.
 what_about about_.
 okay_.
 those_two two_things things_would would_be be_sorta sorta_higher higher_risk risk_for for_you you_right right_.
 so_where where_do do_you you_.
 yeah_.
 so_where where_would would_you you_rate rate_yourself yourself_in in_terms terms_of of_what what_you you_feel feel_like like_your your_risk risk_of of_harm harm_is is_from from_alcohol alcohol_and and_cocaine cocaine_.
 yeah_.
 five_okay okay_.
 well_your your_score score_came came_out out_in in_that that_sorta sorta_moderate moderate_risk risk_range range_.
 which_is is_three three_to to_five five_.
 so_you you_were were_your your_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_pretty pretty_good good_perception perception_of of_that that_then then_if if_you you_kinda kinda_trust trust_this this_scale scale_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_rating rating_.
 right_.
 yeah_.
 right_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 sure_oh oh_they they_still still_sell sell_it it_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_legal legal_.
 so_part part_of of_you you_know know_part part_of of_this this_whole whole_conversation conversation_was was_just just_to to_talk talk_with with_you you_about about_what what_you you_feel feel_like like_is is_going going_on on_for for_you you_.

 okay_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_put put_some some_thought thought_into into_changing changing_that that_yeah yeah_in in_a a_way way_that that_you you_could could_go go_about about_it it_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_good good_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_difficult difficult_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_good good_for for_a a_while while_yeah yeah_.

 um-hum_um-hum um-hum_.
 okay_okay okay_.
 okay_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_an an_alcohol alcohol_drinker drinker_much much_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_when when_you you_started started_cocaine cocaine_years years_ago ago_that that_was was_because because_of of_the the_social social_influence influence_.
 okay_.
 yeah_well well_i i_really really_admire admire_your your_ability ability_to to_actually actually_quit quit_after after_.
 so_many many_years years_and and_going going_cold cold_turkey turkey_at at_that that_.
 so_you you_know know_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_having having_a a_lot lot_a a_lot lot_of of_praying praying_a a_lot lot_of of_will will_power power_and and_.
 right_so so_.
 right_but but_you you_managed managed_to to_stay stay_quitting quitting_right right_.
 terrific_.
 sure_.
 yeah_well well_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_great great_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_good good_to to_hear hear_that that_.
 yeah_the the_marijuana marijuana_piece piece_you you_started started_using using_when when_you you_were were_a a_teenager teenager_and and_you you_quit quit_and and_then then_you you_got got_on on_it it_again again_years years_later later_.
 okay_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_recognize recognize_you you_know know_physically physically_and and_you you_think think_about about_it it_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_stop stop_that that_you you_have have_a a_you you_know know_you you_can can_.
 you_have have_a a_choice choice_.
 how_long long_have have_you you_been been_doing doing_the the_weed weed_since since_you you_got got_back back_on on_it it_.
 okay_.
 so_your your_weed weed_use use_has has_increased increased_in in_the the_last last_ten ten_years years_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_decreased decreased_.
 oh_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_sorry sorry_your your_.
 yeah_you you_did did_say say_that that_earlier earlier_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_terrific terrific_i i_mean mean_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_lot lot_of of_work work_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_lot lot_of of_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_lot lot_of of_work work_though though_.
 good_.
 yeah_i i_mean mean_exercise exercise_is is_a a_big big_thing thing_with with_weight weight_loss loss_now now_.
 when_i i_said said_your your_marijuana marijuana_use use_increased increased_.
 when_the the_pain pain_started started_to to_become become_more more_unbearable unbearable_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 well_you you_lost lost_an an_incredible incredible_amount amount_of of_weight weight_.
 and_doing doing_the the_exercise exercise_regularly regularly_.
 so_that that_has has_that that_alleviated alleviated_some some_of of_the the_pain pain_in in_your your_knees knees_and and_.
 um-hum_.
 okay_so so_how how_often often_would would_you you_say say_you you_do do_it it_now now_.
 okay_so so_you you_do do_use use_it it_daily daily_.
 okay_okay okay_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 so_you you_say say_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_to to_take take_narcotics narcotics_because because_of of_the the_addictive addictive_factor factor_.
 and_marijuana marijuana_i i_mean mean_you you_sort sort_of of_caught caught_yourself yourself_there there_marijuana marijuana_still still_.

 or_it it_sort sort_of of_.
 yeah_you you_know know_that that_marijuana marijuana_has has_that that_that that_effect effect_.
 okay_.
 well_what what_other other_health health_problems problems_do do_you you_think think_is is_linked linked_to to_your your_drug drug_use use_.
 okay_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_hard hard_when when_you you_have have_to to_deal deal_with with_the the_pain pain_pretty pretty_regularly regularly_and and_then then_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_surrounded surrounded_by by_people people_who who_.

 all_the the_stuff stuff_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_talking talking_about about_working working_out out_in in_counseling counseling_.

 yeah_that that_must must_have have_been been_really really_hard hard_to to_hear hear_.
 but_look look_here here_you you_are are_.
 you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_all all_these these_emotions emotions_coming coming_at at_you you_and and_.
 okay_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_then then_using using_marijuana marijuana_also also_helps helps_you you_know know_mentally mentally_and and_emotionally emotionally_.
 uh-huh_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_great great_therapy therapy_.
 um-hum_.
 so_where where_do do_you you_think think_you you_go go_from from_here here_then then_at at_this this_point point_.
 okay_.
 yeah_well well_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_lived lived_a a_long long_time time_with with_all all_this this_stuff stuff_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_dealing dealing_with with_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_continuing continuing_to to_deal deal_with with_things things_.
 so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_you you_know know_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_very very_very very_difficult difficult_but but_.
 well_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_here here_you you_are are_though though_you you_know know_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_a a_success success_in in_many many_ways ways_because because_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_lost lost_over over_how how_many many_three three_hundred hundred_pounds pounds_your your_health health_started started_improving improving_when when_you you_were were_doing doing_that that_you you_sought sought_help help_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_seeing seeing_a a_counselor counselor_to to_work work_out out_all all_of of_these these_things things_from from_childhood childhood_time time_and and_you you_know know_that that_impacted impacted_who who_you you_are are_today today_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_sort sort_of of_helping helping_you you_deal deal_with with_everyday everyday_stress stress_too too_and and_you you_want want_to to_change change_on on_a a_scale scale_of of_one one_to to_ten ten_you you_say say_you you_want want_to to_do do_a a_ten ten_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_so so_worried worried_about about_how how_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_to to_manage manage_your your_pain pain_if if_you you_do do_quit quit_.
 yeah_you you_said said_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_into into_the the_pills pills_and and_.
 um-hum_.
 okay_sure sure_but but_now now_you you_know know_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_sort sort_of of_still still_on on_the the_edge edge_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_ready ready_to to_do do_it it_and and_your your_priority priority_at at_this this_point point_really really_is is_your your_mental mental_health health_and and_managing managing_the the_pain pain_at at_a a_level level_at at_a a_manageable manageable_level level_.
 okay_so so_i i_think think_your your_options options_are are_that that_you you_can can_manage manage_your your_using using_marijuana marijuana_.
 you_can can_eliminate eliminate_some some_of of_the the_risks risks_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_some some_of of_that that_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_you you_stay stay_at at_home home_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_driving driving_.
 you_.
 eliminate_the the_risk risk_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_.
 your_other other_option option_is is_not not_to to_change change_at at_all all_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 maybe_the the_best best_thing thing_right right_now now_is is_just just_you you_know know_knowing knowing_that that_being being_aware aware_of of_that that_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 so_you you_trust trust_your your_counselor counselor_then then_.
 they_&apos;re &apos;re_good good_for for_you you_.
 good_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_important important_to to_have have_that that_as as_an an_option option_too too_.
 okay_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_.
 so_when when_you you_are are_ready ready_to to_take take_that that_step step_you you_know know_where where_to to_go go_you you_know know_how how_to to_seek seek_the the_help help_.

 um-hum_.
 are_there there_ever ever_times times_when when_you you_have have_a a_day day_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_hit hit_that that_bump bump_in in_the the_road road_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_use use_drugs drugs_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_but but_if if_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_if if_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_get get_them them_are are_there there_times times_when when_you you_absolutely absolutely_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_get get_them them_.

 tell_me me_about about_that that_.
 um-hum_.
 and_those those_are are_days days_that that_you you_would would_not not_use use_any any_drugs drugs_.
 okay_.
 right_.
 um-hum_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_asking asking_yourself yourself_that that_a a_bit bit_.
 is_it it_have have_you you_been been_asking asking_yourself yourself_that that_a a_bit bit_more more_lately lately_or or_.
 all_the the_time time_.

 so_.
 this_is is_great great_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_you you_know know_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_more more_about about_this this_i i_think think_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_.
 because_with with_every every_step step_you you_know know_thinking thinking_is is_kind kind_of of_the the_beginning beginning_of of_a a_plan plan_.
 so_do do_you you_have have_a a_plan plan_on on_how how_you you_might might_make make_those those_changes changes_.
 have_you you_thought thought_more more_about about_that that_.
 and_tell tell_me me_how how_that that_would would_help help_that that_money money_management management_skills skills_.
 right_.
 and_how how_might might_you you_do do_that that_.
 have_you you_.
 um-hum_.
 um-hum_um-hum um-hum_have have_you you_ever ever_tried tried_to to_kick kick_the the_habit habit_.
 um-hum_.
 okay_so so_when when_that that_serious serious_in in_that that_time time_when when_you you_seriously seriously_tried tried_to to_quit quit_what what_&apos;d &apos;d_you you_do do_.
 you_know know_whatever whatever_works works_is is_not not_crazy crazy_.

 right_right right_.
 um-hum_.
 so_it it_really really_truly truly_to to_me me_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_really really_been been_thinking thinking_about about_this this_pretty pretty_hard hard_.
 and_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_actually actually_gone gone_a a_week week_&apos;s &apos;s_time time_where where_you you_really really_worked worked_and and_did did_probably probably_what what_more more_than than_any any_treatment treatment_program program_could could_do do_.
 no_thank thank_you you_.

 i_think think_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_getting getting_the the_control control_of of_those those_thoughts thoughts_takes takes_practice practice_probably probably_.
 and_you you_have have_a a_week week_of of_practicing practicing_of of_the the_you you_know know_.
 do_you you_think think_about about_trying trying_that that_again again_.
 uh-huh_what what_would would_make make_you you_put put_it it_more more_into into_practice practice_again again_.

 am_i i_hearing hearing_this this_correctly correctly_or or_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_somebody somebody_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_telling telling_me me_that that_they they_&apos;ve &apos;ve_hit hit_rock rock_bottom bottom_that that_they they_are are_really really_looking looking_inside inside_for for_the the_insight insight_and and_the the_control control_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_it it_in in_the the_past past_you you_know know_maybe maybe_a a_short short_time time_but but_it it_was was_a a_beginning beginning_.

 do_you you_.
 you_did did_this this_the the_last last_time time_that that_you you_had had_this this_moment moment_where where_you you_were were_able able_to to_control control_your your_habit habit_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_were were_doing doing_it it_on on_your your_own own_.

 okay_.
 okay_so so_you you_believe believe_it it_should should_be be_lower lower_.

 mm-hmm_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.
 okay_and and_yeah yeah_i i_mean mean_diabetes diabetes_is is_a a_pretty pretty_serious serious_disease disease_and and_it it_requires requires_quite quite_a a_change change_in in_the the_way way_you you_eat eat_and and_just just_the the_lifestyle lifestyle_changes changes_.
 yeah_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_tough tough_thing thing_.
 but_i i_guess guess_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_seeing seeing_a a_doctor doctor_regularly regularly_is is_that that_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_happening happening_.

 mm-hmm_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_well well_accepting accepting_is is_a a_big big_deal deal_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_big big_part part_of of_it it_.

 i_mean mean_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_some some_insight insight_there there_violet violet_is is_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_mm-hmm mm-hmm_and and_now now_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_it it_very very_occasionally occasionally_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 well_how how_important important_is is_using using_marijuana marijuana_now now_say say_on on_a a_scale scale_of of_one one_to to_ten ten_ten ten_is is_the the_highest highest_in in_importance importance_.
 would_you you_put put_it it_.
 okay_.
 well_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_being being_honest honest_with with_yourself yourself_and and_with with_me me_.
 okay_.
 okay_okay okay_so so_why why_not not_give give_it it_a a_lower lower_number number_in in_terms terms_of of_importance importance_.
 okay_so so_you you_rate rate_it it_a a_ten ten_and and_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_see see_rating rating_it it_any any_lower lower_because because_as as_you you_say say_it it_you you_love love_it it_.
 okay_.
 okay_yeah yeah_well well_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_struggling struggling_with with_a a_lot lot_and and_you you_have have_serious serious_regrets regrets_about about_the the_past past_and and_you you_talk talk_about about_your your_depression depression_and and_how how_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_linked linked_in in_to to_your your_mood mood_and and_your your_using using_right right_.
 so_from from_quitting quitting_cold cold_turkey turkey_twenty twenty_.
 well_did did_you you_quit quit_cold cold_turkey turkey_.
 did_you you_say say_that that_.
 okay_.
 okay_so so_have have_you you_ever ever_had had_any any_kind kind_of of_help help_before before_in in_the the_past past_or or_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 have_you you_thought thought_about about_that that_or or_.
 okay_.
 well_what what_do do_you you_think think_what what_do do_you you_think think_would would_happen happen_if if_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_make make_any any_changes changes_as as_far far_as as_using using_at at_this this_point point_that that_you you_say say_once once_a a_week week_if if_you you_maintained maintained_that that_status status_quo quo_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 and_if if_the the_time time_were were_right right_and and_you you_were were_ready ready_to to_do do_it it_what what_would would_that that_look look_like like_.
 need_it it_because because_.
 are_you you_saying saying_you you_need need_it it_because because_it it_really really_helps helps_you you_live live_day day_to to_day day_and and_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 okay_so so_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_even even_see see_yourself yourself_changing changing_at at_this this_point point_.
 mm_okay okay_okay okay_.
 okay_when when_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_listening listening_to to_you you_though though_violet violet_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_seeing seeing_that that_you you_do do_have have_insight insight_to to_your your_marijuana marijuana_use use_because because_you you_talk talk_about about_your your_regrets regrets_with with_your your_kids kids_and and_how how_that that_impacted impacted_them them_so so_certainly certainly_your your_children children_are are_important important_to to_you you_from from_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_you you_talk talk_about about_them them_.
 and_your your_health health_is is_also also_important important_to to_you you_.
 so_those those_are are_things things_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_talked talked_about about_today today_.
 so_you you_might might_not not_be be_ready ready_to to_change change_but but_.
 on_the the_other other_hand hand_you you_also also_talk talk_about about_these these_other other_things things_too too_that that_are are_important important_to to_you you_and and_you you_see see_how how_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_linked linked_to to_your your_health health_also also_.
 right_.
 which_is is_a a_reason reason_why why_twenty twenty_years years_ago ago_you you_were were_so so_addicted addicted_to to_it it_and and_decided decided_not not_to to_do do_it it_because because_of of_your your_failing failing_health health_right right_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 well_yeah yeah_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_through through_a a_very very_hard hard_life life_.
 and_you you_struggle struggle_quite quite_a a_bit bit_.
 okay_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_still still_here here_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_talking talking_about about_it it_and and_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_want want_to to_be be_able able_to to_take take_care care_of of_them them_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_desperately desperately_trying trying_right right_.
 okay_.
 okay_well well_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_seeing seeing_your your_doctor doctor_which which_is is_great great_.
 you_&apos;ll &apos;ll_remain remain_connected connected_to to_your your_doctor doctor_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_very very_important important_.
 um_.
 and_.
 yeah_so so_i i_think think_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_some some_choices choices_though though_violet violet_.
 the_choices choices_are are_really really_you you_can can_manage manage_your your_use use_once once_a a_week week_.
 you_can can_cut cut_down down_if if_you you_want want_to to_right right_.
 the_other other_choice choice_is is_you you_can can_eliminate eliminate_use use_altogether altogether_so so_you you_can can_quit quit_altogether altogether_.
 and_there there_are are_certainly certainly_places places_if if_you you_feel feel_you you_need need_some some_help help_that that_can can_help help_you you_do do_that that_.
 here_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_resource resource_.
 okay_yeah yeah_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_for for_you you_.
 and_you you_know know_what what_if if_you you_want want_some some_more more_information information_about about_marijuana marijuana_and and_cocaine cocaine_and and_those those_kinds kinds_of of_drugs drugs_certainly certainly_i i_can can_give give_that that_to to_you you_.
 would_you you_want want_me me_to to_do do_that that_.
 okay_okay okay_.
 okay_now now_the the_other other_choice choice_you you_have have_is is_not not_to to_take take_risks risks_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_.
 so_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_smoking smoking_pot pot_are are_you you_taking taking_risks risks_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_it it_.
 like_okay okay_are are_you you_.
 okay_.

 because_there there_are are_legal legal_repercussions repercussions_.
 things_like like_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_drive drive_behind behind_the the_wheel wheel_right right_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_high high_.
 okay_.
 and_then then_you you_can can_utterly utterly_make make_no no_change change_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_other other_choice choice_.
 okay_or or_seek seek_help help_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_your your_last last_choice choice_.
 so_this this_is is_one one_here here_if if_you you_do do_choose choose_to to_seek seek_help help_.
 and_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_still still_interested interested_i i_&apos;d &apos;d_love love_to to_be be_able able_to to_send send_you you_that that_information information_just just_for for_you you_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_interested interested_in in_even even_looking looking_at at_it it_if if_you you_haven haven_&apos;t &apos;t_.
 did_you you_want want_me me_to to_do do_that that_.
 oh_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_almost almost_done done_.
 but_i i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_send send_it it_to to_you you_.
 okay_.
 what_is is_your your_address address_by by_the the_way way_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_so so_what what_i i_&apos;d &apos;d_love love_to to_do do_is is_follow follow_up up_with with_you you_with with_a a_phone phone_call call_in in_about about_a a_week week_.
 can_i i_do do_that that_.
 and_what what_would would_be be_a a_good good_number number_.
 mm-hmm_.
 four_four four_six six_.
 okay_so so_this this_is is_your your_cell cell_number number_.
 is_there there_a a_better better_time time_during during_the the_day day_to to_reach reach_you you_or or_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 you_told told_it it_was was_a a_struggle struggle_for for_you you_to to_come come_in in_this this_morning morning_right right_.
 okay_okay okay_well well_so so_the the_goal goal_is is_this this_triangle triangle_right right_.
 the_goal goal_is is_to to_get get_yourself yourself_lower lower_on on_that that_triangle triangle_so so_.
 yeah_so so_think think_about about_it it_a a_little little_bit bit_.
 and_maybe maybe_in in_a a_week week_we we_can can_talk talk_about about_this this_okay okay_about about_this this_triangle triangle_some some_more more_.
 okay_.
 well_yeah yeah_think think_about about_that that_some some_more more_and and_exactly exactly_what what_that that_plan plan_looks looks_like like_.
 okay_.
 okay_excellent excellent_.
 the_time time_is is_twelve twelve_twenty twenty_six six_this this_interview interview_concludes concludes_.
 okay_i i_may may_be be_glancing glancing_at at_this this_every every_so so_often often_to to_make make_sure sure_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_still still_running running_.
 alright_no no_we we_appreciate appreciate_you you_helping helping_us us_out out_with with_this this_because because_naomi naomi_is is_always always_out out_in in_the the_lobby lobby_trying trying_to to_find find_patients patients_who who_can can_help help_us us_out out_with with_this this_so so_it it_go go_okay okay_with with_you you_and and_naomi naomi_.
 the_interview interview_went went_okay okay_.
 any_questions questions_about about_it it_.
 no_.
 okay_well well_she she_basically basically_gave gave_me me_this this_little little_dast dast_form form_drug drug_abuse abuse_screening screening_test test_just just_to to_get get_an an_idea idea_of of_your your_history history_.
 and_you you_mentioned mentioned_alcohol alcohol_the the_pain pain_meds meds_and and_then then_just just_some some_real real_infrequent infrequent_coke coke_and and_marijuana marijuana_.
 sound_about about_right right_.
 and_you you_indicated indicated_you you_wanted wanted_to to_be be_abstinent abstinent_.
 not_so so_or or_.
 okay_thinking thinking_about about_it it_is is_good good_.
 good_tell tell_me me_what what_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_thinking thinking_.
 nothing_not not_much much_.
 uh-huh_.
 oh_boy boy_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 do_you you_.
 and_what what_did did_you you_say say_helps helps_.
 you_said said_something something_helped helped_you you_.
 oh_drinking drinking_.
 oh_i i_see see_what what_you you_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_more more_the the_alcohol alcohol_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_tied tied_in in_to to_making making_you you_feel feel_better better_.
 relieving_the the_pain pain_.
 not_getting getting_enough enough_pain pain_meds meds_.
 yeah_.
 wow_what what_kind kind_of of_pain pain_are are_you you_having having_.
 you_name name_.
 different_results results_.
 uh-huh_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_sounding sounding_familiar familiar_huh huh_.
 no_i i_mean mean_you you_were were_saying saying_you you_used used_to to_hear hear_it it_from from_the the_older older_guys guys_and and_here here_you you_are are_.
 mm_.
 so_can can_i i_take take_the the_lead lead_that that_if if_your your_pain pain_relief relief_was was_better better_you you_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_be be_drinking drinking_as as_much much_.
 is_that that_a a_safe safe_assumption assumption_or or_.
 yeah_.
 yeah_so so_it it_ties ties_in in_like like_you you_said said_.
 it_does does_help help_.
 so_even even_hay hay_fever fever_wow wow_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_finding finding_it it_helps helps_you you_in in_areas areas_.

 you_&apos;re &apos;re_finding finding_a a_few few_benefits benefits_to to_it it_.
 so_it it_helps helps_you you_with with_various various_things things_and and_you you_would would_probably probably_not not_drink drink_as as_much much_though though_if if_your your_pain pain_was was_under under_control control_.
 and_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_and and_the the_homeless homeless_is is_a a_huge huge_part part_.
 can_you you_tell tell_me me_about about_your your_situation situation_your your_homeless homeless_situation situation_.
 what_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 uh-oh_.
 uh-oh_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_bother bother_.
 okay_good good_.
 good_.
 so_far far_.
 okay_.
 right_out out_from from_under under_you you_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 wow_.
 oh_.
 oh_okay okay_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 oh_.
 yeah_.
 where_are are_you you_staying staying_at at_at at_all all_.
 d_s s_c c_.
 okay_.
 so_everything everything_the the_homelessness homelessness_the the_pain pain_even even_your your_allergies allergies_is is_the the_alcohol alcohol_helps helps_cope cope_stress stress_pain pain_relief relief_.
 oh_my my_gosh gosh_.
 does_the the_same same_hold hold_true true_for for_the the_coke coke_and and_the the_marijuana marijuana_.
 or_is is_it it_primarily primarily_the the_alcohol alcohol_that that_helps helps_you you_.
 not_even even_worth worth_talking talking_about about_huh huh_okay okay_.
 alright_not not_worth worth_it it_and and_so so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_why why_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_it it_so so_infrequently infrequently_.
 okay_.
 okay_.
 yeah_.
 so_you you_have have_reasons reasons_not not_to to_mess mess_with with_that that_.
 yeah_yeah yeah_.
 you_mentioned mentioned_earlier earlier_that that_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_low low_on on_the the_priority priority_for for_you you_and and_it it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_help help_.
 and_so so_otherwise otherwise_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_drinking drinking_alcohol alcohol_and and_then then_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_the the_pain pain_meds meds_.
 and_you you_need need_more more_.
 so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_kind kind_of of_like like_the the_two two_are are_in in_one one_depends depends_on on_the the_other other_so so_far far_for for_you you_.
 wow_okay okay_and and_you you_mentioned mentioned_it it_depends depends_on on_the the_doc doc_.
 so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_seeing seeing_different different_docs docs_in in_the the_same same_clinic clinic_.
 no_okay okay_the the_different different_places places_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_gone gone_okay okay_.
 this_one one_is is_okay okay_.

 so_have have_you you_seen seen_the the_same same_doc doc_a a_couple couple_times times_by by_now now_recently recently_.

 okay_.
 okay_.
 so_pending pending_that that_she she_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_think think_about about_the the_pain pain_meds meds_.
 yeah_.
 you_&apos;re &apos;re_obviously obviously_doing doing_it it_for for_a a_reason reason_.
 mm-hmm_.

 yeah_.
 wow_.
 okay_definitely definitely_you you_&apos;ll &apos;ll_know know_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_then then_.
 yeah_.
 sounds_good good_.
 thanks_for for_your your_time time_today today_.
 okay_so so_it it_looks looks_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_off off_and and_running running_.
 so_thank thank_you you_again again_so so_much much_for for_coming coming_in in_and and_for for_being being_willing willing_to to_chat chat_with with_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_.
 did_you you_have have_any any_questions questions_for for_me me_before before_we we_get get_started started_or or_.
 and_how how_did did_it it_go go_the the_whole whole_interview interview_process process_.
 okay_.
 mm_.
 was_she she_able able_to to_kind kind_of of_explain explain_it it_in in_a a_way way_that that_made made_a a_little little_sense sense_.
 okay_.
 alright_so so_like like_i i_said said_today today_is is_just just_gonna gonna_be be_a a_brief brief_conversation conversation_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_just just_gonna gonna_be be_chatting chatting_a a_little little_bit bit_about about_your your_drug drug_use use_and and_if if_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_seen seen_any any_positive positive_or or_negative negative_effects effects_from from_it it_.
 and_so so_one one_of of_the the_questionnaires questionnaires_that that_you you_filled filled_out out_with with_us us_actually actually_is is_called called_the the_drug drug_abuse abuse_screening screening_test test_.
 it_was was_pretty pretty_early early_on on_in in_the the_whole whole_list list_of of_questions questions_it it_was was_kind kind_of of_a a_yes yes_or or_no no_question question_.
 and_so so_would would_it it_be be_okay okay_with with_you you_if if_i i_kinda kinda_go go_over over_what what_your your_score score_was was_on on_just just_the the_questionnaire questionnaire_.
 alright_.
 so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_scored scored_on on_a a_zero zero_to to_ten ten_scale scale_with with_zero zero_being being_no no_risk risk_from from_drug drug_use use_and and_then then_up up_to to_ten ten_which which_means means_that that_there there_could could_be be_potential potential_severe severe_risk risk_that that_people people_report report_sometimes sometimes_from from_drug drug_use use_.
 risk_can can_mean mean_anything anything_from from_maybe maybe_medical medical_effects effects_or or_mental mental_health health_effects effects_or or_maybe maybe_effects effects_that that_they they_&apos;ve &apos;ve_seen seen_in in_their their_lives lives_that that_might might_produce produce_a a_little little_more more_risk risk_because because_of of_the the_drug drug_use use_that that_they they_have have_so so_.
 so_on on_that that_scale scale_of of_zero zero_to to_ten ten_where where_do do_you you_think think_you you_might might_have have_scored scored_.
 okay_so so_you you_were were_thinking thinking_pretty pretty_high high_up up_there there_.
 alright_and and_what what_were were_some some_of of_the the_reasons reasons_why why_you you_thought thought_it it_might might_be be_an an_eight eight_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 okay_so so_you you_think think_it it_might might_be be_drug drug_use use_might might_be be_somehow somehow_related related_to to_health health_issues issues_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_having having_.
 okay_.
 so_you you_actually actually_scored scored_a a_five five_.
 and_we we_can can_kinda kinda_look look_at at_this this_together together_.
 so_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_actually actually_in in_the the_moderate moderate_risk risk_range range_.
 so_actually actually_a a_little little_bit bit_lower lower_from from_what what_you you_originally originally_thought thought_.
 so_what what_are are_your your_thoughts thoughts_about about_that that_.
 oh_i i_guess guess_were were_you you_kind kind_of of_surprised surprised_to to_hear hear_that that_the the_number number_was was_a a_little little_bit bit_lower lower_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_and and_so so_could could_you you_tell tell_me me_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_about about_your your_drug drug_use use_.
 okay_and and_smoked smoked_crack crack_.
 okay_and and_so so_every every_day day_.
 okay_.
 mm_.
 so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_.
 mm_.
 so_it it_kinda kinda_triggers triggers_drinking drinking_.
 okay_.
 so_sort sort_of of_like like_the the_flood flood_gates gates_open open_a a_little little_bit bit_.
 okay_and and_sounds sounds_like like_the the_increase increase_has has_mainly mainly_been been_because because_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_an an_environment environment_where where_people people_are are_asking asking_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.
 mm_where where_are are_you you_living living_right right_now now_.
 pardon_.
 lions_building building_okay okay_.
 and_how how_long long_have have_you you_been been_living living_there there_.
 since_may may_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm_and and_so so_you you_said said_treatment treatment_.
 okay_for for_.
 okay_.
 mm_.
 oh_wow wow_so so_even even_having having_a a_stable stable_place place_to to_live live_somehow somehow_has has_increased increased_it it_because because_of of_everything everything_going going_on on_around around_it it_.
 and_so so_how how_long long_have have_you you_been been_using using_crack crack_for for_.
 okay_.
 and_what what_are are_some some_of of_the the_things things_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_enjoyed enjoyed_about about_using using_.
 mm-hmm_.
 yeah_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_good good_.
 mm_and and_what what_kind kind_of of_appointments appointments_do do_you you_have have_.
 during_the the_week week_.
 oh_.
 okay_.
 so_are are_you you_going going_to to_.
 are_you you_going going_to to_madison madison_.
 how_often often_are are_you you_going going_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm_have have_you you_been been_able able_to to_have have_a a_conversation conversation_about about_that that_with with_your your_madison madison_social social_worker worker_.
 what_were were_some some_of of_the the_things things_that that_she she_said said_.
 okay_so so_she she_wasn wasn_&apos;t &apos;t_sure sure_if if_there there_was was_gonna gonna_be be_any any_kind kind_of of_effect effect_.
 mm-hmm_.
 well_yeah yeah_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_good good_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kind kind_of of_being being_proactive proactive_and and_checking checking_in in_to to_make make_sure sure_if if_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_be be_any any_negative negative_side side_effects effects_from from_it it_.
 oh_okay okay_.

 mm-hmm_.
 so_you you_had had_mentioned mentioned_going going_to to_treatment treatment_recently recently_.
 has_there there_been been_any any_other other_times times_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_tried tried_to to_quit quit_either either_drinking drinking_or or_using using_crack crack_.
 mm-hmm_.
 and_so so_it it_sounds sounds_i i_could could_see see_how how_that that_could could_be be_tricky tricky_of of_.
 you_were were_saying saying_that that_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_necessarily necessarily_pinpoint pinpoint_what what_you you_enjoy enjoy_about about_it it_but but_that that_one one_of of_the the_main main_things things_is is_that that_when when_you you_do do_it it_you you_want want_more more_and and_then then_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_also also_in in_this this_place place_where where_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_constantly constantly_people people_that that_make make_it it_really really_available available_.
 mm-hmm_.

 so_again again_it it_just just_sort sort_of of_almost almost_has has_the the_flood flood_gates gates_and and_things things_kind kind_of of_start start_doing doing_other other_things things_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_got got_you you_to to_kind kind_of of_lose lose_interest interest_in in_certain certain_things things_that that_you you_were were_once once_interested interested_in in_and and_also also_causes causes_some some_financial financial_issues issues_as as_well well_.
 but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_also also_what what_you you_were were_saying saying_was was_when when_you you_have have_appointments appointments_that that_sort sort_of of_helps helps_you you_a a_little little_bit bit_in in_terms terms_of of_maybe maybe_not not_using using_right right_before before_the the_appointment appointment_or or_.
 things_like like_that that_.
 mm-hmm_.
 is_your your_payee payee_through through_madison madison_as as_well well_or or_.
 it_&apos;s &apos;s_different different_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 oh_.
 huh_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_strange strange_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_wow wow_.
 for_just just_a a_month month_.
 hmm_that that_seems seems_kind kind_of of_ridiculous ridiculous_.
 so_how how_do do_you you_feel feel_about about_the the_do do_you you_feel feel_like like_you you_have have_a a_pretty pretty_good good_support support_system system_here here_like like_friends friends_and and_family family_.
 mm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 did_you you_feel feel_like like_treatment treatment_was was_pretty pretty_helpful helpful_for for_you you_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 mm_.
 so_seems seems_like like_treatment treatment_you you_felt felt_like like_was was_pretty pretty_effective effective_and and_then then_before before_you you_were were_living living_in in_an an_area area_where where_the the_temptation temptation_may may_just just_not not_have have_been been_as as_present present_but but_a a_lot lot_of of_it it_just just_seems seems_centered centered_around around_the the_fact fact_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_the the_neighborhood neighborhood_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_right right_now now_.
 okay_did did_you you_have have_some some_programs programs_in in_mind mind_.
 oh_okay okay_.
 is_that that_where where_you you_went went_for for_treatment treatment_before before_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 okay_.
 so_what what_were were_some some_of of_the the_things things_that that_you you_liked liked_about about_treatment treatment_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_having having_that that_community community_having having_other other_people people_that that_have have_kind kind_of of_shared shared_similar similar_experiences experiences_was was_helpful helpful_in in_feeling feeling_like like_maybe maybe_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_as as_alone alone_in in_what what_you you_had had_gone gone_through through_as as_well well_and and_the the_chance chance_to to_do do_cool cool_things things_like like_make make_dream dream_catchers catchers_too too_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 so_keeping keeping_yourself yourself_busy busy_kinda kinda_out out_of of_the the_building building_maybe maybe_sort sort_of of_connecting connecting_with with_other other_people people_who who_may may_not not_be be_using using_as as_much much_you you_think think_would would_make make_more more_of of_a a_difference difference_.
 so_on on_a a_scale scale_of of_zero zero_to to_ten ten_zero zero_being being_not not_at at_all all_and and_ten ten_being being_extremely extremely_how how_important important_would would_you you_say say_it it_is is_for for_you you_right right_now now_to to_change change_your your_drug drug_use use_.
 okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_and and_so so_one one_of of_your your_primary primary_concerns concerns_also also_is is_what what_does does_it it_mean mean_in in_terms terms_of of_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_starting starting_to to_take take_your your_h h_i i_v v_meds meds_and and_then then_also also_using using_as as_well well_.
 and_so so_what what_kind kind_of of_change change_do do_you you_think think_you you_could could_see see_in in_terms terms_of of_your your_drug drug_use use_.
 oh_yeah yeah_i i_guess guess_so so_to to_put put_it it_a a_different different_way way_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_so so_many many_different different_options options_that that_people people_sometimes sometimes_have have_.
 so_for for_some some_people people_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_no no_change change_kinda kinda_continue continue_to to_use use_.
 for_some some_people people_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_cutting cutting_down down_on on_their their_use use_a a_little little_bit bit_.
 okay_.
 so_not not_necessarily necessarily_stopping stopping_cold cold_turkey turkey_but but_just just_sort sort_of of_.
 cutting_down down_more more_.
 okay_.
 oh_okay okay_.
 okay_so so_when when_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_completely completely_stopped stopped_before before_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_feel feel_any any_kinda kinda_sickness sickness_or or_any any_kind kind_of of_craving craving_or or_anything anything_like like_that that_okay okay_.
 okay_.
 and_so so_if if_you you_had had_to to_choose choose_right right_now now_do do_you you_feel feel_like like_then then_you you_would would_want want_to to_sort sort_of of_quit quit_completely completely_or or_cut cut_down down_or or_sort sort_of of_just just_.
 that_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_the the_point point_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_at at_right right_now now_.
 mm_where where_is is_back back_home home_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm_.
 and_so so_how how_possible possible_is is_it it_for for_you you_to to_move move_home home_right right_now now_.
 okay_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kind kind_of of_keeping keeping_in in_the the_back back_of of_your your_mind mind_.
 mm_.

 mm-hmm_.
 so_it it_seems seems_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_considering considering_some some_things things_of of_looking looking_into into_maybe maybe_getting getting_back back_into into_thunderbird thunderbird_again again_looking looking_to to_get get_out out_of of_the the_environment environment_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_living living_in in_.
 you_had had_mentioned mentioned_maybe maybe_looking looking_into into_programs programs_at at_the the_y y_w w_c c_a a_i i_think think_you you_said said_.
 babes_okay okay_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_cool cool_.
 and_you you_had had_said said_also also_that that_you you_have have_some some_friends friends_that that_you you_feel feel_like like_they they_do do_use use_so so_that that_might might_be be_a a_little little_tricky tricky_.
 but_you you_have have_some some_friends friends_that that_also also_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_use use_.
 right_.
 hmm_.
 yup_we we_are are_actually actually_.
 so_did did_you you_have have_any any_questions questions_for for_me me_at at_all all_or or_.
 okay_well well_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_pretty pretty_much much_it it_just just_kind kind_of of_a a_check-in check-in_conversation conversation_sort sort_of of_.
 hmm_.
 oh_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_good good_question question_.
 honestly_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_know know_i i_mean mean_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_a a_certain certain_viewpoint viewpoint_on on_it it_.
 it_sounds sounds_to to_me me_like like_you you_have have_a a_lot lot_of of_options options_available available_to to_you you_.
 from_what what_you you_had had_said said_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_important important_putting putting_it it_on on_a a_ten ten_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_important important_for for_you you_to to_quit quit_and and_cut cut_down down_.
 and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_thinking thinking_a a_lot lot_about about_different different_ways ways_to to_be be_able able_to to_do do_that that_.
 which_is is_great great_.
 i_mean mean_i i_think think_you you_recognize recognize_the the_things things_that that_have have_helped helped_you you_in in_the the_past past_so so_having having_support support_.
 and_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_.
 yeah_but but_having having_the the_community community_being being_around around_people people_who who_you you_feel feel_like like_are are_supportive supportive_of of_you you_and and_maybe maybe_have have_gone gone_through through_similar similar_things things_sounds sounds_like like_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_has has_been been_very very_helpful helpful_to to_you you_.
 and_then then_having having_those those_options options_of of_treatment treatment_or or_getting getting_involved involved_in in_more more_activities activities_out out_at at_the the_y y_w w_c c_a a_.
 and_even even_knowing knowing_that that_going going_back back_home home_is is_an an_option option_as as_well well_.
 it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_have have_a a_lot lot_of of_choices choices_available available_to to_you you_.
 so_and and_you you_sound sound_very very_motivated motivated_about about_wanting wanting_to to_change change_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_and and_what what_you you_had had_said said_too too_is is_the the_biggest biggest_concern concern_right right_now now_seems seems_to to_also also_be be_related related_to to_the the_meds meds_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_starting starting_to to_take take_as as_well well_and and_not not_having having_any any_negative negative_health health_effects effects_from from_using using_.
 so_well well_would would_it it_be be_okay okay_with with_you you_.
 i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_go go_ahead ahead_and and_let let_it it_stop stop_.
 all_right right_now now_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_starting starting_.
 so_thanks thanks_for for_i i_know know_you you_answered answered_a a_lot lot_of of_questions questions_with with_jessica jessica_and and_for for_too too_participating participating_on on_this this_study study_we we_really really_appreciate appreciate_that that_.
 today_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_just just_gonna gonna_have have_a a_little little_conversation conversation_about about_use use_of of_substances substances_.
 i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_here here_to to_tell tell_you you_what what_to to_do do_or or_what what_you you_should should_be be_doing doing_or or_what what_you you_need need_to to_change change_but but_just just_wanna wanna_kinda kinda_chat chat_a a_little little_about about_that that_if if_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_all all_right right_.
 so_one one_of of_the the_questionnaires questionnaires_that that_you you_did did_is is_called called_the the_drug drug_assessment assessment_i i_forgot forgot_what what_the the_s s_stands stands_for for_screening screening_test test_.
 and_it it_kinda kinda_helps helps_assess assess_people people_&apos;s &apos;s_risk risk_for for_their their_use use_of of_substances substances_.
 and_they they_rate rate_it it_on on_a a_scale scale_of of_zero zero_to to_ten ten_with with_ten ten_being being_really really_high high_risk risk_.
 where_do do_you you_think think_you you_might might_rate rate_.
 reefer_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_what what_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 mm-hmm_.
 right_.

 it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_anything anything_.
 mm-hmm_.
 oh_.
