client.c-4	it's just
-	-
client.c-4	gonna be there forever
client.c-4	he doesn't plan on quitting anytime soon and i'm not

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-4	and this last time that i went in there for five days i still wasn't done with that still rocking and rolling
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	( and uh ) but oh my god but i mean ( like ) we did eleven grams in three days plus we bought a couple more eight balls
client.fn	so within just two weeks man ( we had did ) my habit went way up
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	and then i get arrested
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	the worst possible time to
client.fn	but i'm glad ( we used to ) the cops always bugged us because we were sleeping in our car and everything
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	we tell them we're get us off the hill i said we're gonna get ourselves off the hill
client.fn	yeah so ( they ) they're always trying to find something on him and me because ( they ) they heard that ted's dealer
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i was supposed to be dealing heroin or cocaine [du] and ted was supposed to be dealing the other one
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i don't know who they got this information from but i never deal in my life
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i go get it for somebody and get a little [du] out of it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i never sat there and did all that and if i did it was ( like ) only a couple times for somebody
client.fn	there's a lot of snitches out there that can really ruin your day
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	[du] you are working with somebody that has something if they ask you for a front and you say no expect something to happen
client.fn	they call the police and they yeah
counselor.rec	it sounds like it's hard to trust people yeah
counselor.rec	in that environment
client.fn	yeah this girl that she actually called us on the phone had a room full of people [du]
client.fn	it's a shooting gallery that place was
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and she said to us over the phone that if you don't give me a hit i'm calling the cops on you guys
client.fn	[du] what you [du]
client.fn	we got her up there and my husband just fucking yanked her and threw her on the floor and sat on top of her
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	he was ready to cram a rock down her mouth
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	and we said what we thought of it and didn't lay a hand on her or anything
client.fn	gave her the rock ( and ) and it was a big big fat about thirty dollar rock
-	-
client.fn	and she took the rock and turned around and leave with it and i go oh no you're smoking that right here
client.fn	and ted put the whole damn thing on there
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and they take it and she turned around and walked out not ten minutes later called us again and again [du] she was gonna call the cops [du]
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	i hope i never meet her again
client.fn	but we're away from that area so i don't have to worry about that
client.fn	we used to live right down corner and ( jefferson ) jefferson and james
-	-
counselor.rec	it seems like that might be one of the drawbacks though right of
client.fn	jefferson and
-	-
client.fn	boren
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah that's right there by the soup kitchen
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	where all the ( um ) homeless hang out
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	or in the morning they're not
-	-
counselor.rec	it seems tricky right
client.fn	we're out on aurora
-	-
client.fn	now so we don't know anybody out there
client.fn	of course there's a lot of drug dealing and prostitution
client.fn	but we don't have to go out i mean [laugh] my husband and i ( uh ) we're very happy we have munchies and sit in front of the t_v watching t_v now
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	all that partying and hanging on the street corners and trying to find somebody to get something just so we could get a a hit
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( it o* ) that's over mm-hmm i'm just so glad
counselor.rec	so it sort of shift
-	-
counselor.rec	it shifted for you now from something that might have been more like fun partying thing to now ( it's it ) the way you described it as ( sort of it's ) kind of how you guys start your day and have each day and there's ( like ) a routine involved
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( it's we've ) we've never changed anything about our habits ever it's always been before we had to wake up [du] before dinner about i pretty much never changed
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+4	but we're getting just big habits again
counselor.quc	does it get expensive or
client.fn	i want ( do you ) do you know much about methadone
-	-
counselor.gi	i actually don't i'm afraid
client.fn	oh okay
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	well you see i was wondering ( um ) people can detox off of methadone to where they don't get sick
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and methadone is worse than heroin ( i've been s* ) i got sick ( uh ) from taking that and i was sick for five days straight
-	-
counselor.res	so you've taken methadone before
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and it seems like we should be able to do that with heroin
-	-
counselor.res	so just kind of wean yourself off
client.fn	just taper down [du]
-	-
client.fn	completely i've never tried it but
-	-
counselor.gi	i think it depends for different people so i think for some people methadone might be the most effective for them for some people they might be able to wean themselves off on their own
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	i don't know what the statistics are on ( which it ) which tends to help more people
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	but ( you know ) i think everyone's a little different and
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	so just like everyone is i think at a different point too with their lives where ( you know ) some people are kinda happy and fine with the point that they're at with the amount that they're using
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	some people ( you know ) want to cut down some people want to ( you know ) ( or at least s* ) some people want to use in a way that's safer ( all ) there's a bunch of other varieties so
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	oh yeah
-	-
client.r-4	i do it just because nothing else is there that's how we got hooked on it
counselor.fa	hmm
client.r-4	because there's no other drug in the house except somebody that had it
counselor.fa	mm
client.r-4	( and ) and they knew what they were doing though they always giving us free hits all the time until we got sick and it took us about five days though before we woke up from it mm i don't feel so good
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	[laugh] fuck the [du] and fuck the heroin
-	-
counselor.quc	and what were you using before that
-	-
client.fn	( a* ) alcohol we used to drink alcohol twenty_four hours a day and we traded the alcohol for the heroin
-	-
counselor.rec	mm and as you were describing it it was sort of like it sounds like you might have been kind of tricked into that situation a little bit by the person who was there
client.fn	mm
client.fn	mm
-	-
client.r+a1	yeah ( it ) i know one thing though i can't go back to alcohol
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+1	i drank ( uh ) a half a can of beer one day and my liver oh man it ( felt ) felt like one of my ribs was broken my liver swelled up that bad just from a half a can of beer then
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+1	and it kill me now i know it if i started drinking
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+1	( i ) it felt like a rib was broke
client.fn	and ( they tell me that ) my doctors told me that my liver is and i have to take so many pills anyway
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	it's gonna destroy my liver just by the medicines they give me
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.quo	so how do you feel about some of the health problems that are going on for you right now
-	-
client.fn	oh i don't like it
client.fn	and i came in here to ask them to help me and they just keep bouncing me back and forth to different doctors and nothing is being done nothing
counselor.gi	that's
client.fn	i haven't gotten a straight answer yet or anything
-	-
counselor.quo	what were some of the questions you were asking them
-	-
client.fn	oh ( about ) about the [du] and if i'm doing it right or where is the best place and ( um ) if i can get pain meds ( for )
client.fn	because ( it ) it hurts really bad i mean [du] in a place you can hardly walk
client.fn	but i ended up in here it was about ten years ago i almost died because an abscess in my hip had turned to gangrene
counselor.su	wow
client.fn	and i had to i had to get in here real quick [du]
-	-
client.fn	i mean i could tell you all the bad stories
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	i've overdosed about six seven times
client.fn	do you know what ( people think ) people think that you should know something [du] i mean since they tell you that you overdosed and that you quit breathing and you were purple
client.o-4	it doesn't bother us because we don't remember it
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.o-4	we're not scared it happened because ( you know ) [du] eyes closed and eyes open [du] you're asking where's your head where's my head
-	-
counselor.rec	so the overdosing isn't as scary but it sounds like what you had described of that having that sensation you had recently of feeling weird kinda scary numb yeah that sounds like it was pretty terrifying
client.fn	yeah
client.o-4	i didn't even know i overdosed
client.fn	yeah yeah more [du] yeah
client.fn	uh-huh
counselor.rec	huh seems like there's been some close calls some scary things
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.r+d4	mm-hmm yup and then i hate it when you're conscious where you didn't take enough of it to black you out completely but you can't move
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i had my eyes open i couldn't move my arms or legs ( i couldn't move ) i couldn't talk at all and it was a room full of people
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	and everybody ran out the door except my husband and this little mexican guy his name is shorty
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and they dragged me into the kitchen and ( they ) they wanted to put me in a shower but this guy knew ( what ) what to do i guess he's ( g* ) helped people before or has seen it
client.fn	he says no you don't put them in the shower and he's just sitting there holding my head not [du] get in my eye and i can't i'm saying this shorty i can't breathe i can't breathe
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	and i'm standing up but he just started breathing for me
counselor.su	mm scary
client.fn	and ( uh ) not a minute later i started coughing and i just went oh [du] okay [du]
client.fn	and he took off in case somebody would call the cops on him or something
-	-
counselor.quo	so i'm wondering ( what ) what was ( like ) going on in your head at the time when that was happening
counselor.quo	what were you thinking or feeling
-	-
client.fn	( oh i was ) oh i thought i was going for good
client.fn	my husband said afterwards they gave me that one hit of heroin he said that ( he ) i looked at him and i said i'm going now
client.fn	that's the exact feeling i had it was like i was falling ( like ) falling so fast you can't slow yourself down and it makes you nauseous and it's like jumping out of a airplane without a chute
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
client.fn	it takes your breath away completely ( and ) and it takes so long i mean
-	-
counselor.quc	to wear off you mean
-	-
client.fn	nah i mean to pass out unconscious from not breathing
client.r+4	one two three four about three minutes two and a half minutes is an eternity when you can't breathe right that's torture there
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.su	that is
-	-
counselor.su	incredibly long time
-	-
client.r+4	mm-hmm especially when you can't do anything about it
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	but the thing is most of the time i overdosed was the first year i was doing it
client.fn	( i w* ) i had other people make it up and the other people put ( as mu* ) i don't know how much
-	-
client.fn	i didn't know how much i was supposed to do and they didn't know how much i should do
client.fn	and so they ended up overdosing me they'd give me exactly what they're taking
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i got about five different people ( you know ) in two years
counselor.fa	oh wow
-	-
counselor.rec	so ( i mean ) it seems like that you've seen some scary things gone through some scary things and ( um ) had to deal with people that are maybe not the most trustworthy
client.fn	mm
client.fn	yeah oh yeah
counselor.res	( um ) but ( you know )
client.fn	i've seen
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) i was with a friend of mine and ( she was ) we were out by the museum over there
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( uh ) and she was in a truck with me she was shooting up heroin and she's just trying to do a little bit and she goes ooh i got it right off you know
client.fn	and talking talking talking to her and she wasn't answering and like [du] what what
-	-
client.fn	and she had overdosed and she wasn't breathing
counselor.su	oh no
client.fn	i jumped out of my truck and i got this black guy that was friends with us we all knew each other and kinda like that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	he came in the truck and dragged her out
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but before he took her out of the truck he was going through her pockets he was going underneath her bra he was going in her socks he just wanted the dope
-	-
counselor.res	to look for oh
-	-
client.fn	before he even help her
counselor.fa	oh
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	and there was ( a ) a medic ambulance right there at a gas station
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i mean ( like only you know ) i could have yelled and they could hear me
client.fn	and this guy wouldn't let me yell at them wouldn't let me contact them at all
client.fn	he was gonna find the dope on her no matter what it took how long and i don't think he would have helped her
-	-
client.fn	and i was going man don't ever come around me don't ever that is so cruel
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.su	that's gotta be a horrible thing to watch yeah
client.fn	that is
-	-
client.fn	they just want your drugs and kick you to the curb
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	ooh
-	-
counselor.rec	when getting dope becomes more important than helping save someone's life yeah
client.fn	that is scary
client.fn	( i've )
-	-
client.fn	i've only seen that kind of stuff on movies until then
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i've never seen something so fucking
client.fn	and when tess got out of the hospital she said this guy was really a good good friend ( you know ) they hung out together and [du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	( i said ) i told her exactly what he did
-	-
client.fn	i said he wouldn't even let me breathe for you let nobody near you
client.fn	and he wanted the dope he thought we maybe he thought we were getting the dope from her or something
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i don't know i was trying to figure out why he'd do something like that
-	-
client.fn	that's the only reason i could come up with he thought we were ripping her off and he wanted to get it first
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	it's weird
-	-
counselor.su	but still yeah to watch someone do something like that
client.fn	i would never ever
-	-
client.fn	if somebody collapsed in front of me i'd never ever ever never leave them on the floor
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	i'd make sure they were breathing right or something
client.fn	( uh i ) i know how to give c_p_r and all that i wouldn't [du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	there's so many of them that just disappear [du] they just take off without helping people
counselor.fa	mm
-	-

counselor.quc	is that something that you're that you're looking into

client.fn	( e* ) everyone has told me that these doctors don't and they won't give you methadone because of drugs they'll give it to you for pain management
counselor.fa	mm

client.fn	not really no
-	-
counselor.gi	no okay and so ( um )
-	-
client.fn	a little bit but [nvv] not too much
-	-
counselor.res	not too much
counselor.gi	( and ) and so just to kinda the basics of it we're trying to see if ( um ) doing a brief talk with someone like this ( uh ) makes any impact on their drug use and then in turn ( um ) impact on their health or other areas of their life
counselor.gi	but ( you um ) you probably went through that
-	-
counselor.gi	initial interview was about an hour an hour and a half
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	they asked you a lot of yes or no kinda questions about your health legal issues relationships ( um ) drug use and stuff like that
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.st	and so what we wanna do here is kinda shift gears and give you more of an opportunity just to speak about how drug use fits into your life ( and uh and ) and kinda just go from there
-	-
counselor.gi	( you know ) this is more about you telling me making me understand how this plays a part in your life
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	and as a topic of change comes up it's this isn't an instance where i'm trying to sell you on anything or ( um ) shove any philosophies down your throat or anything like that and we'll just keep it real open
-	-
client.fn	okay well ( uh ) the reason i've always just well i've always just smoked marijuana or drank alcohol
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( that is just ) it's all i've ever done
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-1	and ( uh ) the reason for it is because i've always had a problem sleeping at night
counselor.fa	mm
client.r-1	so i would always make myself numb as possible so i would be able to pass out at night
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.res	so you've had
-	-
client.fn	and now i'm taking ( um ) acetametaphines for allergies
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so that it'll help me sleep at night
client.fn	it's just ( i ) i gotta have something
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	and so it's well marijuana's been helping me with the pain i've been having lately
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	my wrists have been bothering me a lot lately and my shoulder's always been bothering me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	( what uh ) what's wrong with the shoulder and the wrists
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) arthritis
-	-
counselor.res	arthritis
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.res	pretty painful
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and i'm just coming off of surgery with my leg
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	crushed my leg tib_fib
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	[du] ( um ) tibial plateau fracture tib_fib fracture
counselor.fa	hmm
client.fn	and that was keeping me going there
client.r-2	actually i was smoking because it would settle my stomach
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	and i would be able to eat
client.r-2	because i mean i was down to a_hundred_and_fifty pounds
-	-
counselor.res	so you weren't eating very much
-	-
client.r-2	i wasn't eating anything
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so marijuana really serves a lot of different functions for you
-	-
client.r-2	yeah it does
counselor.res	it was
-	-
counselor.res	it was helping you sleep ( um ) it's been helping you through ( some ) some recent pain and also helping you settle your stomach
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	( um ) and so even though you've got these allergy medicines that are kinda helping you sleep a little bit better it also ( um ) it still helps with the pain ( and the ) ( um ) and digestion ( or ) or help settle your stomach
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah the internal digestive system
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
-	-
client.r-2	it just kinda settles the nerves down a little bit
-	-
counselor.res	mm-hmm oh okay so some of that is ( like ) some of that's from nervousness
-	-
client.r-2	yeah and just [nervous sound effect]
-	-
counselor.quo	what's that
-	-
client.r-2	it's just running a mile a minute
-	-
counselor.quc	oh okay what your brain
counselor.quc	or your mind
client.fn	yeah when i was
-	-
client.fn	before i hurt my leg i was a cook on the line
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and for twenty years that's my life is i ran a mile a minute
counselor.fa	oh okay
client.fn	that's all i ever knew how to do
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i broke my leg again and i was bouncing off the walls because i couldn't do anything
counselor.res	yeah you couldn't
counselor.res	do anything
client.fn	i'm in a wheelchair and it's like oh god
counselor.su	oh man
-	-
counselor.res	that didn't fit you very well [laugh]
client.fn	no so
-	-
client.fn	so i went back to school to become a baker
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and just kinda slow me down a little bit gear me down because i'm forty_nine i'm getting a little older and
-	-
counselor.rec	so it keeps you active but helps you slow down at the same time
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	and ( um ) so ( like in ) in so you're using marijuana for sleep pain anxiety
counselor.quo	( like how ) how does your day look with using marijuana
counselor.quo	( like ) how does it fit into your day
counselor.quc	( like ) when you're using it
counselor.quc	and how much that kind of stuff
-	-
client.o-2	oh ( um ) just a couple hits ( like ) in the morning with my medicine
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	because i'm on other painkillers and stuff like that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	and ( um ) it usually settles my stomach because it's the medicine i'm taking is ( uh ) irritating to the stomach
counselor.fa	mm
client.r-2	and i don't always got time to eat until i get to work and then ( you know ) it's usually too late to take my medicine
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r-2	so ( y* you know ) the marijuana usually settles my stomach
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	so that i'm able to focus on the day instead of ( you know ) just ( um ) this pain oh my stomach's upset because ( you know ) my medicine's tearing up my guts and just stuff like that
-	-
counselor.res	i see ( so ) so it really helps so if you're not using it you're thinking the pain is more prevalent or you're focused more on the pain
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r-2	i'm focusing on the pain
-	-
counselor.gi	( and then ) and then i'm assuming that interferes with other things or makes the pain hurt more or
client.r-2	with every step
-	-
client.r-2	it drags the whole day out
-	-
counselor.res	it drags the day out okay
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.res	okay and so this helps you so that you can focus on other things
-	-
client.r-2	and usually i get cranky ( you know ) and i'm dealing with the public too and i don't wanna be on edge i don't like to be cranky or on edge when i'm dealing with the public like that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	as a cook
-	-
client.fn	or a baker
-	-
counselor.res	as a baker
-	-
client.fn	because ( you know ) when i'm not baking then i'm on the front of ( the ) the shop type of thing
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	interacting mingling and stuff like that
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	exactly
counselor.rec	okay and if you didn't have marijuana you'd be too edgy to
-	-
client.o-2	i would be angrier i would be not angrier but i would be in pain more i would be on edge i wouldn't be very social
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah you'd be a little more irritable you'd be like withdrawn or something
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.o-2	bite your head off and
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	[du]
counselor.rec	( and ) and you're probably the kinda guy that if you're feeling that way because you're a social guy that you kinda turn away from people
-	-
client.r-2	yeah and people are like well gene ( wh* ) what's up with the attitude it's like ( just ) just don't you don't wanna know
-	-
counselor.res	they notice yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	yeah i see
counselor.rec	and almost it sounds like in a sense you wouldn't wanna you'd feel like you were burdening them if you were telling them about all your pain and stuff so
client.fn	exactly
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and ( you know ) there's no cry babies in the shop
-	-
counselor.res	oh okay so you can't really talk about it
client.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	no
counselor.res	you don't have an outlet for talking about your tendency
client.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( uh ) you know what tell it to the mirror [laugh]
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so smoking in a way helps you maintain that having to ( keep it ) keep it all to yourself
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+d1	and i don't like drinking that much
client.r-2	so it keeps me away from drinking
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	my fiancee doesn't drink she doesn't like when i drink that much
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	so ( i i you know ) i'll maybe go to the bars twice a week once a week when i'm smoking
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	you feel like you would drink more if you weren't smoking
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.o-1	just to try to get to that unconsciousness level
-	-
counselor.quc	were you trying to kinda
counselor.rec	like you said before i think you said something like numb yourself out or ( especially at ) especially at night but during the day when you're working just to keep the edge off so you can interact with people
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	well i don't drink at work i never have
counselor.fa	right
counselor.res	but the
client.fn	i never have
-	-
counselor.res	the okay so ( no ) no drinking at work
counselor.res	but that's what the marijuana's for
counselor.res	and if you weren't using marijuana you'd be using alcohol to achieve the same effects ( at least at ) at least at night
client.fn	yeah
client.o-1	yeah at night
counselor.fa	yeah okay
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( i don't ) i don't drink during the day or at work
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+1	i cut that nail off too many times drinking at work [nvv] son of a
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
client.fn	look for your nail and [du]
counselor.rec	don't want it to be a finger
-	-
client.fn	put a bandaid on it and stuff and
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i mean just shaved it right off
-	-
counselor.rec	( s* ) so the difference between using alcohol at work and marijuana at work there's
client.fn	smoking marijuana
client.fn	it's it's
client.r-2	a big difference
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	big difference
counselor.res	you wouldn't cut your finger off with marijuana
-	-
client.r-2	no no i'm ( more car* ) more calm collected
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	okay so let me see ( if i ) if i got everything that we've been talking about
counselor.rec	and ( that's ) that's you experience a lot of pain experience ( um s* ) some problems with your stomach both because of anxiety and because of medication you're taking ( um ) and also being at work ( uh ) being edgy at work and stuff like that
-	-
client.r-2	it is high stress
counselor.res	high stress
client.r-2	yeah ( it's ) it's very up there
-	-
counselor.rec	right and so smoking marijuana in a sense helps you with all that stuff it helps you sleep it helps your stomach helps you ( f* uh ) it takes off the edge at work also so that you don't have to
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r-2	it helps me focus
-	-
counselor.res	it helps you focus that's right you said that
-	-
client.r-2	it helps me focus
-	-
counselor.res	it helps you focus
-	-
client.r-2	instead of having twenty things going on at once i'll do seven at a time oh yeah multitasking
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	and so there wouldn't be a way to do that ( with ) with the pain that you have or [du]
client.r-2	no
client.r-2	i i j* get
client.r-2	scatterbrained
counselor.rec	mm-hmm so it really helps you be able to do things that you wouldn't be able to do otherwise mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	( um ) yeah so i mean it sounds like it really ( adds ) adds to your life in a way that it makes things a lot ( uh ) more manageable
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	( um ) so i mean it sounds like there's just quite a bit of positives there
counselor.gi	and ( um ) i noticed on your sheet here it said that you're just you're looking more at ( controlled ) controlled use right
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	( like ) what do you mean by that
-	-
client.o-2	( um you know ) not just oh well i think i'll just smoke ( it's ) it's more or less ( just just um ) just when i need it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-2	( you know ) or even edibles it's not even just smoking ( um ) i'd like to get into the edibles
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	( like uh ) baking it into kinda [du]
client.fn	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah i've got my
-	-
client.fn	my ( uh ) green card my license i_d
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i go to the distributor and ( um ) they've got all kinds of fine edibles and stuff
-	-
counselor.rec	( for ) oh for the medical marijuana
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	oh okay wow so ( you might ) you might start jumping into that so it sounds like that seems maybe a little bit better or different than
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	because ( you know ) i ride my bike a lot and i don't wanna wreck my lungs
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	i mean ( there's ) there's other things out there to help but i just don't have the money for it
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah so if i'm hearing you right then ( there's something about ) there's something about not using it so recreationally and also trying ( to ) to ( um ) watch out for your health and stuff like that too
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	is that right
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	and ( what i* ) what is it about
counselor.quo	( like what's ) what's
counselor.gi	there must be a difference between ( using the recreationally ) using it ( recreati* )
counselor.gi	i can't talk today
-	-
counselor.quo	recreationally versus using it the way you're using it
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) it's been so long i don't even remember
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	i remember we used to sit there when i was living in detroit and we would just smoke and smoke and smoke and smoke and smoke and smoke until there was nothing left
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and it's and then we would drink and drink and drink ( you know ) after work
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	we'd just binge
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and then you wake up in the morning your lungs are burning and you got hot pipes and you're like [gasp]
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	and all your money's gone
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	and all your stuff is gone
counselor.fa	oh man
client.fn	and you're like well wait a minute this isn't right [laugh]
counselor.nc	[laugh]

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and it's just a whole other ballgame it's easier ( to to ) to
-	-
client.fn	get my hands on
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	to ( um ) i don't have to worry about ( you know ) taking it with me all the time because ( i j* ) i just leave it at home
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i'm not getting in trouble like i used to it's just it's a whole different ballgame
-	-

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	it's like i've worked with state cops and ( you know ) from flint and around pontiac area
counselor.fa	yeah

counselor.st	well and i kinda took us off track there but
counselor.gi	i was excited you were from michigan

counselor.rec	so there was something different between then and now where you were getting in trouble where you weren't able to keep it at one place
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	more like [sigh] ( you know ) you can't do it so you do it more
client.fn	i mean ( you know ) see if you can get away with it
client.r-2	well here ( it's ) it's no big deal so ( it ) it's i don't even think about it i just leave it at home and that's where it stays
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm there's almost something maybe kind of rebellious about it before but you it almost seems like you look somehow that wouldn't fit into your life now that
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	hmm-mm
-	-
client.r+2	no not with the person i'm with and the goals in my life and stuff like that and

counselor.res	( you ) you can keep it at your house now you were moving it around a lot before
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	okay so you've there's something about being more stable too that and ( in this ) it sounds like in this relationship where you're feeling like ( i'm ) i'm kinda being the ( you ) you're being very aware of what you're doing and how you're using
client.fn	mm-hmm

counselor.fa	yeah yeah
client.fn	i mean they think i'm billy_bad_ass because i'm not afraid to walk down the street
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	it's like that's not it that's not it at all it's just there's nothing to be afraid of [du]
-	-
counselor.rec	so ( it's like a ) it's like a load off really
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	it really is
counselor.af	mm-hmm well that's excellent
counselor.res	( it sounds like um ) yeah i mean it sounds like coming out here
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	let me shut this off
counselor.fa	all right
-	-
counselor.rec	this it sounds like it's made ( a ) a huge impact on you and it sounds like there's big differences and there's been a lot of things affecting how you view for one drinking and then two ( like ) the way you use marijuana ( you've al* ) you've used it for a long time but you're using it really kinda more of a mindful manner using it for ( uh ) there's a purpose to it
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	( um ) has there ever been a time ( where ) where it's ( b* ) been an interference
counselor.res	( in ) in i mean it sounds like you've got a pretty good routine with it
client.fn	um
counselor.quc	has it ever interfered
client.r+2	well i always spend
-	-
client.r+2	a lot of i just spend too much money on it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	that's about it
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah ( s* s* ) so so it doesn't really interfere with activities but it does cost a lot of money
client.r+2	financially
client.fn	mm-hmm yeah
counselor.res	you find yourself spending more
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	especially when ( you ) you go through somebody who's illegal and the price is so much higher
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	and now i'm going to a distributor that's legal and the prices doesn't have to be that high
-	-
counselor.rec	it's better
-	-
client.fn	yeah and it's better quality
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	so it's just so you know it's gonna be safer and ( uh ) it's safer and it's cheaper
client.r-2	yes
-	-
client.fn	yeah well it's a lot safer because they actually put chemicals on the marijuana to make it addicting
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	in its true form it is not addicting but they put chemicals into it that make it addicting
counselor.fa	oh i see
counselor.res	keep you buying
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	[laugh] and the distributors ( you ) you've looked into it they don't do that
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-2	nothing no it's all clean
counselor.af	oh good
client.fn	yeah i read that they get a little ( um ) buyer's bible or grower's bible
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	stuff like that it's pretty neat
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah so you have been very mindful about that
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah oh yeah i've been doing research and stuff like that
-	-
counselor.quo	mm-hmm ( um ) i wonder how the cost has affected your use in purchasing and
-	-
client.fn	well i don't buy as much as i used to anymore
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+2	but ( um you know ) because my fiancee's not working right now so we've got priorities
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know ) i'm not stupid [laugh]
client.o-2	but ( you know ) once she's working i might get a little bit more
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-2	but right now it's just i'm not getting that much at all a couple grams a week
-	-
counselor.rec	right so ( it's really the ) it's really about if you could fit it in or not how it fits into the budget it's not like you're saying like oh i need marijuana i'm gonna go out and buy a bunch
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yeah this part of my check is for rent this part is for marijuana
counselor.res	you're
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( like ) nah after it's all said and done it's like well ( you know )
client.fn	or i'll go to the plasma center if i have a day off i'll go to the plasma center and get twenty bucks and i'll go buy it with that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.fa	okay yeah
client.fn	so you know
counselor.rec	so you're not it's not coming straight out of your budget you're doing a little something extra to get the extra money to get it
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah a little something extra for a little something extra
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah well there you go that makes sense
counselor.st	okay well ( um ) the last thing that i would kinda run through is just kinda what we call ( uh ) a menu of options
counselor.gi	just ( so i'm i'm so and ) so i'm not not making assumptions about what your decisions are at this time
counselor.gi	( um ) and let me see if i can remember these [laugh]
-	-
counselor.adw	well so the different options ( that ) that you would have would be ( you know ) not really changing anything
counselor.adw	( um ) using ( uh ) in ( like ) a conscious mindful kinda manner
counselor.adw	quitting ( compet* ) completely
counselor.adw	( um ) seeking support
counselor.gi	and let me see if i can think of the other one
-	-
counselor.gi	i can't
counselor.gi	but ( you kinda get the ) you kinda get the jist
-	-
client.fn	it's not using at all right at the bottom there
client.fn	i'm gonna go with number two using it in a controlled manner
-	-
counselor.res	mm-hmm so make sure you're using it in a controlled manner
counselor.rec	and it seems like you've been really mindful about it
counselor.quc	( um ) are there ( any ) any is there anything else that you would do ( to ) to make sure that ( you s* ) you continue to do that
counselor.quc	or is there still other changes that you would make ( or be ) where it would be like oh this is even more mindful
-	-
client.fn	at ( the pre* ) the present right now i don't know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i mean anything's possible
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know they're ) they wanna put me on another medication another pain medicine
client.fn	so i'm gonna try that he said for about three weeks two three weeks and see ( you know ) once it gets to that plateau let it level off
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and we'll see how that goes
-	-
client.fn	but ( you know ) i'm not married to any new ideas
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i'm always open
-	-
counselor.rec	right so ( it sound ) it sounds like waiting for ( that medica* cause you don't know ) how that medication's going to affect you and so based on that you don't know if you might use a little more ( or ) or need to use a little less of something less so you have to stay kinda open to that
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	but it sounds like overall you've been pretty mindful and you wanna make sure that you stay mindful about how you're using it ( and ) and using it in a controlled manner
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	excellent
counselor.quo	well okay ( uh ) and how was this for you
client.fn	that sounds about right
-	-
client.fn	good good it's not bad
-	-
client.fn	good
counselor.rec	maybe different than you anticipated [laugh]
-	-
client.fn	i really ( didn't know what ) didn't know what
counselor.res	didn't know what to expect
client.fn	i didn't know if it was gonna be some old guy in a white coat or ( you know )
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.gi	it's just me it's just me
client.fn	yeah

client.fn	okay
counselor.af	( um ) so appreciate you coming back again ( um ) for this
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	and just wondering ( what ) how much you know about ( this ) this next step here in the
client.fn	okay
-	-
client.fn	i don't know about the next step you're talking about
counselor.gi	[du]
-	-
counselor.gi	you and i our conversation
counselor.quc	what did naomi tell you about what we're gonna talk about or
-	-
client.fn	no i don't know what you're gonna tell me or talk about
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	so ( what what ) what this is is just meant to be kind of a conversation between you and i about your drug use
counselor.quo	( um ) and i'd kinda like to know ( what you ) how you feel about it
counselor.quo	( um ) what's working for you what's not working for you about it
counselor.quo	just sort of generally if you wouldn't mind starting off by telling me a little bit about that
-	-
client.fn	( um ) well recently ( i ) i used ( crack and ) crack cocaine and i did that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	and ( i ) i felt guilty about it after i was done with it
client.r+n3	and still need to throw away ( that uh ) that paraphernalia that i got
client.r+3	and it's something that i don't really feel good about
client.r+d3	and i don't like it
client.r+3	i ( don't ) felt bad about it after i was done with it
client.fn	and i did do marijuana before and that was kind of recently too but that
-	-
counselor.quo	so what don't you like about it
-	-
client.r+3	it costs too much
client.r+3	it's ( um ) makes your heart go fast and it's
-	-
client.fn	and that's about it
-	-
counselor.quc	okay are there things that you do like about it
-	-
client.r-3	it's just the high
-	-
counselor.res	so you like the high but it increases your heart rate and it costs too much
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	and it sounds also like it makes ( you ) you just you feel guilty
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	it makes you feel badly because you feel guilty
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	can you tell me a little bit more about that
-	-
client.r+3	well i shouldn't be doing it
client.r+3	and it's illegal
client.fn	( um ) it's
-	-
client.r+3	it's bad for you
client.r+3	( uh ) i know it's bad
client.r+3	and ( i ) i do it because ( you know ) when i drink too much sometimes i do that because ( it's ) it's so much ( that there ) it's all around me
client.fn	not all around me
client.r+3	but it's ( it's uh ) easy accessible to get
client.o+3	and when i'm not drinking i would never touch it
-	-
counselor.rec	so when you ( it's ) alcohol it sounds like maybe impacts or affects your thinking so that you're maybe not as clear about the consequences or the things that you don't like about it when you're drinking
client.r+1	yeah it does
-	-
client.r+1	yeah yeah that's true
counselor.fa	alright
client.r+d1	yeah that's one thing i don't like
client.r+3	yeah it's something that's bad for you and something that shouldn't have been done
-	-
counselor.rec	so you got a lot of reasons excuse me ( to not use ) to not use crack because ( it it's you don't like the way ) well it sounds like you don't like the way it makes you feel physically spending ( money ) too much money it's illegal it's bad for you you [nvv] ( you know ) it causes health problems so you had all those things ( that you know ) that you don't like about it
client.r+3	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	but on the other hand when you're drinking maybe you're not thinking those things
client.r+1	oh yeah
counselor.quo	well ( you so what do you think about ) what do you think you might do about that
-	-
client.r+n1	well i gotta stop drinking first
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+n1	and ( uh ) stop those thoughts
client.r+1	when i drink it's just like ( i ) i get careless about my money and ( uh uh i ) if it's right by me i'll say yeah i'll have some i'll buy some and they'll give me the paraphernalia to smoke it and i'll do it
client.o+3	and but if i weren't drinking ( i ) i wouldn't even think about it or even get close to it
-	-
counselor.rec	oh so if you weren't drinking but yet you had ( the ) it was all around you you had those same people offering it to you you're able to say
-	-
client.o+3	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	yeah why do you think that is
-	-
client.r+3	because it's not good for you and it's bad
client.r+d3	and i don't like it
client.r+3	it makes me feel guilty and
-	-
counselor.quo	yeah why do you think though it is ( when you're when you're as op* ) you would react differently when you're drinking as opposed to when you're not drinking
-	-
client.fn	well there's a positive and negative thing
client.fn	( there ) there's lots of things that i think of that's ( um ) i'm kind of easy ( on ) on when i'm drinking
client.fn	i like if someone comes up to me and says would you like to do this or like to do that i say yeah sure
-	-
counselor.rec	so you're more agreeable to doing ( s* ) anything suggestible when you're drinking
-	-
client.fn	yeah exactly yeah
client.o-3	so if someone comes up to me and says here would you like to smoke some of this i say yeah sure but that's if i'm really drinking
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	but when you're not drinking you think more clearly you think about ( your ) your health and ( trying to be more ) you're being more responsible but when you're drinking those things seem to disappear
-	-
client.r+1	yeah exa* yeah that's what happens
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	why do you think that is
counselor.quo	( why do you ) why do you think the alcohol has that effect
-	-
client.fn	it's just like i get into a different world
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( um ) ( it's ) it's like it's not me ( i* ) it's someone else it's someone else that's talking someone else that's smoking it
client.r+1	and ( it's ) it's like i jump into another body ( and and ) and i agree to this and agree to that and i smoke that and hang around people that i shouldn't
counselor.quo	what do you
counselor.quo	how do you feel
-	-
counselor.quo	about that
-	-
client.r+1	( uh ) i feel really guilty about that and that's why i shouldn't be drinking ( and ) and doing stuff like that
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	so you've got a lot of guilt
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah and guilt ( can make you ) makes you feel bad and about yourself
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yes it does
-	-
counselor.su	yeah that's kind of a hard thing to have to live with every day
-	-
client.fn	yeah it is
-	-
counselor.quo	what do you do to manage
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) try not to think like that
client.o+1	( uh ) and stay away from drinking and stay away from those people ( that does it ) that does that stuff
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	yeah so what do you do to stay away ( from ) from drinking
-	-
client.fn	try to occupy my time ( uh ) exercise ( um ) read walk ( um ) do something recreational
-	-
counselor.res	so you have things that you enjoy doing exercise is one
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( uh ) reading walking
counselor.res	reading
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i like to do stuff like that
-	-
counselor.rec	and when you're doing stuff like that ( you're ) you're not drinking
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	and then you're not tempted by these people who are around to use crack
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah that's true yeah
counselor.su	but it's
-	-
counselor.su	( hard ) still hard
-	-
client.fn	it is it is hard
client.r-3	and ( it it it ) i think of it the reason why i think of it when i'm not drinking is because there's a lot of people around that's still doing it and i see them and ( i s* ) i know what they're doing
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i just keep walking and i say well i don't do that stuff ( you know )
-	-
counselor.rec	right and that's challenging too when you see it when it's there in your environment and it's in your mind and it's always present and ( it's ) it's a temptation
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r-3	and i always get offered too you looking you looking
client.fn	no i'm not looking ( you know ) not looking for nothing
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
counselor.quc	where do you live
-	-
client.fn	( um ) about five blocks away
-	-
counselor.res	not far from here
client.fn	yeah
counselor.su	yeah ( that's ) that's challenging because ( it ) that type of thing is around here
-	-
client.r-3	yeah it is it's around a lot
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.af	but you're trying to do the right thing
-	-
client.o+3	yeah that's what i'm trying to get on the right ( to s* ) track and be good and try to think about my health and my family
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+n1	yeah gotta stay away from drinking ( and ) and those thoughts
-	-
counselor.quo	yeah what do you do to do that
counselor.res	you mentioned some things already
-	-
client.fn	yeah i did
-	-
counselor.quc	mm-hmm are there other things that you do or ( that's ) that you've found to be helpful
-	-
client.fn	well i meditate
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( i um ) i like to do exercise and meditate ( i i ) i read
client.fn	( i um ) i go for walks that clears my mind
client.fn	and i kinda like i have a conference with myself ( you know ) about i shouldn't do this i shouldn't do that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	how does your family fit in there
-	-
client.fn	well i have two kids and they're in montana and one is eighteen and one is sixteen and they're doing okay and they stay in touch with me
client.fn	and i do have two brothers ( and ) and a sister and a half brother
client.r+3	and when i smoke it i come home and it makes me feel out of place because i'm on drugs when i i shouldn't be on it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	you just feel kind of a responsibility to your family even though they're far away [du] an example ( or to not be on ) to not be high
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+3	yeah yeah i shouldn't be like that
client.r+3	( you know ) ( if ) if someone's looking up to me ( and i j* ) and here i'm on drugs and i shouldn't be doing that then i can't be a role model then
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so just from the little that we've talked here it sounds like it's very important for you ( to to not do ) to not drink and to not do drugs
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	alright ( um ) the other question would be how confident do you think you are that you can stop using crack and stop drinking
-	-
client.r+a3	well right now i'm really confident right now
client.r+3	because lots of things are going on with my mom and my family
-	-
counselor.res	so you're really confident
-	-
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	how about on a
-	-
counselor.quc	scale of one to ten ( like if ) if one was not at all confident and ten was the most confident ( how ) where would you fall in that
-	-
client.r+a1	i'd say nine
-	-
counselor.res	okay so that's pretty high
client.fn	right now
-	-
client.fn	right now it's nine but
counselor.rec	but
-	-
counselor.rec	but it changes
-	-
client.o-3	things may change because i think about it and the craving comes and goes
client.r+n1	( and ) and i just have to fight it
client.o+3	and i've been thinking about treatment
client.fn	but that's something that's one of my options that i might do or may or may not do
counselor.quc	where
-	-
counselor.quc	( where would ) where would you have an option for treatment
-	-
client.fn	i was thinking about thunderbird again
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i went there once before
-	-
counselor.quc	do you know how to ( get there in ) get in there
-	-
client.fn	yeah my ( um uh ) a_a counselor that's here
client.fn	( i for* ) kathleen
-	-
counselor.res	okay she could help you
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( she ) she can get me into that place
-	-
counselor.rec	and you meet with her pretty frequently
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( i'm ) i seen her yesterday and i'm gonna see her monday
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+3	yeah that's one of my options when cravings are real bad ( and ) and if something happens to my ma ( and my ) and the housing ( i ) i would definitely get into a treatment center ( and ) and take it from there [du]
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	so things would have to get worse ( you're ) you're saying for you to go into treatment
-	-
client.fn	right right
counselor.rec	you don't want them
-	-
counselor.rec	to get worse though
-	-
client.fn	no no huh-uh
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	would things have to get worse for you to go to treatment
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	why is that
counselor.quc	because they wouldn't let you in or
client.fn	because
-	-
client.fn	the housing
client.fn	( i ) if something happens to our housing it's something that i have to get into and maybe they could help me get into a place
client.fn	( or ) or if it ain't treatment i'd have to get into ( a ) a smaller place a smaller apartment
-	-
counselor.st	alright so let's go back just briefly
counselor.rec	again because it sounds like again ( it's really impor* ) this is very important to you you've got a lot of good reasons to not use drugs to stop drinking including your family your health money ( um ) just how it makes you feel about yourself ( um ) and you're pretty confident right now but you know that that can change
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	( um what would it ) what would it take ( to ) for your confidence level to be ( a ) a ten
counselor.quo	( what would ha* ) what would things look like for you
counselor.quo	how would you know that ( i'm ) i'm even more sure that i can do this or that i've done it
-	-
client.o+3	( um ) just keep thinking the way i'm doing thinking positive and ( um ) thinking about my family values ( uh my um ) my value of myself my self esteem
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+3	( my uh ) things i should have done in the past and things i should do now ( um ) things ( that i ) that i should be doing right now which is being good and being sober and staying away from drugs ( and ) and those bad thoughts
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	i wonder how much of a change ( um ) in your environment would help like if you were able to find a new area of town to live in or
client.o+3	oh yeah
-	-
client.o+3	( that that ) that could be could be
client.o-1	but ( the ) the craving would still be there ( and you know ) for drinking ( and ) and when that comes that's gonna be hard it'll be hard to beat
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+1	but from what i understand and i talked to some counselors before they say it only lasts for about ten or fifteen minutes
-	-
counselor.rec	the craving
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so it's getting through that craving
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	yeah what do you do to do that
-	-
client.fn	well my options i in the past i just gave in
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i said forget it i'm gonna do it
client.fn	and my options that i was thinking of in the past was ( um ) going for a walk exercising ( um ) that was it
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah so you know ( it's you know ) the craving is gonna come and so ( you you ) you have to be prepared when it comes and acknowledge this is what's happening i'm having this craving
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	and that can help being aware of what's happening to you ( and ) and why and then what you can do about it
-	-
counselor.rec	and it sounds like you're quite a long way there ( but the ) but that it's still a challenge
-	-
client.fn	yeah it is a challenge
-	-
counselor.rec	but you've got good support and some options
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	what do you think you're gonna do now about all this
counselor.quo	what's your plan
-	-
client.fn	well like what i was saying earlier it's very similar for what i've said
client.o+1	it's just ( uh ) stay sober and ( uh ) think positive and have my self esteem up high and be good
counselor.fa	right
client.r+1	( um ) and ( it's ) it's taken a toll on me the drinking
client.r+a1	( uh ) i can't keep doing this and it's something that i can't keep doing
client.r+1	and ( it ) it's something that's catching up to me
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+a1	and and i can't keep doing that
client.r+1	because my heart ain't that good [du] before even doing that crack my heart was bad
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	so yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	well you've got a lot of motivation there to change something
client.fn	yeah
counselor.af	yeah and i wish you the best of luck doing it
counselor.af	i think you can do it
-	-
client.fn	thank you yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	you seem pretty motivated and you've got good resources and options and a lot of good reasons

-	-
client.fn	oh no that's all right
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	i figured ( she ) she would think that i would think that i wouldn't
-	-
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
client.fn	she had already given me the gift card thing
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	i'll bet she probably thought
-	-
counselor.rec	you just going to bail huh
counselor.af	[laugh] good good well i appreciate you signing up in this study
counselor.su	and i know you had to answer a lot of questions yesterday
counselor.st	but ( um ) we're just going to have a conversation ( um ) about your use and just kind of explore that for you
-	-
counselor.gi	i'm not going to tell you what you need to do or beat you over the head with anything
counselor.gi	so it's really kind of just to help you look at the issue and see what's going on for you
-	-
counselor.gi	one of the questionnaires that you filled out chris was called the drug abuse screening test
counselor.gi	and it kind of rates ( um ) people's risk for their use on a scale from zero to one to ten
counselor.quc	and is was just wondering if you'd kind of be interested in knowing ( what ) where you placed on that
-	-
client.fn	oh what they placed me
-	-
counselor.gi	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yeah what was it
-	-
counselor.quc	okay so where do you think
counselor.st	i'll tell you what you got
counselor.quc	but where do you think
counselor.gi	you were rated at zero being no risk and ten being [du]
client.o+1	about eight
counselor.res	eight
counselor.gi	well you came out a seven so that's pretty close
counselor.gi	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.gi	so ( it's it's ) they kind of do this pyramid diagram to kind of explain or to show
counselor.gi	and yeah you were up here kind of in the severe risk category at least according to that test
client.fn	right
counselor.quo	what's that mean to you
-	-
client.fn	i mean
-	-
counselor.quc	is that how you'd see yourself too
-	-
client.o+1	( uh ) if you cross out the word drug and put alcohol i mean
-	-
counselor.fa	mm okay
-	-
client.o+1	( that ) that's my biggest that's my [du] that's what fucks me every time
counselor.res	[laugh] that's your downfall really
client.o+1	alcohol
counselor.fa	wow
client.o+1	a long period
client.r+7	i mean drugs are just a there's a stigma with drugs and they're illegal
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( um ) drugs are not ( my ) my main problem
counselor.fa	[du]
-	-
client.r+7	i think yeah ( that ) that it puts me at ( um ) risk as far as ( um you know ) situations or ( like ) going to get drugs ( you know ) i would be around people i normally wouldn't be around
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	oh okay how else do you think use whether it's drugs drugs and alcohol how do you see that putting you at risk
counselor.quo	how does that affect your life
-	-
client.r+1	yeah [du] because i just got out of the hospital
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+1	and ( there's no i mean ) there's no way if i had not been drinking that i would have mixed xanax and methadone like that
-	-
counselor.rec	oh but the alcohol just kind of caused you to not think straight and
-	-
client.fn	yeah i don't even remember getting the methadone
-	-
counselor.rec	wow so you must have woke up pretty blitzed
counselor.quo	how do you feel about all your use
-	-
client.o+1	good actually i mean i know me and i know i'm ( like ) at the end of it
client.fn	( like ) i'm saying the end of it's really difficult to explain because
counselor.quo	end of what
client.fn	all right two months ago i was diagnosed as bipolar
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i've been in twelve that's not a made up number it's not an estimate twelve in-patient rehabs and only two of those were court-ordered
counselor.quc	for [du]
client.fn	that's yeah that's because i had already been in the system alcohol and substance abuse
client.fn	( um ) i haven't been in a couple years to any ( uh ) in-patient but ( um ) saying
counselor.fa	right
counselor.res	[du] treatment programs
-	-
client.fn	yeah and i had some sobriety time ( um ) before this happened
client.fn	( uh ) my version of sobriety which is just [du] ( and i ) which is ( uh ) very good and i was doing well with that
counselor.fa	okay
client.ts-1	the other day was actually the second time i drank ( um ) after knowing that i was bipolar because i wanted to test it
-	-
client.fn	i wanted to see ( like ) in retrospect how much of everything was due to alcohol and how much of it was due to alcohol and ( the ) the manic you know i mean together
client.fn	and the first time that i ( uh ) drank out of the two ( uh ) which was a few weeks prior to this other time it was fine
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.ts-1	i went and ( bought a ) i bought a fifth
client.fn	and ( uh ) the first person i saw outside the liquor store that was out needing a drink i was like good there's somebody to cosign my bullshit you know to sit down and have a drink with you know they didn't know ( what i was ) why i was drinking
counselor.fa	hmm
-	-
client.fn	i was just drinking to see if i could drink and stop and i did
client.fn	i was like okay cool and i didn't think much of it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( uh ) since i've been on the lithium the bipolar medication i've been a lot more rational in my decision making and stuff
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and then ( this uh ) this past time it was weird i was eating the xanaxes first
client.fn	and then i don't know my roommate told me later on that i got some liquor and then i guess that's when the methadone
-	-
counselor.rec	and you don't really remember any of that
-	-
client.fn	no i was in blackout i don't [du]
-	-
counselor.quc	had you had blackouts before
client.r+1	[du]
-	-
client.r+1	but apparently i almost died
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	what's that mean to you
counselor.quo	how do you feel about that
-	-
client.r+1	it's like again [laugh]
client.fn	i mean ( it's not i have ) i don't know my past is just i mean speckled with all kinds of stuff like that
client.fn	( and ) and it really has honest to god slowed down a lot
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i just moved here ( like ) a year and a half ago
-	-
client.fn	i know i'm doing doing better
client.fn	i mean oh i don't know you would have had to have known me for a long time get a better picture i mean
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	what it sounds like ( as you're ) as you're talking that life was really fucked up before
-	-
client.fn	well it was
-	-
counselor.rec	and now it's not quite so bad
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.res	you said you've had blackouts before so you're kind of like eh that's just what happens
counselor.quc	( um ) they don't scare you anymore
counselor.quc	or are you concerned that if you continue to drink you'll black out and again take stuff that you're not even really being aware you're taking
-	-
client.r+1	other people worry me that's what worries me
-	-
counselor.quo	how
-	-
client.r+1	i mean you're vulnerable when you're in a blackout state
client.r+1	i mean some people could as far as being robbed or whatever
-	-
counselor.res	okay so that's one concern about if you're having blackouts
-	-
client.r+1	and getting hurt i mean
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	you could be robbed or hurt or maybe given stuff that you don't know that you're actually taking
client.r+1	yeah
counselor.quo	what's this like for you now you and i sitting here talking about this
-	-
client.fn	it's all right
client.fn	i got a buzz so i mean i [du] alcohol thing
client.fn	but i'm still on pain medication so
-	-
counselor.quc	so the buzz is from the meds not from alcohol or anything
-	-
client.r+1	no i mean i can't physically drink i don't even know why i attempt to drink anymore i've got hepatitis_c i've had it for a while ( uh )
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
counselor.quo	mm-hmm why do you think you continue to drink
-	-
client.o+1	i don't know because i really i don't know
-	-
counselor.st	let me veer away from drugs and alcohol for a minute
counselor.res	( you know ) you've alluded to kind of your past is speckled with all kinds of shit going down
counselor.res	and you've got hep_c and you've been diagnosed bipolar
counselor.rec	and i kind of get this sense
counselor.gi	and tell me if i'm off base
counselor.rec	kind of get this sense that life just kind of sucks
counselor.quo	what do you want different for your life
-	-
client.fn	i just i wish my i don't know
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	more money really [laugh]
-	-
counselor.gi	well we'd all like that one
-	-
client.fn	just ( uh ) i don't know i'd like to be able ( to rely on ) to have some reliable source of happiness
-	-
counselor.quo	what do you think would give you that
-	-
client.fn	i really don't have any friends up here
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	or a relationship which ( i ) i mean i'm not at my best i'm not a very good representative of myself right now
counselor.su	i understand that
client.fn	i want to have my own stuff together but
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.quo	what would help you get it together
counselor.quo	or what is it you need to get together
-	-
client.fn	basically money
client.fn	( i have uh ) i'm ( like ) this close to getting my license back
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	which i lost it when i was eighteen i'm thirty i'll be thirty_one in a couple months
client.fn	( um ) and i was eligible to get it back a year after i lost it so that shows you where it was on the priority list
client.fn	but in retrospect it's probably ( it's ) good that i haven't had a license
-	-
client.fn	we probably wouldn't be having this conversation
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+1	that weighs on my mind a lot too
client.r+1	( like there's not ) there is no craving for a drink or any of that anymore that's way gone now
client.r-1	( it's just like ) when i do drink it's just ( like ) very spontaneous just like f it like f attitude
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+1	( um ) that's kind of what scares me it's just a [du] give up you know and ( i )
client.r+1	i don't want to be drinking with my license
client.o+1	( it's ) i'm almost to the point where i thought about just saying fuck it
-	-
client.o+1	just get a doctor to prescribe me antabuse
client.o+1	i mean that would prevent it right there you know
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-1	( i can't i mean you can't ) because like i said i've been in and out and in and out of a_a and it just doesn't do anymore
client.r-1	i've seen a_a change
-	-
client.fn	i mean i'm not even that old but ( i ) i started coming in when i was sixteen or seventeen
client.r-1	and i've seen it change in the sense that people don't take this seriously and a lot of people are court-ordered which if you've got a room full of people that don't want to be there i mean that doesn't make for a good conversation and it's got a high recidivism rate
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r-1	( and i you know ) and a lot of the things that i do like smoking weed which does not agree with them
client.r-1	( you know ) and i just ( uh ) i don't know i feel like half the time ( i ) i just find myself going to meetings like arguing or not arguing ( but ) because usually i don't say anything but just like if i would i would be ( you know ) not agreeing with anybody else
-	-
counselor.quc	so when you talked about going to treatment twelve times you were talking about a_a
counselor.quc	or you were talking about in-patient treatment
client.fn	oh no in-patient treatment
counselor.fa	ah
-	-
client.fn	i've been to hundreds and hundreds of meetings [laugh]
-	-
counselor.res	but it sounds like that doesn't do it for you anymore
-	-
client.fn	[du] i was one of those people i never made it past ( like ) right around thirty days ( i would ) i would relapse
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	i don't know why ( i don't know if a_a you know ) i haven't been in a a_a meeting in a couple of years i don't think well no i've been within a couple of years but i haven't been ( like ) active
-	-
counselor.res	going regularly
counselor.st	so chris i want to come back to this point you raised a while ago
counselor.gi	because i think it affects or is connected to your decisions to use whatever it is you're going to use
counselor.rec	you said part of you has this oh just fuck it attitude
-	-
counselor.rec	just do whatever i want to hell with it i don't care and then on the other hand there's a part of you that says chris don't give up this could be better it's kind of like you're caught between those two
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	i'd say inner conflict definitely
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	( what do you ) what do you need
counselor.quo	if it's kind of like a teeter totter ( you know ) [du] what do you need on the side where it says don't give up
client.fn	on the good side
counselor.quo	what would help
-	-
client.fn	i don't know because i feel guilty a lot i always [du] i need ( like ) more illusion in my life and stuff
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i'm like no because that never you know i mean i do i pray and all that i believe in god
client.r+1	i kind of feel like ( this ) what just happened was ( like ) kind of like punishment
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
counselor.rec	somebody kind of coming down and slopping you on the head
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+1	yeah i mean it ( may ) may very well be i don't know
-	-
client.fn	who's to say
-	-
counselor.quc	if you were standing on that teeter totter are you in the middle
counselor.quc	are you on one end
counselor.quc	more toward one end or the other
counselor.quc	or just off center
counselor.quc	( or are you
counselor.quc	) where are you
-	-
client.o+1	i mean i think i always have leaned more on the hope side because i'm still here and
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	that's what i'm seeing too i feel like you're kind of stepping toward that and yet part of you feels like oh i don't know what's going to happen can i trust myself ( can i ) can i stay on this side ( of the ) of center
-	-
client.r+1	yeah ( that's i ) i don't trust myself
client.r-1	i do
client.r+1	but i don't know things can just get out of hand
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+1	( like ) i mean everything was going fine the other day ( and ) and i come to and i'm in the hospital and my roommate's there and my whole left side was numb
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.r+1	i thought i had a stroke i was in there for nine days now i've got [du] and stuff on the left side
counselor.fa	wow
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+1	i kind of feel like that's why i kind of feel like it was specific punishment because my left side was already weak ( you know ) i worked on getting it back
-	-
client.fn	( it was ) it was a normal day ( since i ) since the bipolar revelation there a couple months ago
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) i've been working off all these fines i mean i still had ( like ) underage drinking tickets to pay off ( like ) ten year old fines
-	-
client.fn	and i've got it down now from like twenty_two hundred to ( it's ) about six_hundred now
client.fn	( which was ) i was like wow you know i just mailed off like sixteen_hundred bucks in a month and a half or two months and that's working through the labor hall
client.fn	you know i was doing fine
-	-
client.fn	( i mean i wasn't
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	) i mean i smoked weed so it wasn't like i had a whole bunch of bottled up sobriety that i had to let go of
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	i mean on a daily ( you know ) i'd get high enjoy that part of my day
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( um ) but i went to the labor hall and i don't know i had planned on working and there wasn't any work
-	-
client.fn	and i was like well what am i going to do
client.ts-7	( uh ) i got some xanaxes
client.fn	and then it's weird because it's usually alcohol first if i'm going to drink
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i don't know
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.quc	do you remember what you were thinking at the time when you went and you couldn't get work
client.fn	no
-	-
client.fn	i don't remember going to get the liquor as a matter of fact
-	-
counselor.fa	wow okay
-	-
client.fn	i mean i vaguely remember it now that my roommate told me what time of day it was and stuff
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i thought okay yeah maybe remember it but it just ( you know ) the days before and after they kind of blended in with it you know
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r+1	i mean that scares me because i it just shows me ( how ) once again how fragile life is
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	when you say you smoke weed daily i mean do you get wasted on that
counselor.quc	or are you smoking several times a day or
-	-
client.r-2	i mean it would be impossible for me to get wasted on weed
client.fn	but i actually i haven't smoked in ( like ) a day or two but ( uh )
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.quo	so when you regularly smoke
-	-
client.o-2	( just uh ) just a little bit here and there
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-2	just something to amuse my thoughts basically
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.fa	so
-	-
client.o-2	i mean we're talking like ten dollars spread out throughout the day
client.o-2	i go down and spread it ( you know ) a couple joints or something by myself light it up and go on about my business
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	and i'm fine with that i mean you know go to work they're none the wiser
-	-
counselor.quo	what about the other drugs that you take off and on the methadone the [du]
client.fn	that actually the
-	-
client.fn	it wasn't the first time i was taking methadone but the first time i've taken it like that
client.fn	and i don't remember getting it because it was a pill form
-	-
counselor.quc	mm-hmm do you take those kinds of things regularly if you can get it or find it
counselor.quc	or was that just kind of the
-	-
client.fn	if i have the excess money which is not very often
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	then you'll get some
-	-
client.fn	yeah usually i've used xanax a couple times
-	-
counselor.quo	what are you looking for when you take that whatever it is
-	-
client.r-7	( um ) just a more relaxed feeling
client.r+7	but i've even noticed with ( the ) the lithium on the bipolar ( most like ) i'm doing it now ( just to ) just because i was used to doing it
client.r+1	i mean ( it ) the lithium really has yeah
counselor.rec	relaxed you
-	-
counselor.rec	so you don't need the other stuff as much you're not looking for that okay
client.r+n1	right
-	-
client.r-1	now more than anything it's just i think boredom i don't know
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r-1	because the ( um ) [cough] excuse me [cough] apparently i've been self-medicating with the alcohol and i can see where it did help
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+1	and then now that i've been diagnosed with it i can see where of all this stuff it's really just being bipolar but the drunkenness covered it up
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	right
client.r+1	( you know ) normal people don't drink and go do that
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so what i what i'm hearing in all this is i like to smoke weed i kind of do that on a daily basis the other drugs the xanax or the methadone or whatever else it is i don't do that regularly and i'm not looking for it maybe if i have excess money or boredom ( i ) but it's not kind of your [du] substance
client.fn	right right
-	-
counselor.rec	but the alcohol is kind of the trigger that fucks everything up that if you drink it's kind all bets are off you don't always know what's going to happen or what you're going to do or and that it ( um ) if you've got hep c though it's causing you more problems you've got blackouts that you've lost days and time and you don't know kind of what you're doing and it makes you more vulnerable somebody could beat you up or rob you or give you something that you don't know what it is you're taking
client.r+1	yeah
client.r+1	yeah
-	-
counselor.adp	and i'm wondering if ( you know ) approaching this not an all or nothing
counselor.res	kind of like you said sobriety the way i define it
counselor.adp	if you can think about is there a way that you can modify change maybe stop i don't know if that's something you're interested in the alcohol
-	-
client.r+d1	oh yeah by all means ( i don't ) i want nothing to do with alcohol really
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-d1	i mean i love it i've loved it for so long i just
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	but it sounds like ( you know ) you weren't even thinking about it and the next thing you knew you had bought a fifth
counselor.quo	what is it that you think would help you ( to say ) and when those moments come up say no i can't do that
-	-
client.fn	antabuse i mean literally i couldn't do it i don't know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	do you feel like you can stop drinking without antabuse
counselor.res	you say now i don't want to
client.fn	i mean
-	-
client.fn	i'm not drinking now
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+1	( i ) the spontaneity of it all ( i just i don't ) that's what scares me um
counselor.gi	[du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.st	so let's key in on that
counselor.gi	because what i'm trying help you figure out what will help you get to where you want to be
counselor.rec	you kind of talk about i don't want to drink and yet there's this spontaneity that occurs when the next thing i know i've got a fifth in my hand
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.su	i know sometimes things seem like they just occur and all of a sudden we're doing something and we don't know how we got there
client.fn	right
counselor.gi	but i think sometimes there are some steps some thought processes that get us there
client.fn	oh yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	and so i think this spontaneity thing seems to be the key for you around the alcohol
counselor.adp	and so if it's like well maybe i'll just go get a fifth it's being able to kind of recognize that that thought comes up and being able to say okay let me think through do i really want to do that what am i going to get from it what's it going to cost me
-	-
counselor.gi	and i don't mean money i mean what's it going to cost me to do that
counselor.adp	and is there another way i can in other words give yourself ( you know ) that old count to ten before you act kind of thing
client.o+1	yeah
counselor.gi	because that kind of thing you allow yourself to kind of think through things to see is that really what i want to do
counselor.quc	have you ever done anything like that
-	-
client.fn	i mean the lithium helps with that
client.fn	what are you talking about ( like ) slowing down and counting
counselor.gi	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah i mean i've played it through before
client.fn	and ( uh ) because there are a lot of times when that comes up like the other day there's more times that come up where i don't drink than when i do
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
client.fn	i mean that comes up a lot in my mind
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm so you're doing that already that kind of evaluation process that thinking it through
-	-
client.fn	right i mean ( it's ) it comes up from time to time
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+1	( i you know ) nine times out of ten i'll say no
counselor.af	wow okay
client.r+1	but i mean it's really ( like ) life or death it's really not
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm so you're at the point that you really do need to start making some changes here
-	-
client.r+1	[du] i mean if i drink for two or three days straight i can't physically stop see shit coming out of the walls and going to d_ts
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	sure
client.r+1	have a seizure ( uh ) i've had six seizures because of that and that's what scares me
client.r+1	because i know i know how people are and i know how people think and i know how like i could end up in jail hypothetically
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i don't look right now like somebody that would go through d_ts if i was drinking and stopped
client.r+1	so they're going to play that shit off in jail and i could die in a jail cell or something you know
counselor.rec	[du]
-	-
counselor.rec	not knowing what you're really going through
-	-
client.fn	exactly
-	-
counselor.su	gees that's kind of scary
-	-
counselor.gi	( i ) i kind of come back to that teeter totter that balance thing and trying to help you kind of think through what are the things that you need to help keep moving you toward that don't give up side
counselor.res	and part of that sounds like giving yourself that time to evaluate and think through things before you make the decision so you're not just acting kind of on the spur of the moment
counselor.quo	what else would you need
-	-
client.o+1	i mean i think it would help ( you know ) maybe if i was in a relationship or something you know maybe that would help
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+1	at least i'd have somebody to tell me no
counselor.res	somebody
counselor.fa	exactly
client.fn	i don't know
-	-
counselor.res	you said you don't
-	-
client.o+1	( i don't ) i mean that's kind of far-fetched because i know me and if i'm going to do something i'm going to do it anyway screw it yeah
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	you talked about needing ( well i this sense of um ) maybe getting some friends and developing some kind of support
-	-
client.fn	that's the hard part because i'm not
-	-
client.o+1	it seems like i guess in making friends ( like ) there's a whole bunch of people out there that would be great friends that wouldn't want me to drink and i can hang out with
client.o-1	but it's almost like they're a little bit too good or too goody-two-shoes because i still i still smoke weed and ( you know ) it's like i couldn't really fit in with them
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+1	and i don't want to hang out with the damn all-out junkies ( you know ) and alcoholics
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	so it's kind of like ( where ) where do i fit you know where do i i guess there's not a whole lot of i don't know i mean
counselor.res	i hear that
-	-
client.fn	the majority of the past year has been sober
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( but it's you know ) i was doing a lot of healthy things ( you know ) going to the y all the time running and stuff
counselor.fa	really
client.fn	and ( uh ) i've made a bunch of lifestyle changes and
-	-
counselor.quc	and you keep those going or reconnect with those
-	-
client.r-1	i can i mean i could ( but um ) but it's lonely because i'm doing all that stuff alone you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	the other thing i hear is ( like ) with the friends well they're almost too good for me ( because i'm not ) or i'm not as good as they are because i still would want to smoke weed
counselor.gi	it's kind of an all or nothing view of how you see things
counselor.adp	i think realizing nobody's perfect and those people that you think are ( you know ) too good for you they probably have their issues too
-	-
counselor.adp	and it's being able to kind of develop friendships
counselor.gi	and maybe you won't get everything from one person but you can get some kind of support from one person and something from somebody else
counselor.rec	it's almost like you've kind of cut yourself off from even trying because well i'm not quite like the
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.adp	well it might be a if you can kind of say well i may not be quite like them but i'm not that different either
client.fn	i think it's self-esteem
counselor.rec	yeah you know i hear you saying i need to move toward that don't give up side more and i know that one of the things is i need to stop the alcohol because that really gets things fucked up big time
-	-
counselor.af	and that you've made some strides in that
counselor.res	as you said nine times out of the ten ( i'm not able ) i'm able to not use the
client.fn	right
counselor.adp	i think looking at what else would help you keep that you know
counselor.adp	is it broadening your friendship network so that you don't get bored and have people to hang out and do things with and talk with
-	-
counselor.adp	( you know ) is reconnecting with a_a or something like that even though you may not get everything again out of that is that something that would help
counselor.gi	i don't know
counselor.gi	but looking at what would kind of help shore you up and assist you
counselor.adp	( um ) you talked about antabuse and i know you've had a somewhat jokingly somewhat serious but is that something that ( you know ) you'd want to talk to your doctor about
-	-
counselor.su	( um ) but looking at ( you know ) you've been through a hell of a lot in your life at this point and there may be lots of reasons why you've been in the places and done the things that you've done
counselor.rec	but you're at this point and i hear you saying this has to change
-	-
counselor.rec	otherwise i'm going to ( you know ) next time i might not come out of it
-	-
client.r+1	i don't know the drinking i don't know if i've got another recovery
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+1	i was nine days i don't know what it was called grabdomyalisis [err] or something it's just when your body's ( like ) you know how ( like ) when you're asleep on a certain side for too long or something ( like ) it was like that but just to a more serious degree
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	wow
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.rec	and so ( you know ) you're saying this is kind of getting scared about this
counselor.af	i believe that you can keep taking those steps toward the hope end of the spectrum
counselor.su	( you know ) we all have that sometimes fuck it attitude like i'm not worth it or i can't do it or it's not worth it or whatever it is
-	-
counselor.adp	but ( there ) i think it's important to kind of remember that i do want to live i do want to have a life i do
counselor.af	as you said i thought it was a wonderful way you said it
counselor.res	i want kind of this reliable presence of happiness
counselor.adp	i think being able to think about well what can i do to take some steps because we do have to take the steps
-	-
counselor.adp	steps don't come to us what can we do to help move ourselves toward that even if we don't do it perfectly ( you know ) even if it doesn't always work out
client.fn	right
-	-
client.o+1	a lot of it is me not not doing [du] doing
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.su	well and that's not to say ( you know ) you're a terrible person or beating yourself up
counselor.gi	it's like okay here's a pattern that i've gotten into but i know i can change the pattern
counselor.af	you've changed the pattern already
counselor.res	and you said
counselor.gi	which i think is a really important awareness
counselor.rec	that the lithium has already kind of calmed you down so a lot of the reasons you were using drugs and alcohol to relax to escape to whatever that dynamic that feeling inside you has already changed
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.adp	it's just kind of being able to curb in that alcohol use that sends you over the edge sometimes
-	-
client.fn	even before the lithium ( it was ) my drinking was very ( like ) not often
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i mean ( i wasn't ) over the past couple years ( it's ) it's just been ( like ) dwindling
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+1	but when i have it's been a lot yeah and it's like near death shit every time ends in the hospital every time i'm in the hospital
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
client.r+1	april the twelfth ended in the hospital
client.fn	university_of_washington now i have that in my file
client.fn	( that ) that would be a good one for you to look into as far as my behavior
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	because ( uh ) i was on the bus just i don't know
client.r+1	i think a lot of it is psychiatric stuff
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	i was on the bus i came to i was in four point restraint
counselor.su	oh my
client.fn	and they were like it was three in the morning and i had been in for eight hours i didn't know that
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	and i called my mom this was in april this was the last time i talked to her
-	-
client.fn	i said did i leave a message the other day just hoping that i hadn't called
client.fn	and she was like chris you called five times in a row and she could tell she was like you sounded fine when you first started talking
client.fn	i was on the redmond bus coming back and i was drinking
client.fn	and she said you just you said something i'm getting off this bus to pee now
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	the bus hadn't stopped
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+1	and apparently i just said something to ( like ) a whole bunch of people ( and just ) like my thoughts on or my delusions on how i felt about seattle she ( you know ) money and people that had more than me and shit
counselor.fa	wow
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	i hung up the phone apparently i don't know
client.r+1	i guess i did some* they ( called ) must have called the transit police that's how i woke up in a hospital chair
counselor.fa	right hmm
-	-
client.fn	( a lot of ) i don't know there's a lot of shit that's going to be with me for a long time
client.fn	i mean like i said i just moved here what a year and a half ago but you wouldn't even recognize me before that
client.fn	( um ) [cough] half my townies was incarcerated
-	-
client.fn	( like ) literally half almost five years spread out
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	sure
client.fn	and ( uh ) most of the other time was spent homeless
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	and not clean homeless i mean i couldn't hold my own battles homeless like shit tracks in my pants homeless ( uh ) drinking listerine homeless
counselor.res	on the ground
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
client.fn	yeah i had to get going it was bad
client.fn	( and i ) but i'm starting to get things back get my shit together
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and now that i've found out that i'm bipolar i kind of resent it
-	-
client.fn	i resent my family i resent fucking everybody
client.fn	because i feel like somebody could have said uh can we help this guy fuck you know instead of just letting me continue on
client.fn	now i just ( i want nothing to do with ) want nothing to do with my family period
counselor.fa	sure
-	-
client.fn	honestly i'm kind of pissed about this last incident
client.fn	( if i would ) at least if i would have been back home i would fucking went to jail you know i mean it would've woke me up i wouldn't have gotten rabdomyalisis [err] from laying on
client.fn	i mean [du] suckers know of human nature up here
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	but there is as you know
client.fn	( it's just my ) i can't really rely on my thoughts because hell ( i've ) i'm just now getting back down to earth
counselor.gi	well you know
client.fn	at least ( i don't know ) i'm smart enough to know that i don't know what the fuck i'm talking about [laugh]
client.fn	does that make any sense
counselor.gi	well you know it
-	-
counselor.gi	it does make sense it does indeed
counselor.af	and ( you know ) chris i am truly amazed
counselor.gi	and ( i don't just ) i'm not just blowing smoke
counselor.res	you talk about being homeless and shit in your pants homeless to where you are today
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	you've made major strides
client.fn	that's right
counselor.su	and i think you can continue to make those i know it's hard but i think you can continue to move toward that hope into the spectrum
-	-
counselor.rec	the other thing that ( i'm ) occurs to me is it sounds like you've got a lot of ( you know ) thoughts and feelings that you haven't really been able to deal with too much
counselor.adp	have you thought about ever considered doing any counseling or therapy does that help at all
-	-
client.fn	yeah i'm already doing that yeah sure
counselor.fa	are you
counselor.af	okay great
-	-
counselor.af	well i really want to encourage you to maintain that and keep with it
counselor.gi	because that will help too
client.fn	it's just about over
-	-
client.fn	because ( they're um ) it's crisis intervention
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	it's only supposed to last two months and i've been on it ( like ) five or six and this is my second go-around
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	because they had me on antidepressants at first
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	it's not their fault
counselor.gi	no
counselor.gi	well maybe
client.fn	like last year because ( i you know ) i had thought [du] a few times when people told me that
client.fn	( um ) but august seventeenth of last year i checked in to harborview for alcohol withdrawals and they kept me for a week then
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	i mean that's [du] that's pretty much august seventeenth of last year i consider that to a degree a sobriety day kind of because that's kind of when i became unhomeless too
counselor.fa	sure
counselor.rec	turning point
-	-
counselor.gi	well and you
client.fn	and somebody just found me by the grace of god i mean literally i was in the park shaking
counselor.su	oh my
client.fn	and somebody that used to be homeless saw me and was like come on i'll get you a six pack whatever you [du]
counselor.rec	saw you
-	-
client.fn	you know i mean at that point there's nothing you can do but drink more you know
client.fn	and then after a few days come by their house ( you know ) they said well if you can if you want to go to harborview and they spoke for me on my behalf
-	-
counselor.af	well that's nice of them
client.fn	i've lived with [du]
counselor.res	well it sounds like even if the crisis intervention program ends they may be able to get you connected to something hopefully more ongoing
counselor.quo	what's ( this ) our discussion today been like for you how do you feel about that
-	-
client.fn	it's been positive i mean ( been a good um ) i'm getting a lot of good feedback i appreciate the positive feedback
-	-
counselor.st	well what i'd like to do is give you a call in about a week or so just to touch base won't be a long conversation
counselor.gi	but just to ( uh ) kind of see how you're doing and seeing if anything from today's conversation has come up or stuck with you or anything that ( you know ) any other changes that you might want to make
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) you can have this if you'd like
counselor.gi	and this is a list of treatment resources that you may already know a lot about
counselor.gi	and if you want that you can have that too okay
counselor.st	( um ) you've already got your card so ( um ) i'll give you a call in about a week
-	-
counselor.nc	okay it looks like it's working clark
counselor.af	alright so thanks again for joining us on ( this uh ) this study it's helpful to get as much help with this as we can
client.fn	it
-	-
client.fn	is possible yes
-	-
counselor.quc	( do are you uh a*
counselor.res	) and so it ( went ) went okay out there taking ( the um ) the dast
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	[du]
counselor.quc	( the da* ) are you familiar with the dast at all
-	-
client.fn	is that drug ( uh ) alcohol_screening ( uh ) whatever [du]
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah basically ( drug al* ) drug_abuse_screening_test
client.fn	right
counselor.gi	yeah it was the ( ten ) ten ( um ) question survey
client.fn	[du] right
-	-
client.fn	yeah like the nast [du] yeah
-	-
counselor.af	very good
counselor.gi	yeah and so ( uh ) ( it ) it scores you from one to ten ( um ) measuring risk from substance use
client.fn	[du]
counselor.gi	okay you scored a three
counselor.gi	that ( uh ) was on this test basically meaning you incur moderate risk from substance use
counselor.quc	does that sound about right or
client.fn	because
-	-
client.r+1	i shouldn't drink at all because i have ( uh ) hep c and cirrhosis
client.o-1	so yeah if it wasn't for that there wouldn't be any risk that i would be taking
counselor.fa	oh okay
counselor.res	be any at all
client.o-1	because i don't drink to excess
client.r+1	but drinking one beer is drinking to excess when you have hep c
counselor.res	have hep c
-	-
counselor.quo	( what about the uh ) and then also the medical marijuana and mushrooms
-	-
client.fn	oh i did mushrooms once this ( uh you know )
client.fn	i yeah well i mean i've done mushrooms before but it's been three years since i did mushrooms
counselor.res	just once
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-d7	when mushrooms come around in the fall ( you know ) i've always liked to do them in a little harmless substance yeah
-	-
client.r-7	so i won't get addicted to it it's not physically addicting
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+7	i could pick the wrong kind of mushroom and could end up dead
client.r-7	but since i was a harm reduction counselor and i helped people to make sure that they didn't pick the wrong ones i'm pretty sure that ( uh ) i'm
counselor.gi	then it's
-	-
counselor.res	you can pick them out
client.r-7	safe
-	-
client.r-7	yes i studied ( uh ) books and everything else
counselor.fa	okay [du]
client.fn	because i'm teaching other people about harm reduction and about ( you know ) if they're gonna use needles i would try to do it more safely and ( you know ) not share anything not even cottons ( not not ) not works not nothing but yeah
-	-
counselor.res	so you feel pretty confident about picking out the shrooms so to speak
client.fn	yes
client.r-7	absolutely
counselor.quc	( uh ) anything else about mushrooms that would concern you
counselor.quc	( if a* ) anything along the lines of the effects that conseque*
client.o-7	no
-	-
counselor.res	no
client.o-7	just very mild hallucinations very very mild hallucinations
client.fn	because i when i was younger i used to love doing l_s_d and stuff when i was ( uh ) back in the day when the counterculture was around
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( you know ) i was a part of the counterculture you could say
-	-
counselor.quo	oh okay ( tell ) tell me more about that clark
counselor.quc	back in the what sixties
-	-
client.fn	yeah late sixties
client.fn	( i was ) i graduated from high school in sixty_eight
client.fn	and ( uh ) traveled down to ( uh uh um ) greenwich_village like ( uh ) every other weekend go down to the hippie spot ( you know )
client.fn	and all the weird people and stuff
client.fn	( and ) and it was my desire to fly out to california and go to haight-ashbury and hitchhike down the highway one coast from san_francisco down to l_a
counselor.fa	ahh
client.fn	and i did all that when i was ( uh ) just eighteen years old and ( uh ) yeah
-	-
client.fn	and it was ( a ) a great fun time
client.fn	( uh ) and drugs only became a problem when i did a drug that i said i'd never do and i said i'd never do heroin
counselor.fa	ahh
counselor.res	then it became a problem
client.r+4	and yeah because that will become a problem for anybody because it physically addicts you
counselor.res	so
-	-
counselor.res	and so ( you ) you got addicted to heroin
-	-
client.fn	yeah for six months
client.fn	and then i quit for thirteen years or so
client.fn	it was then i didn't tell myself i could never do it again
client.fn	i made an agreement with myself that if i was traveling around the country and i knew i wasn't gonna be there the next day and somebody came across and had some i'd do it
-	-
client.fn	and i did that for thirteen years without ever becoming addicted again
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but then i broke my rule okay and i got it from somebody who i knew who lived in the area where i was
client.r+4	and yeah ( you know ) you slowly start to slide back into using again until you're addicted
client.r+4	and ( then you're ) then you have to keep on using or deal with the pain and [du] psychological misery and stuff yeah
counselor.rec	( what hap* ) what happens afterward
-	-
counselor.quc	so how long then ( were did you ) were you ( lu* ) using the cocaine after that then
-	-
client.fn	the what
-	-
counselor.quc	( the c* ) was it cocaine
-	-
client.fn	no heroin
-	-
counselor.gi	i mean sorry i mean the heroin
counselor.gi	after the thirteen years
-	-
client.fn	( um ) probably from nineteen_eighty_three to about ( uh ) ninety when i was in ( uh ) methadone treatment for the last time
-	-
counselor.res	so ( you ) you went into methadone treatment after that spread
client.fn	i was in methadone
-	-
client.fn	treatment three different times over the eighties when i was using
client.fn	for the seven years that i was using
counselor.fa	oh i see
counselor.res	oh so in and out
client.r+4	i quit numerous ( uh ) times because ( i never ) whenever i got up to using sixty dollars a day that was too expensive for me
counselor.res	numerous times
client.r+4	i had three kids and ( uh uh ) taking care of them and the rent and food and everything came first before my habit
client.r+4	and when my habit started getting so bad that it was taking more money than it should then i'd kick
-	-
counselor.rec	so that was it that was the main
-	-
client.r+4	yeah because i have to support my family and that was more important to me ( than ) than my addiction
counselor.rec	factor
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	so ( that's what um ) that's what helped you lick ( the ) the heroin after that stretch of ( uh ) methadone treatment
client.fn	well that but
-	-
client.fn	my mother was dying with cancer and ( i was um ) i was down to about oh [sigh] fifteen milligrams from about sixty
client.fn	and ( uh ) i was taking care of her while she was her last days and her last breaths
client.r+4	( and uh ) and ( uh ) yeah she just said ( you know ) ( i uh ) a deathbed wish ( you know i ) i wish you could just promise me that you could stay off of drugs and everything else and it's unfair god promised me ( that ) that i wouldn't die without seeing you being successful in your life ( and )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+4	and then couple weeks later she said it's okay i can die now she had a big smile on her face and she said god showed me you in the future and everything that i prayed for ( uh ) god gave to me so i can die now
client.fn	and she died a couple days later yeah
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
client.fn	not before the day before she died she ( was ) had her hands up and she said can you see the light can you see it yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	and so no heroin since
-	-
client.fn	well ( uh ) probably ( uh ) twice
client.fn	( uh ) once my mother died in ninety_one and i went to prison in ninety_two for five years
client.fn	and ( uh um ) i did it once before i went to prison and i did it twice after i got out of prison back in ninety_five
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i haven't used ( uh ) heroin for way over ten year ten years
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	no excuse me
-	-
counselor.quc	since that time
client.fn	mm
-	-
client.fn	yeah about ten years around ten years
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah it's been about ten years so
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quo	and what's kept you on ( the ) the straight and narrow in that regard
-	-
client.r+4	( uh ) well number one my promising my mother
client.r+4	number two i ( uh ) became a chemical dependency counselor [laugh] so ( uh ) i understood all about ( uh ) the problem
client.fn	and ( uh ) my way of belief is that it was a maladaptive coping strategy that i used ( to ) to deal with pain and stress
-	-
client.fn	( and um ) and ( uh ) you can learn of new ways of coping with things and ( uh you know i uh i ) i meditate
client.fn	( i uh ) i ( uh ) use ( uh ) [sigh] well you breathe and you try to empty yourself of everything you feel so you can become more sensitive to your body and what it's saying to you and everything else ( uh uh ) what's the name of the
-	-
counselor.quc	( i ) is it yoga
-	-
client.fn	it's a type of ( uh ) it's not really
client.fn	it's been it's been used ( uh ) for depression
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	okay and ( it's ) they recently alan marlatt has been ( uh ) doing some things ( with uh ) with it with substance abuse
client.fn	and ( uh ) they did a thing ( up at ) when they had nrf ( uh ) which is the county's ( uh uh ) jail drug program thing
-	-
client.fn	and ( uh they ) you go into a retreat for like ten days and for like ten days you don't talk and you sit on the mat and i don't know what else you do [laugh]
-	-
counselor.rec	but you find that helpful [du]
client.fn	more than a
client.fn	no i don't do
-	-
client.fn	not that that's a little radical for me
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.res	( that's the )
-	-
counselor.res	( that's the ) that's the ( um ) hardcore version of what you're talking about
client.fn	[nvv] but
-	-
client.fn	vipasana something like that
client.fn	vipasana or something like that
counselor.gi	okay okay i'm not
-	-
counselor.gi	familiar but
client.fn	[du]
counselor.rec	basically you've found ways to relax other outside of ( uh )
client.fn	yeah and also
-	-
client.r+4	and also by using cognitive behavioral therapy on myself and looking at ( a ) a situation and thinking that there's other ways of looking at it than the way i'm looking at it and other ways might not cause me the kind of stress or anger or stuff that i'm feeling and so why automatically ( you know ) run to the negative thought
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( uh ) and so yeah
counselor.rec	insight
counselor.rec	you have that insight
-	-
client.fn	( i taught ) that was one of the things i taught people
client.fn	so ( um ) anything i taught people i of course taught myself so

counselor.quo	( through ) through
-	-
client.fn	doctor_merrill my doctor here ( uh ) wrote it for me wrote a prescription
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.res	[du]
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so ( your you ) your concern the three that you scored is basically around the alcohol
-	-
client.r+1	yeah because i shouldn't be drinking
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	mm okay
client.fn	( you know um ) and so yeah and ( sometimes you know ) sometimes i don't drink for ten twelve days
counselor.rec	but you know that yeah
client.fn	and ( you know ) i'm going through a divorce right now okay yeah
counselor.su	oh are you i'm sorry
client.fn	and ( uh losing ) losing my mobile home and losing pretty much everything ( uh ) that i own
counselor.gi	that's
-	-
client.fn	had ( uh ) my driver's license taken away because of a accident i had been in where i got my head run over and actually this guy was at fault
client.fn	( uh ) but ( uh ) without a lawyer and he had a lawyer and i was going through chemo at the time and i could hardly even sit in the court
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i asked the judge please not now and she said it's been going on for a year and you knew what you were doing before so you can't tell me you don't know what you're doing now
-	-
client.fn	( it's just ) i can barely think now i had to drop out of graduate school
client.fn	okay she didn't want to hear it
client.fn	so ( um ) two years after the judgment ( uh ) they finally send me a letter saying they're taking my ( uh ) driving privileges away
client.fn	and yeah i found out i can't even get temporary ( uh ) privileges
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	( uh ) for going to the hospital and back
-	-
client.fn	so i offered ( the ) them fifty dollars and told them they could get fifty dollars a month and i owe them something like fourteen thousand
client.fn	( uh ) but i said i get ( uh ) six_hundred_and_eighty_eight dollars a month ( uh ) s_s_i and that's all i get
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and giving you fifty dollars is ( uh ) hard okay ( so ) but i'll give you fifty dollars a month if you write in and tell them that you're satisfied with our arrangement and i can get my driver's license back and it would be worth fifty dollars a month for me
counselor.res	it's a lot
-	-
client.fn	( um ) so i went down and signed up for hud and different things
client.fn	( uh ) i was living with my sons ( uh ) they're very strong minded ( uh ) like me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( uh ) they love me to death until we start to get ( uh ) upset with something and then oh my god i'm the most horrible person in the world and he says all these horrible things to me and stuff
-	-
client.fn	and i just am [nvv] ( i'm not gonna f* ) i'm not gonna get into this argument with you dude
client.fn	i'm sorry you wanna be all angry and yell and scream
client.fn	and he's i won't take this in my house
client.fn	i said sorry i guess you are gonna take it in your house
client.fn	and he said i want you to leave
-	-
client.fn	i said that's too bad that you want me to leave because i'm not leaving
client.fn	you asked me to come here you got all my stuff over here that i've been moving over here for the last month
client.fn	and now because you get angry you say 'oh you're gonna leave' [psh] make me
-	-
client.fn	i say ( y* y* ) you touch me you touch me and i'll call up the police and i'll have you arrested and thrown out of your own house
client.fn	so i said you wanna go there go ahead
client.fn	i said ( uh ) otherwise just mellow out and get out of my face
client.fn	and then i went in my room and he's ranting and raving and
-	-
client.fn	and ( you know ) we're all trying to get our lives together with the lord and everything we go to church all the time
client.fn	so me being the bad guy that i am said to him ( uh ) so i see you're really being an honorable man of god and you're really showing the other people in this house here ( how ) how a christian acts aren't you
-	-
client.fn	and he yelled out fuck god
client.fn	and i said oh really so i said i know who i'm talking to now i'm talking to a little demon child so i won't talk to you anymore
client.fn	and then he's like nobody ever helped me and nobody did nothing for me
client.fn	and ( i was just ) i kind of lost it by that time i was just going wah wah wah
-	-
client.fn	and ( uh ) then that night he sent me a check saying i love you dad i'm sorry
client.fn	and the next day when he saw me he said ( uh uh ) i want to apologize for ( uh ) tomorrow he says but i don't want to talk about it
client.fn	and i says you mean yesterday don't you
-	-
client.fn	and i said because i sure hope it isn't tomorrow
client.fn	because i don't wanna go through what i went through yesterday again
client.fn	and he laughed and the other people in the house laughed because it gets very very tense
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	because i'm the only person that dares oh except for my other son but he's away right now ( uh ) that dares say anything to him ( you know )
-	-
client.fn	he's like god he runs the house and everybody listens to him
client.fn	and i told him i'm sorry son but you're my son ( uh ) you may be an adult now ( uh ) but i'm always gonna give you advice
client.fn	it's up to you whether you choose it and take it or not
client.fn	but don't think i'm not gonna give it because i'm your father and i'm always gonna be your father and if you don't like it sorry [laugh]
-	-
client.fn	so yeah and he gets really angry sometimes when it's like that
client.fn	( and ) and he'll ( he'll ) think about ( the ) what he's doing
client.fn	he's like me before i learned how to control my temper
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i still have a very bad temper [laugh] okay
client.fn	but i most of the time control it even when people are screaming at me and stuff i can sit there and be nice and calm and say okay
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah you work in that field
client.fn	yeah
counselor.su	and ( i know ) i know what you mean there ( uh ) clark
counselor.rec	so tell me so all of that [nvv] along the lines ( of ) of going through the divorce that's made it everything seems like it's come together to make it hard for you not to drink
-	-
client.fn	well at times
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	like i said when ( you know uh ) i'm talking with my ex-wife i'm actually
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( uh ) and not my ex she's just separated from me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but and i've been over her house like ( uh ) well four times in the last week
client.fn	but after this weekend i don't know ( uh ) yeah she was just really starting to wear on me
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.res	not not
-	-
client.fn	and she's the one that wanted to leave you know
client.fn	so i've been more or less kissing her butt this whole time
client.fn	and ( uh ) i'm getting tired of kissing her butt and having her not treat me right
client.fn	i says okay you don't wanna be married that's cool but you want me as a friend
-	-
client.fn	i said you'd better understand something marriage is a hundred-hundred proposition
client.fn	friendship is a fifty-fifty proposition
client.fn	you wanna be my friend you want me to be your friend i mean then you'd better start acting like my friend
client.fn	because i don't have friends that don't treat me with friendship
client.fn	so you better re-think the way you're acting if you want
-	-
client.fn	but the thing is that caused our big problem lately is that she's in a lot of pain and ( s* ) bad bleeding and everything else
client.fn	and then i find out the reason for it is is because she went on birth control the second ( we ) she left me okay
client.fn	and then she says well that was when i was leaving you ( you know ) it's not the same as now
-	-
client.fn	and i said well if it's not the same as now why don't you quit taking the things
client.fn	i said they're ( cau* ) causing you all kinds of problems you're bleeding like crazy you've been in pain for what seven days now eight days
client.fn	( and ) and obviously if you're not wanting to have sex with somebody else there's no reason to be on birth control because i can't get you pregnant and you know that
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	and so ( uh ) she just said yeah ( and and ) but she won't give me an answer or anything
client.fn	and so i just said look ( uh ) you call me when you decide you wanna get off of the birth control
client.fn	and then we can keep on trying to see if we can ( uh ) work on saving our relationship
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.su	boy you're going through [laugh] [nvv] you're going through a lot of different things with family members [nvv] that's gotta be
counselor.rec	so ( that's ) that complicates things as far as ( your ) your alcohol use
client.fn	yeah and i've gone through
-	-
client.fn	chemo twice for hep c and both times i was an early responder and both times it came back
client.fn	so there's no more treatment right now that i can take
counselor.res	for you to take
client.fn	okay and so i'm just ( uh ) slowly exiting the planet okay so ( uh ) there's a lot ( of ) of things that i'm dealing with
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	but i've dealt with a lot of things my entire life so ( uh )
-	-
counselor.af	you got a good background to help you deal with those kind of things i'm impressed actually
counselor.quo	can i ask then ( whe* ) where are you right now with
counselor.res	because you mentioned [du] you want to quit once and for all
counselor.quo	where are you in that [du] right now
client.fn	okay i only
-	-
client.fn	signed that because there was no better choice
client.fn	because i said ( this does not ) these choices are not ( like ) it doesn't explain everything and so this is a
counselor.quo	mm ( tell ) tell me what you were thinking
client.fn	well because what did it say ( i ) i
-	-
counselor.gi	i wanna quit once and for all
client.fn	wanna quit
-	-
client.fn	even though i realize i may slip up
client.r+d1	well the thing is is that i certainly don't wanna be addicted again
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-1	i'm not worried about quitting because i'm not going to use drugs ( um ) as a maladaptive ( uh ) coping strategy
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+1	and if i see myself starting to do that then i'm gonna yeah step back and say what do i have ( to ) to do to change that
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+1	because this is just gonna cause more problems and whatever
counselor.res	so you
-	-
counselor.ec	yeah ( you've made that ) you've made that decision
counselor.quo	what about the alcohol clark
-	-
client.c+1	like i say ( um ) i'm ( uh ) in the that's the one thing i'd probably like to quit for ( uh ) good
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	you know it's not a matter of ( you know ) a drug and alcohol problem when a program wouldn't do nothing for me ( i'd be ) i'd be running the class for the guy
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	( um )
-	-
counselor.quo	what would it take
client.fn	( uh )
counselor.quo	or what would you need
-	-
client.o+1	it's just me saying no you know it's as simple as that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( and ) and i do okay for the first eleven days i've been finding that out and it goes about eleven days
counselor.res	about eleven days
client.fn	and i have my and ( and and i ) talking to other people about addiction and a lot of times they do have a period of time they can do it and then they ( like ) hit a wall
-	-
client.fn	and yeah and something happens and this and that and so they use again
client.fn	but with an addict they just don't have the beer they have as much as they can get their hands on and keep on drinking and drinking and drinking
client.fn	so ( you know ) i've really gotta get it through my head that this is contributing to killing me because i don't believe
client.r+1	i know from research and everything else that it does contribute to your death
-	-
client.r-1	but on the other hand i'm saying to myself come on a beer on occasion is gonna kill me well if it does i might as well die anyways
client.r-1	i mean gees ( uh ) if i was just to look at the glass i would have to say it's almost all the way empty [laugh] ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+1	but it doesn't bother me because ( uh ) i've got god in my life okay and that's the thing that makes the biggest difference
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	okay
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r+1	( the you know ) and then knowing everything i know about addiction doesn't hurt either [laugh]
counselor.fa	exactly exactly
client.fn	so ( um )
counselor.res	[du]
-	-
counselor.rec	so there's a couple strong ( uh ) things to fall back on yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o+1	so ( um ) it's just not a matter of if it's a matter of when i get successful and stay that way
client.fn	it's just like quitting cigarettes you know
client.fn	( uh ) i was a smoking cessation counselor too
counselor.fa	oh okay okay
client.fn	( um and uh ) and ( uh you know ) i always tell people ( you know ) quitting is a process it's not something that just happens one day and then for most people and then you never ever use again okay
counselor.fa	exactly
-	-
counselor.fa	exactly
client.fn	the thing is ( you ) you find out ( uh ) where your weaknesses are what your mistakes were find out different ways to cope with that make yourself stronger or run and flee
client.fn	( you know ) we used to say the ace ( uh ) thing avoid ( uh ) confront or escape ( you know )
client.fn	and ( uh you know ) you do those things ( uh ) whichever works for you
-	-
client.fn	and sometimes one way might work and other times you might just have to escape well escape if you need to ( you know )
client.fn	if you start feeling creepy because you're around people that are doing things that are setting off triggers for you ( you know time to ) time to split
-	-
counselor.res	time to get out of there
counselor.gi	okay interesting
counselor.rec	it sounds like okay ( y* y* ) you've made a decision ( uh ) not to use drugs as a coping mechanism because you have something to fall back on but the alcohol you've made a decision it's just a matter of when
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	would it help you if all these other social issues with your wife and your son were more
-	-
client.fn	well of course [laugh] you know i mean when you're under people find ways to try to get out from under ( the ) the weight of all the things that they're dealing with
counselor.res	yeah yeah yeah so ( it ) that would make it easier
client.fn	and ( um ) depending on how many things that they're dealing with depends on how stressed their coping mechanisms might get
-	-
counselor.rec	so definitely
client.fn	and it might get overwhelmed for some people like ( s* ) a lot of people if they were going through what i ( was ) am going through would probably just break down and go off the deep end in one way or another
counselor.res	am going through yeah
client.r-1	and yeah ( i've ) i've felt a little bad at times i've felt anxiety i've anxiety i've felt some depression
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) and i'm on effexor but i'm not on a high dose
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	or a i'm on seventy_five milligrams ( uh ) but ( um ) that was mostly because i wanted a little help ( with my ) with my temper
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	because the anxiety builds up to me
client.fn	and when i'm really anxious somebody ( you know ) says or does the ( wr* ) wrong thing ( uh ) i had the tendency ( to ) to blow up
client.fn	and this is ( uh ) a lot after my head got run over
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know ) i think it ( uh ) caused a little damage ( you know ) there
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.rec	impulsivity
client.fn	( so um ) but i'm pretty cool i got almost everything under control
counselor.res	oh you're
client.fn	i don't scream at people very often on the highway and we all know what kinda idiots are out there all the time
counselor.res	[du]
-	-
client.fn	( and you know ) i did the other day and i felt really really really bad afterwards
client.fn	because i was ( like ) waiting to pull out in front of walmart and these cars kept on speeding in from ( s* ) a_hundred_and_sixty_fourth street
client.fn	and this other car ( uh ) had left me a space so i could pull out and get in and these people kept on trying to ( cut uh ) cut me off so i couldn't get across
counselor.res	somebody else
-	-
client.fn	so i finally i just started to pull out even though somebody was coming
client.fn	this woman starts beeping at me and she yells at me and i told her you you lady
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	( and ) and then she went go like this with her hands or something and i went like this
client.fn	and then i saw there was a little girl sitting in the backseat ( like ) about three or four years old
-	-
client.fn	and i felt like shit
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	okay and it's like is this the way a christian acts do you go around giving people a finger and dadada and now you ( you know ) traumatize some little girl
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	but that's good because [laugh] it makes me look at myself and say hey i don't like it
counselor.fa	huh
counselor.af	you do you have good insight
-	-
counselor.af	you got a conscience i mean yeah i mean not a lot of people would think of it that way
counselor.quc	( so is ) can i ask was that one_sixty_fourth up north way up north
client.fn	yeah yeah
counselor.gi	yeah i know where that is
-	-
client.fn	yeah martha_lake is right near there
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	you were just up there
-	-
client.fn	i live on the back side of martha i used to live on the back side of martha_lake
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.af	so ( uh ) yeah just an example good example of your insight and your ( you know )
counselor.rec	you reacted but you thought about it afterwards
-	-
client.fn	i wouldn't have if i didn't see that little girl
counselor.fa	[du]
counselor.fa	ahh
client.fn	( she ) she deserved [laugh] she deserved it but the little girl didn't deserve it okay
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.gi	well her
-	-
counselor.gi	mom wasn't setting a good example [du]
client.fn	yeah she was just ( uh )
-	-
client.fn	yeah she didn't like the idea of somebody was cutting in front of her
client.fn	but she didn't realize i've been sitting there for four minutes trying to get out and nobody was letting me get out
counselor.gi	i know that that s*
-	-
counselor.gi	whoever came up with that intersection was not thinking straight at the time
-	-
client.fn	oh that one is crazy
client.fn	coming off the highway and
counselor.gi	it's ridiculous coming off the freeway
client.fn	yeah everybody is trying to get over to this far lane
counselor.gi	people on the
-	-
counselor.gi	freeway trying to go across people who are already in the lane are trying to get into walmart
client.fn	uh-huh
counselor.gi	it's ridiculous
client.fn	uh-huh
counselor.su	i could see where you got caught so
counselor.gi	alright so well we're actually a bit over
counselor.af	but i ( you know ) you've got a lot of insight i mean it's not ( uh ) the things you do ( don't go ) don't happen without you thinking about them
counselor.gi	definitely you've given me a ( lot of uh ) lot of information in that regard
-	-
counselor.su	( um ) i wish you luck with that and i hope things calm down for you
client.fn	mm
counselor.su	it sounds like ( uh uh ) a ( tough ) tough time right now but ( uh )
-	-
client.fn	i feel like i'm in a war
counselor.su	hopefully it'll
client.fn	but hey
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	but like i said ( i ) not the first war i went in
client.fn	i went to prison for five years for ( uh ) six_hundred dollars worth of drugs
client.fn	( uh ) marijuana and mostly marijuana and some l_s_d ( and uh ) just small amounts okay i bought ( like ) one card that cost a_hundred bucks for a card like that
-	-
client.fn	( and uh ) and then the marijuana it was about an ounce of marijuana altogether
counselor.res	that was it huh
client.fn	they came back and kept on having that ( uh ) confidential informant buy ( uh ) an eighth ( uh ) five six times during the week so they could get ( you know like ) seven eight felonies against me so they could get the points up high so they could get me doing the most time they possibly could
-	-
client.fn	when i got in prison some of the counselors in there they were saying now what did you do
client.fn	and i told them how much drugs and they said no no you can't they can't be you can't you're behind the walls in walla_walla okay
client.fn	i said i know i'm one point above ( uh ) minimum okay
-	-
client.fn	and i'm not even in medium because they had no room in medium so they had to put me in max okay with murderers and rapists and hard core hard core
counselor.res	hard core
client.fn	but like i said i can survive in a lot of difficult situations
client.fn	and when i was in there the only thing i did basically was school
-	-
client.fn	they still had you could still get your ( uh ) associates degree
counselor.af	good for you
counselor.res	yeah study
client.fn	not anymore eighth grade ( uh ) education that's it that's all they'll give you now
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	which is a shame because research has shown that the more education somebody has the less ( like* ) likely they are to ( uh ) commit a crime so
counselor.rec	you
-	-
counselor.rec	took advantage
-	-
client.fn	yeah i got my ( uh ) a_a degree from ( uh ) walla_walla
counselor.af	good [du]
client.fn	and ( uh ) i took some ( uh ) advance courses from evergreen because i had just won a big ( uh ) settlement because my mother's ( uh ) wrongful death suit a doctor killed her and then tried to cover it up
client.fn	so i had a bunch of money when i got out of prison
client.fn	( uh ) and some of it before
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	i had to take ( uh ) two french classes in order to get into the university_of_washington because i didn't have any in high school
client.fn	( so ) and they didn't have any ( uh ) language classes there at the penitentiary
client.fn	but i ( uh ) had money so since i was a teaching assistant while i was there the teacher would bring ( the ) my ( uh uh ) video tapes and audio tapes and stuff from my french teacher
client.fn	and i would ( uh ) simply do it by watching films and listening to recordings and i had a three_point_five for ( uh ) both of those ( uh ) french classes
-	-
client.fn	and ( um ) then i got accepted into the university_of_washington
counselor.af	good for you good for you
client.fn	and then i was in for about six weeks and i was in work release and then they didn't want me to go
client.fn	they said it's too dangerous to let you go to the university_of_washington
client.fn	what if you did something what if you robbed somebody what if you raped somebody
-	-
client.fn	i said look at my record is there any violence are there any sex crimes
client.fn	( uh ) and said no and ( that's ) you wouldn't even be considered if it wasn't for that
client.fn	and whoa but all my professors wrote letters for me and stuff because they said
client.fn	one professor i seen him when i was first going there he was crossing the street and he came over and shook my hand and congratulated me
-	-
client.fn	he says you know he says it's really great when you get a student who asks you questions that make you start to ( you know uh think ) think
counselor.res	to think also

client.fn	( you know it's ) it's not like the alcohol
counselor.res	it's not like [du]
client.r-1	the alcohol is like oh there's a knot in my stomach

counselor.quo	( tell ) tell me about then how
counselor.res	because you do ( uh ) marijuana daily also it looks like
client.fn	daily
counselor.quo	tell me how that comes about then
-	-
client.r-2	marijuana ( um ) if i don't have it the only way i wanna go get it is if someone a friend of mine or a family like my girlfriend she wanna smoke it
client.r-2	because she likes to smoke marijuana i'll smoke it with her because she'll smoke it on a daily basis or every other day
-	-
client.fn	so i'll do it with her
client.fn	preferably i'd prefer to go buy the alcohol and just drink the alcohol
counselor.quo	if you
-	-
counselor.quo	( if your ) if your girlfriend didn't smoke
-	-
client.o+2	i wouldn't be bothered with it
-	-
counselor.res	you wouldn't even bother with it
client.fn	mm
counselor.quc	okay and you did you mention other acquaintances too that smoke
client.fn	well
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) other acquaintances ( i have f* uh ) i have friends but i let them go
client.fn	( they're ) they're not really the ( you know ) they were and before they were the issue
client.fn	but since i haven't been hanging with them and been around them for over a year or more i don't i can't even include
counselor.fa	really
-	-
counselor.quc	really because of the alcohol or because of the marijuana
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	uh
counselor.quc	or because of something else
-	-
client.fn	the friends are not there is because of my own mental issues
client.fn	( you know i ) i be up and down a lot
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and it's like i'll take anger out on them if they're around and they don't pretty much wanna deal with that
client.fn	so we're pretty much separated and our friendship's off
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	and they went their way i didn't even try to clean it up or be friends with them after so ( i ) i'm on my own
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	my friend is my girlfriend
client.fn	and like i said when she smoke weed i smoke weed with her
counselor.res	you smoke weed
-	-
counselor.res	( eh ) and it turns out being daily pretty much
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	she don't drink but she smoke weed
counselor.fa	[du]
client.fn	and i drink and smoke weed
counselor.fa	ah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	so you ( wa* ) what i'm hearing is you drink for yourself and you smoke because she's with you
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	and you could more easily eliminate the marijuana than the alcohol
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	have you given thought to not smoking with her
-	-
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	yeah ( um ) but when she do it it'd be ( you know ) it outside of mind with me with it but when she do it i just ( like ) here i'll take a couple puffs from it and ( you know ) give it back to her and i'll be right back to my liquor [du]
counselor.nc	[cough]
-	-
counselor.rec	so you don't even really think about it when you smoke with her
client.fn	no
counselor.rec	it's not as if i shouldn't be doing this or it's not as if well on the other hand it's not if i shouldn't be doing this ( you ) you don't really think about it you just do it right
client.fn	no
-	-
client.fn	yeah i just do it just right behind her
client.o+1	but ( the ) the alcohol on the other hand like i said that seems to be ( the iss* ) the biggest issue with me
counselor.fa	mm
client.r-n1	because it's like i feel like at times i have to have it
counselor.fa	really
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	and do you ever tie the two together the marijuana and the alcohol
counselor.quc	or is it as cut and dry as you say where ( it's it's ) it's the m_j ( is affil* ) is associated with your girlfriend
client.fn	i'm
-	-
client.fn	i dunno i dunno i don't have tie the two together

-	-
client.fn	oh i do
-	-
counselor.res	oh you do
-	-
client.fn	yeah i do but i mean yeah i do do that
client.fn	but like i said i don't feel like marijuana's the issue because i can just take it or leave it
client.o+1	my main issue is the liquor and it's gotten worse over the six months
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	because ( i ) i went from drinking a pint to drinking a half gallon
-	-
client.fn	okay a pint ( i can ) i drink maybe a half i can take a pint and put a coca_cola in it and i'll be fine with half a bottle
client.r+1	a pint i never used to finish a bottle now that's like i can finish a bottle of ( a ) a pint i can drink that by myself and not feel nothing
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.rec	your tolerance is
client.r+1	is high
counselor.quc	and what are you drinking
-	-
client.fn	i'm drinking ( uh ) jim_beam i started with ( uh ) christian_brothers
client.fn	now i left that alone i've been with jim_beam for ( like ) the last past month

client.fn	whiskey
client.fn	i don't drink wine i don't drink beer ( uh just ) just that
counselor.res	beer no
-	-
counselor.gi	hmm so i hate i'm sorry if ( i'm ) i keep returning
client.fn	mm
counselor.res	but marijuana doesn't do the same thing for you that alcohol does
-	-
client.fn	no no not at all
client.r-1	alcohol is ( it's ) it's a feel_good
client.r-1	( it's liquid ) it's the liquid that i dunno i can consume it ( i don't ) like i said i don't get sloth
client.r-d1	i just i like to be tipsy
client.fn	and when i get to that tipsy point i'll fall asleep just go to sleep fucked up
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
counselor.rec	and so you're self_limiting just out of physiologically you're self_limiting
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	it's not as if you have to make the decision ( i'm i'm ) i'm done you just kind of nod off
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	i'll just nod off i'll be watching t_v or trying to do something around the house i'll get tired i'll sit down and i'll just i'll wake up and move onto the next day and drink it again
-	-
counselor.quo	and ( what uh what ) what types of things have you noticed over ( the ) the past six months ( that are ) [sigh] that are a result of your raised consumption of the alcohol
-	-
client.fn	me noticed in the consumption
client.o+1	( um uh ) i dunno it's ( uh ) ( what i do ) what i do notice is this yeah ( i ) i do consume a lot of it ( you know ) and my levels have been high
-	-
counselor.rec	you just notice your tolerance ( is ) is just really high
client.r+1	yeah is really high
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	health_wise
-	-
client.r+1	it's not good for my health health no it's not good at all
client.r+1	because sometimes i'll feel like my kidneys in the back i felt like days i better not even drink the liquor because it felt like it just feel real uncomfortable
counselor.nc	[cough]
counselor.res	so you feel it back there
client.r+1	yeah i felt it real bad and i'd be like oh my god
client.fn	so i won't mess with it that day i'll wait a day or two and then i'll drink it again
-	-
counselor.quc	oh any ( uh ) does your girlfriend have any thoughts or
-	-
client.r+1	she don't want me drinking at all
counselor.quc	reaction to you
-	-
counselor.fa	hmm okay
-	-
client.fn	and she hate that because ( her she ) her parents not her mom but her dad and her brother drink a lot and it really bothers her
client.r+1	so every time she see me with drinking she be my conscience why don't you stop doing that
client.fn	( and and ) and my rebuttal is why don't you stop doing the weed
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah ( uh ) yeah i was gonna say
client.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	exactly so it's ( uh )
counselor.quc	well well
-	-
counselor.quc	can i ask you
counselor.quo	let me ask you why
-	-
counselor.res	[du] yourself
client.fn	( why ) why do i bother
-	-
counselor.quo	no ( why ) why do you think she needs to stop the weed [clears throat]
-	-
client.fn	mm just because i notice when she do weed she's gonna get lazier than when ( she i* ) she is
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and that i don't like in a person ( uh ) so
-	-
counselor.quc	does that affect you in that way
-	-
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	the weed
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	but that's what
client.fn	well
-	-
client.fn	well no no no actually because ( i i s* ) i'm an active person
client.fn	( i ) i like to be clean i'm a clean ( i cl* ) i do everything in the house clean clothes the whole bit
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and when i do do my liquor and i'll smoke weed with her ( get ) i get hyped on it
counselor.nc	[clears throat]
-	-
counselor.rec	( eh ) oh the opposite
-	-
client.fn	yeah and ( she ) as for her she's and she get lazier and she wants to sit around she wanna watch movies and not do any work and so
-	-
counselor.rec	so even though you do smoke it together you inevitably [err] end up doing [laugh] different things and reacting different
-	-
client.fn	totally different
-	-
counselor.gi	( i* i* ) naomi mentioned your naomi
counselor.quc	does she live with you
-	-
client.fn	yeah my daughter live with me
-	-
counselor.quo	your thoughts about that with your smoking and drinking
-	-
client.fn	my daughter she won't be in the room when i'm smoking ( or l* or ) or her mom
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( uh ) she's not a stupid little girl she's i'm sure she knows just because she's in high school what the smell is
counselor.quc	oh is
-	-
counselor.quc	she in high school now
-	-
client.fn	yeah she's in high school
counselor.nc	[cough]
client.fn	i know she knows what the smell is but ( we won't let her ) we won't let her see us indulging in it ( um )
-	-
counselor.res	but she knows
-	-
client.fn	but ( she know ) i'm sure she knows
client.fn	( uh ) she ain't kids ain't stupid
client.r+1	and then we drink that bothers her
client.r+1	because she'll come down and be like say dad how much did you drink today i say oh i had me about four shots or two shots she said don't you think that's enough now oh yeah well i'm done she said good good
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
counselor.fa	wow
client.r+1	( you know ) and ( she told me ) she come home from school and she tell me ( eh um ) they got classes a_a classes she threw that at me a couple times
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	( um ) they say if you drink this'll happen that'll happen because they teach her that in school
client.r+1	she said have you thought about stopping i said yeah i have she said good mm sooner the better
-	-
client.r+1	( you know she'll ) she'll throw that at me every day or every other day she'll throw that at me
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
counselor.quc	does she ever say anything about marijuana to you
-	-
client.fn	no she won't say nothing because i think she feel like she's probably overstepping her boundaries if she say something like that
counselor.fa	really
client.fn	but the alcohol she see me constantly i'm drinking that in front of her
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+1	( you know ) and so she's always like ( you know ) grandma she had cirrhosis of the liver ( you know ) she committed suicide are you going that route
-	-
client.r+1	no well ( you know she ) she'll just keep making pot shots at me
-	-
counselor.quo	and what's your feelings on that
client.r+1	i feel bad
counselor.res	you feel bad it makes you feel bad
client.r+1	[du] it makes me
-	-
client.r+1	feel ( like ) like crap because my daughter's taken notice to it ( you know ) that's my pride and joy
client.o+1	so ( you know ) it's given me more thought about trying to give it up
-	-
counselor.quc	does she approach is she approaching both of you in this regard or just dad
client.fn	just
client.fn	me
counselor.fa	yeah okay
-	-
client.fn	because she's seen me just
client.fn	she know mom don't like liquor so she don't bother with her
-	-
counselor.fa	[clears throat] wow oh
-	-
client.fn	oh let me turn this off
-	-
counselor.gi	your form that you filled out with naomi states ( um ) that you don't want it to be a habit anymore but you want to be able to use occasionally
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	occasionally
counselor.quc	and ( is that an accurate ) is that accurate
counselor.quc	do you think that's possible
-	-
client.o+1	yeah truthfully no
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah ( i wa* ) i was wondering
-	-
client.o+1	yeah truthfully no
client.o-1	it's just something i would like to be able to control and do it every now and again
client.o+1	but i don't see that really i see ( it's ) it's out of control and if i keep telling myself i wanna do that then ( um ) instead ( uh ) it's gonna get worse
client.fn	so i have to figure out either leave it alone
-	-
counselor.rec	( so ) so you want to but you're not feeling totally confident about it
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah and ( i don't wanna i don't ) i don't wanna be a hypocrite about it ( you know ) just oh i'm gonna stop i'm gonna stop i'm gonna stop
client.fn	i wanna to be able when i go in and just be like oh i'm done
client.r-1	but it's hard it is hard for me
client.fn	let me call you back
-	-
counselor.rec	so ( you know ) it sounds like you've been thinking about it a lot and it's just very difficult for you because it's such a for the past six months especially it's been such a big part of your life
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	the marijuana not so much [laugh]
counselor.gi	i mean
-	-
client.r+a2	it's not really i can leave that alone

counselor.res	from your standpoint we don't even need to talk about it
-	-
client.r+a2	i can leave that alone
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-d1	( it's just ) it's the alcohol that's really i'll be honest i've never really liked anything more than that
counselor.fa	really
client.fn	[laugh] yeah so
-	-
counselor.gi	that says a lot
-	-
client.r+d1	( you know ) i've never really bothered with but i like [du]

counselor.rec	it's that hard for you
client.fn	yeah
-	-

client.r-d1	but ( it's ) it i like that
client.r-a1	i can leave everything but that
client.fn	it's like i dunno it's
-	-
counselor.rec	so that makes it doubly hard
-	-
client.fn	yeah and i thought when i was talking to pamela_kaiser a while ago and she was asking me about it i was sure i could leave it alone
client.fn	and i did try but
-	-
counselor.quc	can i ask you in what context you were talking to pam

-	-
counselor.quo	all right so what have you tried so far michael
-	-
client.fn	as far as what
-	-
counselor.gi	trying to quit
-	-
client.fn	i haven't
-	-
counselor.gi	okay that might be part of it right there
-	-
counselor.gi	you just haven't had the right
client.fn	i thought i was strong enough to say oh i'm done
-	-
counselor.res	you were gonna try the willpower thing
-	-
client.fn	yeah because that was the deal with the cigarettes i did that
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	you quit cigarettes on your own
-	-
client.fn	no problem
-	-
counselor.quc	cold turkey
-	-
client.fn	cold turkey
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	no problem no problem and i have no urges for it or anything
-	-
counselor.rec	but this was different
-	-
client.fn	this is different
client.o+1	( it's ) it's got a hold of me
client.r+n1	and ( i have to ) i have to figure out how to
client.r+d1	like i don't wanna feel like i'm ( like ) one of my family members because ( they all ) they all on some heavy things and when i look at them it's like i don't wanna be nothing like that
-	-
counselor.res	ah so there's others that you've seen
-	-
client.r+a1	yeah and that's what causes me to feel like ( i ) i can do it stop doing anything
counselor.res	that was
client.r+1	because all i do is look at them and reflect look at them and be like ( you know ) no that's pushing the marker
-	-
counselor.fa	wow okay
-	-
client.fn	because ( they're on ) they're on heroin and everything that i just don't want no part of
client.r-d1	so but this alcohol yes it's something that i do have to be honest about i do like it
-	-
counselor.gi	and it's ( um ) yeah ( i i i i i i ) i don't often hear somebody say ( they ) they like it
counselor.gi	( i ) i hear i need it a lot or it helps it's just interesting ( that that ) that you phrase it that way
client.fn	mm
counselor.gi	and that's how you feel obviously
client.fn	mm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	[cough] and ( uh ) but it's interesting that you've quit the cigarettes ( um )
-	-
client.r+6	cigarettes taste nasty
-	-
counselor.quc	is that what it is
client.fn	it was easy
-	-
client.fn	it was easy
client.fn	( i ) first i started out doing it and ( you know ) i grew up seeing everyone doing it and tried it and got comfortable with it
client.r+d6	and i never liked the taste of it
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+6	and then ( um ) when i got my girlfriend she was never a smoker she said that's a bad habit you smell like an ashtray got tired of hearing it i was like okay i'm gonna
counselor.res	so that
-	-
counselor.res	wasn't hard because it tasted nasty to you
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+6	yeah it was nasty
counselor.res	you're
-	-
counselor.res	one of those folks who
-	-
client.fn	i could do without it
counselor.res	it just wasn't
-	-
counselor.quo	yeah what about
counselor.quc	can i ask
counselor.quc	so ( have you ) have you detoxed from alcohol
-	-
client.fn	mm just cold turkey stop
client.fn	i tried it for a week
client.fn	i never went in a program never did anything like that no
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	but i tried to do it on my own
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	because i felt i was strong enough
client.r-d1	and it's like i like the taste of alcohol and
-	-
counselor.quc	so with the ( deto* ) i mean ( did you phys* ) did you physically go through detox
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) yeah well ( i ) i didn't do nothing didn't drink no beer didn't
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.res	( s* )
client.r-1	and it just is ( like ) something nagging ( like ) in my head constantly go ahead
client.fn	but yeah
counselor.res	so ( um )
-	-
counselor.rec	so still it was more that you just ( n* ) were itching to have it more than it wasn't the physical discomfort of detoxing that made you go back it's just you just constantly want it
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	no
client.r-d1	want it
counselor.rec	and nothing else is like that to you the marijuana or the cigarettes obviously
client.fn	no
counselor.gi	because ( uh ) nicotine addiction is usually real tough for folks
client.fn	is strong
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	not for you though
-	-
client.fn	( i picked up and you you know ) i picked up from that so bad it was like whoa
client.fn	( i ) i went from smoking a half a cigarette to almost smoking two cigarettes behind each other i almost looked like a chain smoker
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	it's like oh my goodness it was a craving and i was feeling good
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	but ( that was ) that was easy to let that go
-	-
counselor.fa	it was huh
-	-
client.r-1	yeah with ( like ) alcohol it's not like that
-	-
counselor.quc	okay so have you thought about treatment
-	-
client.fn	i wanna be ready for that treatment and mentally
client.o-1	because if i don't i won't i'll say yeah and i'll go probably once twice then leave it alone
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quo	but ( what'll ) what will tell you you're ready

client.fn	yeah that's exactly what it is
counselor.rec	failure

counselor.rec	but at the same time you're not really sure ( uh ) what will make you ready
counselor.quc	is it more would it be ( more ) maybe more from your daughter
counselor.quc	( uh ) would it ( nee* ) have to be something medically

client.o+1	oh yeah it might it'd probably be medically and my daughter those two things
counselor.quc	to get to you

client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm but triple access or access is equal or something
-	-
counselor.quo	yeah so tell me a little bit about ( how ) how often you're using and
-	-
client.fn	[clears throat] do you want me to give you a background
-	-
counselor.gi	briefly [laugh]
client.fn	okay okay
-	-
client.fn	started using drugs ( uh ) when i was fifteen
client.fn	( pro* ) progressed through ( uh ) several times by the courts and ( uh ) outside influences to put me back on a track ( that ) that would lead me to a healthy normal life without drugs or alcohol
client.fn	( um ) so here i am twenty_four none of those things having worked or i mean ( how ) however you wanna put it
-	-
client.o-7	and [clears throat] so right now it's kinda ( like ) in my day ( i ) i maintain the idea that it's not a problem for me anymore
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	because last treatment i went through and i did fine i didn't do drugs for a long time almost a year ( like ) ten months or something
-	-
counselor.quc	so how long ago was the last treatment
client.nc	[clears throat]
counselor.gi	just push that to the s*
-	-
client.fn	( um ) the fourth month ( like ) the twenty_ninth would be ( uh ) that day last year is when i began a six month treatment
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	graduated then stayed in for a month over while i went to fair_start and then from fair_start i moved into the men's program
client.fn	from the men's program dab a little smoke a little pot drink a little bit
-	-
client.r-1	just trying to get ( like like ) what i remember ( which was ) which was ( uh ) relief you know what i'm saying from just ( like ) [clears throat] ( the the ) the threat of the problem encroaching you know what i'm saying
-	-
counselor.res	well i'm not so it sounds like you ( s* ) were drinking and smoking the pot
counselor.quo	what's
-	-
client.fn	very occasionally
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	( and ) and it made you feel better
-	-
client.r+d1	no i hated it
-	-
counselor.quo	okay so what was the threat that was approaching
-	-
client.fn	just that ( uh ) i'm not [clears throat] okay here just ( quick ) quickly and ( like ) a small part of it
client.r-1	i'm not feeling ( uh uh ) enough life isn't gonna be enough i'm not gonna get the things that i want ( uh ) there's too many problems
client.fn	what's the problem you know what i'm saying
client.r-1	i can't live up to the standard that i know i need to be living up to there's not the right circumstances in my life there's not the right situation in my life there's not the right people in my life
-	-
client.r-1	i'm never gonna be able to manufacture the kind of quality people that i'd like to be with
client.r-1	be like what's the point in living when all i have is what i've been dealt
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like you'd like to be around some quality people and you'd like to have a better life
client.fn	right
counselor.quc	( and uh ) and you don't feel that that's happening for you
-	-
client.fn	no check this out ( here's the ) here's the thing
client.fn	( uh ) i had these friends that didn't work
client.fn	so ( like ) of all these ( like ) little pockets of people that i could be ( uh ) engaged with none of it's worked right
client.fn	but then there's this there's the church right that i go to church_of_jesus_christ_latter_day_saints
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	not that i was born into it baptized right
-	-
client.fn	so i'm reading my scriptures ( you know ) and i know that for me to be the ideal person so that i can look back on myself and say that i am who i desire myself to be through the perceptions of others and ( uh ) my perception of my own life i have to go back to church
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	you know what i'm saying
-	-
client.fn	and i have to be willing to put myself ( uh ) in a position to fail for the sake of ( like ) because i gotta do whatever it takes
client.fn	i dunno how it is to live out life you know what i'm saying
client.fn	( like uh like ) hey as long as you don't drink you know what i'm saying but just keep coming back ( you know ) fail forward and all this other good stuff
-	-
client.fn	so same thing at church ( you know )
client.fn	i go and i try i try i try i try i try until it starts working out that i have church i have my kids my kids are my connection to ( all ) all my ( uh ) old friends
client.fn	( you know ) church is my new life i go to school find some nice girl get married family's happy everybody's okay yeah
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.quc	is that something
counselor.quc	that getting married finding the right people is that something you want
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yes
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yeah but see i want yeah but see i wanna be in the mindset to know that i'm the kinda person that will be satisfied with that
counselor.res	you
counselor.res	you do
client.fn	because last time right ( i had ) i had ( uh ) baby's mom ( you know ) and then ( you know ) it was gonna be her kid never our kid you know what i'm saying and it was gonna be
client.fn	so ( i ) i became ( like ) very ( uh ) i dunno if the word's flagrant but i just was drinking around the kids and ( uh ) getting all fucked up
-	-
client.fn	then i left them because i was shooting meth you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( uh i didn't ) i didn't want it to be her you know what i'm saying because she didn't listen
-	-
counselor.quo	you didn't want what to
-	-
client.fn	( uh my ) my wife to be my baby's mom at the time
client.fn	because she didn't listen even ( if like ) if we were never gonna get better than ( what we ) what we were you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	so i don't want that
client.fn	what i want is i have this clearly defined picture of a woman in my head ( one that ) one that listens
client.fn	i'm not this ( like uh ) hard_minded stubborn person but i was like i know what you should know looks good you know what i'm saying
-	-
client.fn	( just by ) just by reason you know what i'm saying
client.fn	i'd be like ( that's how people ) that's how people ( uh ) determine their relationships anyways you know what i'm saying
client.fn	based on ( like ) mutual understanding of ( like ) value and gain
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like you have a picture in your head of where you wanna be
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	( and you have a re* ) and you have your faith that kinda tells you where you wanna be
-	-
client.fn	right but i don't see i don't ( uh ) reinforce that faith ( on ) on ( the ) the blind side
client.fn	which is why ( like ) this is what i know but i can't it's not concrete for me
client.fn	so instead of ( like ) taking action make it concrete by ( like ) showing my faithfulness to ( uh ) the hopes that i have to manifest themselves in my life
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	so ( like ) by not taking the action to prove my faith i'm not exercising ( uh ) my belief in my own faith
counselor.res	so
client.fn	so faith becomes this intangible[err] disconnect
-	-
counselor.rec	okay ( it ) it really sounds like you've thought about this a lot
-	-
client.fn	yeah and that's see this is the problem
client.fn	i'm twenty_four and i already know this you know what i'm saying
client.fn	( because that ) because that's what i do
client.fn	but see ( the fact that ) the fact that it won't happen for me and the fact that ( it's ) it's my responsibility to give up something of myself in the hopes of having ( my ) my hopes which are disconnect ( uh you know ) [du]
counselor.res	so you
-	-
counselor.rec	can't give up anything it sounds like you can't give up something to attain this goal
client.fn	uh
client.fn	kind of
counselor.rec	that you yourself feel that there's something in you that's keeping you from going after this goal
-	-
client.fn	( um uh ) kind of i mean ( it ) it's a combination of others ( and like ) and me
client.fn	but see i'm not responsible for them all
client.fn	i can do is ( like ) say hey this is what i need this is what you know ( this is what you know ) this is what i like wanna know about
counselor.quc	wh*
counselor.quc	so
-	-
counselor.quc	when you think about this goal is there anything that you think about
counselor.quc	is there ever any time that you think about it and think hey i could do this if only you'd made some sort of change ( or ) or
counselor.quc	what do you ever see yourself achieving the goal in any time you're thinking about this
counselor.res	it ( soun* ) you talk about the disconnect
-	-
counselor.quc	i'm just wondering if there are times ever when you think about your goal ( the ) the family and changing your life going to is there any time you see that in your head ( and ) and see it attainable
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( um i ) i dunno
client.fn	( like what i ) what it sparks to mind ( like ) is the hope in what you said
client.fn	and that's ( like ) thinking about ( uh ) when i hear little kids ( uh you know at ) at a park or something thinking about that being time that i could eventually maybe spend with my kids
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	and ( you know ) imagining ( uh my ) my wife or whatever next to me sometimes while i'm lying in bed ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	but beyond that ( like ) i know it's either gonna happen or it's not i don't
counselor.quc	so
-	-
counselor.quo	and how could it happen
-	-
client.fn	( um ) i dunno ( uh ) through the power of god
client.fn	which is ( you know like ) i mean it's ( like ) a drastic change and then it's ( like uh ) but for some reason ( like uh ) change ( it doesn't ) it doesn't last for me
client.fn	because ( it's like ) it's ( like like ) for a_a for example right [clears throat]
-	-
client.fn	if i stop doing drugs and i go to a_a
client.fn	dude i've been to a_a since i was fifteen years old i'm twenty_four
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i've had sponsors ( i've ) i've been known by the group you know what i'm saying
client.fn	and i've seen all their flaws and i've looked past them i've continued to go to a_a meetings
client.fn	but ( i never found ) i never found the true sense of conviviality ( that's suppo* ) that's supposed to be present you know what i'm saying
-	-
client.fn	( it's uh ) it always seems like this thing ( like ) i'm in this alone to prove you ( for my ) for myself
client.fn	or to prove you for yourself that this is all a one_man game and that if you can't do it for yourself well then i'm proof that i can do it for myself
client.fn	you know what i'm saying there's not this sense of ( like ) connection
-	-
client.fn	there's not this sense of ( like ) being willing to lay aside ( my ) my beliefs to take on your beliefs to try to help you find some way of coping with your own belief structure
client.fn	which is instilled in you ( by ) the process that made you who you were
client.fn	which is very powerful i mean because that makes you who you are but i dunno
-	-
client.r-7	but basically bottom line i don't get the friendships that i think that i need that i think that i deserve anywhere
client.fn	so it's like i'm constantly in this state having gone from everyone even my family
client.fn	which is ( like you know ) it's not you could probably look ( like ) that sad
client.fn	but ultimately ( uh ) my family being ( uh )
client.fn	i ( dis* ) disconnect my mom's gonna die you're gonna die i'm gonna walk out of this room and probably never talk to you again you know what i'm saying
-	-
client.fn	and ( it's like ) it's a cynical attitude that's instilled in me
client.fn	so it's ( like ) fuck why bother sorry not to get all ( like you know ) jumpy or whatever
client.fn	but i mean go to a_a meetings so i try to make attitude you know what i'm saying try to be serious with them try to freak out and be like dude i'm a fricking drug addict what am i supposed to do
-	-
client.fn	you know what i'm saying everybody's got this help help help yourself you know what i'm saying
client.o-7	you know what i'm doing to help myself doing drugs
client.fn	( buy ) by your own admission because you say
counselor.quo	now
-	-
counselor.quo	how is it helping you
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	huh
counselor.quo	( how ) how is doing the drugs helping you
client.nc	[clears throat]
counselor.quo	tell me that
client.r-7	it gives me
-	-
client.r-7	a temporary release from my own insanity
client.o+7	( if ) if we wanna call ( uh ) i'll call i'll agree to call it insanity because ( like you know ) drug addiction is insane you're continuing to use in spite of negative consequences which ( like you know i ) i have negative consequences
client.fn	i've known that since ( uh ) i was arrested when i was fifteen just getting involved in drug use
-	-
client.fn	and it's never gone away
client.r+7	there's always a social stigma
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah okay so ( when you ) when you finished the treatment a year ago did you have any time half a year ago
client.fn	mm
-	-
client.fn	yes started in four_twenty_nine and then for six months
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quo	half a year ago you finished the treatment and you came out and what happened
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	um
counselor.quc	you were
client.fn	fine
-	-
client.fn	dude ( like ) check this out ( like ) this is what i did
client.fn	i did exactly ( what i what i ) what i cared to do which everybody knew that i was gonna do which was get through the treatment program and be fine and on my way to living ( a ) a life drug_free
client.fn	not successfully drug_free because i wasn't happy about this whole thing
client.fn	i had no goals i had no direction no future
client.fn	that was all provided for me by people that said that they wanted to help which they did
-	-
counselor.gi	so ( let ) let me understand it a little bit
counselor.res	so when you think about ( your ) your life dream it sounds like which is ( the ) the family ( and the ) and the connection with your church and
client.nc	[clears throat]
client.fn	farm
-	-
client.fn	and stuff like that's right
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	[du]
counselor.res	farm
-	-
counselor.gi	okay that's new
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	( um ) and when ( you ) you don't think about those things when you're in treatment as
client.fn	mm
counselor.rec	you ( s* ) kinda have them out there as a goal but it sounds like you haven't ever sorted out the ways to get to that
client.fn	right
client.fn	mm
-	-
client.fn	right yeah there's something about ( uh ) breaking your goals into more manageable goals ( you know ) smaller short_term goals
counselor.res	so the
-	-
counselor.quc	and the goal setting when you're in treatment is
counselor.quc	you don't have any goals when you're in treatment you yourself
client.fn	mm
counselor.af	because you sound like you're a great you've got great ideas and great thinking
-	-
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	( um i'm sor* ) i'm sorry what was the question
-	-
counselor.rec	so when you ( you don't ) you don't it doesn't sound like you participate in making the goals when you're in treatment
client.fn	mm
counselor.rec	because ( you ch* ) you kinda said to me that when you came out of treatment there were no there were the other people's goals and you weren't happy when you were in treatment so
client.fn	right
-	-
client.fn	( um ) it i think when i i think what it comes down to is that ( uh ) learning to survive emotionally you know what i'm saying learning to get along or have ( like ) a mcattitude like i was saying earlier
client.fn	( like ) that comes easy for me it's easy for me to go into a situation and be like check this out this is what we have to do now
-	-
client.fn	and i'm gonna try to have a positive attitude about it because i'm only going to get out of this what i put into it
client.fn	so if i put a positive attitude into it and i know that i did the right thing and then knowing that the right thing was done
client.fn	so my life was done well or rightly ( you know ) because i lived rightly by myself
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and all that's garbage you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but the bottom line is that ( it's like ) it's like [clears throat] ( if that all my uh if ) if that's all my life is then i can change my thoughts in the same way that i'm changing ( uh ) my attitude like my predisposed attitude
client.fn	walking into any situation i can gear that over here to my drug use and then just know that it's all gonna be okay
-	-
client.fn	that i can just walk into this situation and if somebody has a problem with this somebody's always gonna have a problem with something no matter where i go
client.fn	and ( if uh ) if i don't have a positive attitude about it and knowing that i'm gonna continue on this way because ( you know ) this is what's put before me you know what i'm saying
-	-
client.fn	( like ) i appreciate that ( i could ) i could ( like ) leave because ( this is this is ) this is the goodness of what ( i got ) i got out of what you said
client.fn	be like okay what are some goals that i could have set for myself today this is what i was just thinking when you were asking me a question
client.o+7	i was thinking like i could go to an a_a meeting i could make my goal today to not be do drugs
client.r+7	because then ultimately ( i'm not ) i'm not getting any closer to my goals by continuing to do drugs
counselor.rec	your
-	-
counselor.rec	other goals the
-	-
client.fn	( the the the ) the true ( like )
-	-
counselor.rec	the good goals ( that ) ( you s* ) that you've set for yourself
client.fn	right right
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	so are the drug goals bad goals
counselor.gi	let's get let me clarify that
-	-
client.r+7	( they're ) they're aimless and headed for a wall
-	-
counselor.res	so ( the drug u* ) the drug use is aimless and headed for a wall
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	[du]
counselor.quo	and the good goals are
-	-
client.o+7	( uh ) but everlasting and full of joy ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	[du] just
counselor.rec	so
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.rec	it doesn't sound like the aimless and headed for wall doesn't sound very good
client.fn	no
counselor.rec	so you don't like it really
-	-
client.r+d7	no i don't like doing drugs no i don't
client.r+7	because i ( it it ) it pushes me deeper ( uh ) in a direction ( uh ) that i'm striving to ( uh )
-	-
counselor.quc	would you ever change it
-	-
client.o+7	well that's the goal
-	-
counselor.res	that is your goal to change it
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	and how would you do it
counselor.rec	without thinking about the a_a or people setting goals for you because you do have goals you clearly have your own goals
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	right
-	-
client.fn	mm yeah i think what it is ( uh ) i think it would be it would have to do with
client.fn	( uh uh ) this is the answer that i think that you wanna hear that i think would be reasonable ( in ) in ( like ) the sight of a committee you know what i'm saying of ( uh ) well_established well_founded ( uh ) what ( like ) cultural hardbodies whatever that means
client.fn	it's a bunch of garbage ( like ) total garbage [du]
-	-
client.o+7	( uh ) i'm only gonna get off of drugs if i make the decision to get off of drugs you know what i'm saying
client.fn	so i it's all on me right
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	i mean that puts me ( in the ) in the same position that i was in before ( like ) alone
client.fn	this is what i think ( uh ) this is what ( i ) i think
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.gi	i
-	-
counselor.gi	i wanna hear what you think
client.fn	okay
counselor.quo	i don't care about the committee or anything because yeah i wanna know how what you would like to do to get off drugs
client.fn	okay okay
client.fn	okay hang on
-	-
client.fn	( this is ) this is what i think it'll ( l* ) look like right
client.o+7	[clears throat] at some point hopefully sooner rather than later preferably before school starts in the fall right ( i'll ) i'll ( like ) have this big struggle
client.o-7	maybe still be doing drugs
client.fn	and then get involved ( in ) in the church
-	-
client.fn	( like ) go back to them and be like demand help from them in the form of support and interest or ( like uh um like cumu* ) cumulative engagement or cumulative attention direction
client.fn	( they like ) they gotta give me something to work for make it worth my while and themselves because i mean they're not
-	-
client.fn	and ( you know like ) church they're supposed to love their brother and stuff like this you know what i'm saying
counselor.gi	excuse me
-	-
client.fn	so ( um ) so ( basically that's what ) basically what i'd go do is i'd go and i'd reach my hand out and ( if there's if there's any ) i mean if there's any [du] like good in the world
client.fn	because ( if there's ) if there's not then i'm not gonna sit check this out i'm not gonna sit and work for something ( that ) that ( uh ) i don't need or is unreasonable or that ( i can ) i can turn away from it and have the same attitude about my life anyways because i can cultivate that
-	-
counselor.quc	so when you go back to the church and s* in the fall and say to them hey i'm here i want the help i want the support are you still gonna be using drugs
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	or is your plan to go back there not using
client.fn	uh
client.fn	mm
-	-
client.r+7	well ( the ) the ( uh ) ( i can't ) i can't go there under the influence
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+7	okay yeah but ( uh ) the reality of it is is ( like i've ) i've put myself at a point now ( i'm coming ) i'm coming ( wi* ) to terms with that ( like ) i've started ( like ) i've revved up again full_blown addiction you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( from ) from being abstinent for ( su* ) such a period of time
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( you know i'm ) i'm at the point where it's ( like ) i don't believe that i'm an addict i believe that i have the choice to stop you know what i'm saying
counselor.af	well that's
counselor.af	good huh
client.fn	yeah but ( uh ) the ( um ) in a day to day struggle the gains for me is gonna come from ( uh ) self_gratification over ( uh ) what what other kind of gratification is there
client.fn	because i'm not gonna get from people that i've already tried working with
-	-
client.fn	( any ) any kind of comforts security care that i can't provide myself by altering my mind you know what i'm saying
-	-
counselor.gi	not exactly
-	-
client.fn	( um there's there is no deep long ( term[err] ) gain by ( uh ) involving myself with people that are transient
client.fn	so by going to a_a meetings ( they were ) they weren't in there in it for the long haul
client.fn	they wanna see me in it for the long haul
client.fn	the only person i'm in it ( wi* uh uh ) for the long haul for is me
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	right i told them what i was willing to do you know what i'm saying
-	-
counselor.quo	who are they that you're telling this to
client.fn	and
client.fn	a_a
-	-
client.fn	a_a ( or ) or ( even back ) even back ( uh ) the friends that i had that were still using drugs you know what i'm saying
counselor.res	the a_a
counselor.res	groups
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	it was for there is ( this ) this big cluster but ultimately i can step back and not let it go to my head
-	-
counselor.ec	so the power is in your hand
client.fn	and um
client.fn	sure
counselor.rec	in your mind the power is in your hand
client.fn	i mean where else
-	-
client.fn	would it be
-	-
counselor.rec	in your mind
client.fn	right
counselor.rec	okay so and you've it sounds like you've from the time you got out of treatment six months ago you've come right back to
counselor.quc	have you come back to where you were using drugs before or are you still somewhere below where you used
counselor.quo	where when did you last use the most
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( i ) ( don't ) ( i ) i don't i have i live in a shelter now so i have guaranteed food
counselor.quo	drugs
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( um ) not shooting dope
client.r+d5	and i don't ( really like ) really wanna do a whole bunch of meth ( um )
-	-
counselor.quc	and when was the last time you ( sho* ) used some meth
client.fn	i have
-	-
client.fn	oh the last time i shot dope was ( like ) it was a week ago
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	is that less than
client.nc	[clears throat]
-	-
client.fn	oh yes
-	-
counselor.quc	a year ago
-	-
client.fn	yes yes
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	a year ago
-	-
counselor.quc	so have you cut back on your own
-	-
client.fn	( y* ) yeah but it ( that's ) that's
-	-
counselor.quc	is it consciously cutting back
-	-
client.r+d7	i just don't because i don't wanna be doing this again
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+d7	i don't wanna be here in my life again
client.o+7	( i ) ( want ) i wanted to ( have ) have ( uh ) gone through treatment and then picked up those great friends that i know that are gonna be there
counselor.af	that's good
client.fn	and it's kinda like ( uh ) the good choices that we all make fuel the direction and energy towards the good choices that we will make you know what i'm saying
-	-
client.fn	and it's this and this and then i should have never been able to get disconnected in the salvation_army
client.fn	i ( should ) should have never the whole point ( and ) and it's
client.fn	check this out it's my responsibility again it's all my responsibility
client.fn	so who cares really who cares if i don't care who cares
-	-
counselor.quc	do you care
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) of course i care everybody cares
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so you care about how you behave and your response to drugs
-	-
client.o-7	mm ( uh ) no ( i ) check this out i believe i can handle myself on drugs yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-7	it's the public at large that believes that no drug use can be handled well by anyone
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	okay you see especially a person in my position slamming dope
client.fn	because ( if ) if slamming dope was it was okay and people can handle themselves shooting dope then shooting dope would be ( il* e* ) would be ( uh ) legalized
-	-
counselor.quo	so tell me how that's working for you
client.fn	what
counselor.quo	the slamming the dope and ( uh ) it's and
-	-
client.o+7	it doesn't because
counselor.quo	and control and
-	-
counselor.quo	( and ) and being able to live in society
-	-
client.r+7	right it doesn't because it's shunned
client.fn	right so i can't
-	-
counselor.rec	so the people are shunning you even though you feel that you could use the dope and still participate in society
client.fn	i know i have
-	-
client.fn	right
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	right but check this out
-	-
counselor.rec	but you didn't like shooting the dope in front of your kids
-	-
client.fn	no ( yeah because ) yeah because it's dead
client.fn	no ( thi* thi* thi* this is just ) this is just good argument okay
client.fn	no ( i re* ) i recognize that ( uh ) for society to exist right ( uh it has ) it has laws and directives and guide ( uh ) the body as a whole that are ( uh ) equally good for one member as for another that such is right and good
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like you're constantly arguing with yourself in some respect
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	( because everyth* ) because it feels to me like you're saying some things that are contradictory
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah for sure dude
client.fn	because it's this side and that side too ( you know ) positive negative
-	-
counselor.rec	it's like you've got a yin and a yang black and a white arguing all the time in your head
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	who's gonna win
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) well the white obviously which is why ( you know ) and ( like ) that kinda takes some of the relief off my hands you know what i'm saying to just know that i'm in the hands of something much greater than myself me only being a part of it you know what i'm saying
client.fn	and knowing that there ( you know ) the intrinsic good will win out
-	-
client.fn	now am i gonna be cast aside ( the ) into ( the ) the negative darkness
client.fn	no ( not ) not by something that loves me nourished me into being the person i am which is
counselor.quo	and
counselor.quo	that
-	-
counselor.quo	who is that who
client.fn	god
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( which is ) which is good
client.fn	( you know ) because ( like ) ultimately ( you know i ) i'm just a child i just wanna ( you know ) know that ( you know uh ) my mommy loved me and my kids are okay and all that good stuff
client.fn	( you know ) and then so that kinda takes some of the weight off me
client.fn	but then the pressure's still there as ( like ) [cough] i mean half my life is gone ( you know m* uh ) however you wanna look at it
counselor.gi	a third
-	-
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	( let's ) let's go with a third
client.fn	okay
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.r+n7	and then ( uh ) so ( um you know ) i gotta make choices now
client.o+7	if i don't start growing now ( you know )
client.o+7	here i am again still doing drugs ( like ) not making any headway where's the progress where's the promise
-	-
counselor.quo	and how are we how would you get there
client.fn	huh
counselor.quo	how would you get there
-	-
client.fn	( um ) i dunno i think that it's gonna be done for me
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.res	ahh so it has to be done for you
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.fn	well check this out experience is gonna put me in the position to where i'll be taught and know ( the choices ) the answers to the choices that i will need to make to provide myself with the things that i will be provided for in a pre_known life
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	do you ever think you're deluding yourself in some of this
-	-
client.fn	doesn't everybody delude themselves
counselor.gi	( y* )
client.fn	everybody
counselor.gi	yeah
client.fn	because anybody that can't see
counselor.gi	but some people may
-	-
counselor.gi	sometimes a little bit more than others i mean
-	-
client.fn	( i can ) i can keep a ( uh ) i can walk out of this room and the things that i'm talking to you about no one would ever know that i thought those things because i can act just like you
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	i can act totally ( mc* ) mccool you know what i'm saying and have great customer service ( uh ) great etiquette okay
-	-
client.fn	courtesy and ( uh ) [clears throat] make it look good okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i have book smarts do you know what i'm saying
-	-
counselor.af	right you do
-	-
client.fn	and so for me to look like anybody else normally and have the ability to rationally exclude my delusion at the point which it'll become
client.fn	because all delusion is founded on fact right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so to be able to cut that out even to persuade you to be led into the realization of my delusion in yourself i can do that too
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm and yet still use the drugs
-	-
client.r+7	drugs kinda take the edge off
client.r+7	( it ) it lets me be like yeah i'm crazy i'm just crazy
client.fn	be like all this stuff really wasn't ( uh ) dah dah dah dah you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	see that would be an example [du]
-	-
counselor.quc	now do you
-	-
client.fn	[clears throat] i'm not [du]
counselor.quc	do you ever ( s* )
-	-
counselor.quc	do you ever cut back on your drugs
client.fn	drugs
-	-
client.o-7	i don't need much dude
client.o-1	if i drink ( like ) a twenty_four ounce and ( like uh ) smoke two ( like ) little toothpick joint or ( like ) two hits ( you know ) i'm fine dude
client.fn	because really
-	-
client.fn	uh
counselor.quc	how often
-	-
client.fn	a day
counselor.res	a day
client.fn	yeah because check this out okay ( we'll ) we'll double that in a day and we'll say that that was a long day
client.fn	( that's ) so that's ( like ) four beers and a bowl of pot to a normal user in a day that's plenty plenty plenty
client.fn	now check this out ( um ) okay between two people a dime and i mean however really you ( want ) wanna look at it
-	-
client.r-2	i smoke for effect
client.o-2	i don't smoke for
client.fn	well everybody smokes for effect
client.fn	check this out i dunno why that did it
-	-
counselor.rec	so marijuana seems to be the biggie
counselor.quc	is marijuana here the drug that
counselor.quc	what's your primary drug of choice here
counselor.quc	this ( um ) the alcohol the pot or the dope
client.fn	i'd say all of them
-	-
client.r+7	but ( i ) i mean ( i don't ) ( i don't ) ( like ) yeah but i don't like ( they don't ) they don't give me the ( that it's ) that it's been a long time since i could ( like ) actually ( get ) get there
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.res	they're all
counselor.res	equal
client.r+7	but ( it's not ) it's not stable because i mean it ( g* ) fades you know what i'm saying
client.r+7	and then i'm left with oh my god everybody's gonna know that i'm not making progress in my life
-	-
client.r+7	so ( that's gonna ) that's gonna keep me away from ( you know like the ) the merit that would warrant them ( uh ) investing in me some of ( uh their ) their valued assets
client.fn	which are ( like ) love ( you know ) or ( uh ) trust to ( uh ) divulge various information about ( you know their ) they're rooting for me you know what i mean or interest
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	i'm sorry i can't give you more like examples of ( uh ) traits character traits morals values
client.fn	because ( uh ) they should have already been there ( like ) honesty trust willingness those are all the things that ( you know mm ) would be ( uh ) kept well_guarded by them that i would earn through my actions you know what i'm saying
-	-
client.fn	all day long all day long this is all i do all day long
client.fn	and it's frustrating
client.r-2	so check this out if i go drink and smoke some pot i can do that from the easing comfort of my own home theater in the back of my mind because i don't have to be ( like you know ) this
-	-
counselor.res	your home theater in your mind when you're living in the shelter
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	which is the
-	-
client.fn	well right oh i know how it looks
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	you know what i'm saying
client.fn	but i mean what am i gonna do really tomorrow nothing
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
counselor.quo	what are you gonna do tomorrow
counselor.quo	what are you gonna do tomorrow that's different from today
client.fn	um
-	-
client.o-7	mm not a whole lot
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( um )
-	-
counselor.rec	even though you sound like you have this sort of goal to go to school in the fall and
-	-
client.fn	no no no see that's actually gonna happen
client.fn	because check this out it's been paid for by f_a_f_s_a
client.fn	filled out all the paperwork
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	if i don't get into school now i don't have ( the uh ) the hopes and dreams ( ash* ) aspirations behind me from ( like ) my father's
-	-
client.fn	uh
counselor.quo	and what will happen when they find out or like you say when you show up ( and they ) and they see that you're using the drugs
counselor.res	because ( you you you ) you do say you do recognize you've said this to me that some people see you but they don't see you because all they see is maybe the drug use and how you're acting
-	-
client.fn	that was pretty good that was pretty good
client.fn	hey ( um ) [clears throat] ( uh i'll ) i'll relinquish ( uh ) ( like ) i'll leave that
client.fn	okay here ( cau* ) because ( i ) i don't have that much time but ( um ) well maybe i do
client.fn	i don't think i could afford it for whatever reason i mean god takes somewhat ( uh ) [clears throat]
-	-
client.fn	( i will leave uh uh ) i will leave to the doubt of their mind ( uh ) the people that i am newly engaging with to ( uh ) determine whether it's more beneficial for me to go to school and then to have the potential assumption amongst themselves independently as to whether or not i'm doing drugs
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	just like let's see if he can get through this you know what i'm saying
-	-
client.fn	( that ) that'd be more valuable
client.fn	than let's somehow which is outside of their power keep inhibit this man from going to school because of a suspicion that we have
client.r+7	because i'm not gonna go in there ( you know ) to start school all fucked up you know what i mean
client.fn	i wanna be mentally prepared bright well_to_do easy enough you know what i'm saying
-	-
counselor.quc	mm-hmm and is that gonna include going in there using drugs
client.o+7	no
counselor.quc	on a daily basis
client.o+7	business business
-	-
client.o+7	first
client.r+7	( uh you don't ) you don't go into work ( you know ) all fucked up
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.rec	so
-	-
counselor.rec	at some point it sounds like then that you're gonna cut back before this class starts in the fall
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.r+7	( uh ye* ) well ( i ha* i ha* i can't ) ( go ) i can't go into school and expect myself to be able to function well
counselor.res	you have
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	which that was good that was good sorry
-	-
counselor.su	yeah yeah well derek i hope it works for you in the fall
counselor.su	i really really hope it works for you in the fall
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	( you know ) and it sounds like you've really really thought this through
counselor.rcw	i mean you do you have some really good goals and ( um ) you kinda know how to get there but ( uh ) i my only concern
client.fn	yeah yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	and may i express my only concern
client.fn	absolutely
counselor.rcp	is that you do it for show ( when you do s* ) when you do wanna straighten up you do it for show for other people and not
-	-
counselor.af	you've got all of these wonderful internalized thoughts
counselor.rcp	but when it comes to doing something that might get you to the goal ( that ) that it just feels like ( you're you ) you're able to put on the show you're able to do the show
client.fn	okay
counselor.af	and ( that's you know ) that's but if it helps you cut back that's good too
client.fn	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.gi	i mean i just
client.fn	can i ask you
counselor.gi	yeah
-	-
client.fn	oh what's the difference between
client.fn	( like i ) i hear what you're saying i think be like that it's a facade is what you're saying
client.fn	but how do i get to the point to where i can internalize those things
client.fn	because the way that i behave acting to show is ( like ) it is good and well received for a reason and i know that that i want to have whatever it is behind that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	but ultimately when that burns out then it's like i'm left with not being [du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	that's okay
-	-
counselor.rec	so you wanna know how to internalize it
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	and i think that's different for everybody
counselor.rec	but for some but you have internalized your beliefs your religious beliefs because those are really things that you want to live by or you want to attain
client.fn	right
counselor.quc	so somehow you've internalized those right
-	-
counselor.quc	( have )
client.fn	right
counselor.quo	how did that happen
-	-
client.fn	( um ) i dunno
-	-
counselor.gi	and that would be my guess is the same way you're gonna internalize the next step
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	whatever you however you've internalized the other goals and dreams your beliefs is the way you're gonna need to ( in* ) maybe internalize the next step for you
client.nc	[clears throat]
-	-
client.fn	yeah okay i hear what you're saying
client.fn	but ( like ) i can't retort because ( it's not ) it's not gonna get either of us anywhere but it's definitely something i have to think about
-	-
counselor.af	well that's good
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	and that's all that's all i that was my good suggestion or my mediocre
client.fn	yeah
client.nc	[clears throat]
counselor.gi	anyway so this is yours if you want it
counselor.res	but it sounds like you already
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah [clears throat]
-	-
counselor.gi	and this is some information if you would like this on programs around here that ( uh ) jessica left

counselor.gi	she told you that seven out of
client.fn	huh-uh
counselor.res	oh she didn't tell you that
-	-
counselor.gi	you scored a seven out of ten which means you have severe risk of some type from substance use
counselor.quc	( does that ring
counselor.quc	do you ) does that make sense to you
counselor.gi	we're talking ( like ) possible medical risk possible psychological risk

-	-
counselor.gi	and this is in the context of the substance use though
-	-
client.o+2	okay yeah i can see the substance use
counselor.gi	[du] [laugh]

counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-4	it's just horrible it's withdrawals they tell me but it's horrible
-	-
client.fn	and [du] ( you know ) i wasn't like that before that's why i used to get up and go to work every day of my life
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( since the ) since the shooting i was shot five times
client.fn	well since the shooting i mean because i'm thinking ( when i was here ) when i was here in the hospital after the shooting i would open my eyes they'd give me medicine i'd go to sleep
-	-
client.fn	so basically i was in a coma the whole time i was here a sleep coma you know
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
-	-
client.fn	i mean i would open my eyes five minutes and as soon as i [du] the nurse they come they give me some oxy i take it ten minutes and i'll sleep for another four hours
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	so it was good for four hours so they give it to you every hour on the hour ( you know ) you'll sleep the day away
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and then tomorrow it's another day and you're back at it again
-	-
client.fn	so they did me like that for ( like ) a month
client.fn	then i get home and i keep the same program
-	-
counselor.res	same ( same s* ) yeah okay okay
-	-
client.fn	because my wife used to work during the day and i was at home alone all day
client.fn	so i would just take the medicine go to sleep wake up take the medicine go to sleep wake up
client.fn	and then in time ( in time you know ) you start changing you stay up all night watching t_v reading a book you entertain yourself through the night
client.fn	and then you sleep all day and then you're up all night and you sleep all day you know
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah yeah vicious cycle

client.r-4	now you gotta wake up if you ain't got a pill you're in trouble
-	-
client.r-4	( you know ) if i ain't got no pill then your mind starts playing with you and oh man you need some you better find some you need something look find one and you start tearing up the house looking maybe you might find one
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah it's different you don't have the availability you don't have ( the ) the control you have when you're in the hospital

counselor.st	so ( um ) what we're gonna talk about today is ( um ) the ( uh ) questionnaire that you did specifically the ten questions that we call the dast
client.fn	okay
counselor.st	and ( um ) just kinda talk about where you're at with substance use
-	-
client.fn	okay gotcha

counselor.quc	do you want to know what your
client.fn	sure

client.fn	and what does that mean
-	-
counselor.af	( um ) that's a very good question
counselor.af	i'm glad you asked
counselor.st	because that was the next topic of conversation
counselor.gi	so the dast is a ( uh ) measure of risk
client.fn	[du]
counselor.gi	yeah it's a measure of a person's risk of suffering negative consequences as a result of their substance use
client.fn	and i see that
-	-
client.o+1	severe risk is six to ten that's me over the line isn't it
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah does that surprise you
client.fn	okay
counselor.quc	or does that seem like it's
client.o+1	no
client.o+1	it's
-	-
client.o+1	it's dead on
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+7	i'm just ( sur* ) yeah i mean it's dead on
-	-
counselor.quo	( te* tell me why ) tell me more about why you ( s* ) agree that that is right on that you're at high risk for
client.fn	um
-	-
client.fn	i've been to treatment one time last year in detox for the first time last year
client.o+1	and ( um ) yeah yeah i know i have a problem with it i know i do
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i was clean and sober for seven months
client.fn	( um ) i relaxed on march third and i've been relapsing since
counselor.af	that's great
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.r-1	and a large part of it was being homeless being kicked out of d_s_e
client.r-1	( um ) because some guys tried to rape me in the shower and i reported it and it got really ugly there and i'm banned so i had nowhere to stay except the streets
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so [cough] excuse me and my case manager over at sound_mental_health on capitol_hill basically did nothing
-	-
client.fn	( um they ) they couldn't do anything the lists are too long yada yada yada
-	-
counselor.rec	so you felt like you you were really out there on your own
client.fn	so i i i knew i was out there
-	-
client.r-1	i was on my own so i went to bars and did what i had to do
client.fn	and ( you know ) then i went home from ( uh ) a couple of weeks in march
client.fn	my dad his cancer is worse my mom's alzheimer's pre-alzheimer's she moved back up here with me

-	-
client.r-1	my i have no family and no friends nothing
client.fn	my mom went today to do this [du] ( um ) when she moved up here her job transferred with her they cut back her hours to nothing
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	we had to get [du] family_services to pay the rent
client.r-1	( um ) we're surviving on my three_thirty_nine three_hundred in food stamps right now until she gets some help
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( um ) she came [du] psych they told her there's nothing they could do basically see ya
client.fn	( um ) she went to ( uh ) swedish's e_r they said yeah you have a urinary tract infection on top of everything go home and take antibiotics there's really nothing we can do
client.r-1	( um ) i'm going through ( the own ) my own s_s_i process for a traumatic brain injury and other stuff
client.r-1	( um ) then i got gallbladder problems i had to have my gallbladder taken out two weeks ago
-	-
client.fn	i had an infection from that
client.fn	( um ) my social_security hearing was scheduled on april twenty_second in dallas i was sick with my gallbladder here and i couldn't go
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-1	( um ) there's mail from social_security apparently waiting to see what's happened whether i lost my case blew the hearing what
client.o-1	so yeah i have enough reasons right there
-	-
counselor.res	yeah yeah you have a lot going on
client.r-1	and when i have
-	-
client.r-1	to survive the way i have to survive
client.fn	and my case is being transferred from here to thither and yon and we moved to seatac so capitol_hill_sound can't see me ( um ) we're still waiting to get into tukwila my gallbladder slowed me down i have an appointment next wednesday
-	-
counselor.rec	so you are you do have housing now
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.fn	yeah and i'm not sure how to keep it
counselor.af	well good
client.fn	because i can't we can't afford the rent's seven_hundred_and_thirty_seven dollars a month and she's not working
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	three_thirty_nine plus three_thirty_nine ( is six ) is six_eighty
client.fn	so i mean it's not enough
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i don't know how we'll do it ( i don't i don't ) i don't know how we're gonna make it
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i don't know what's gonna happen
-	-
counselor.rec	so ( um ) and you use substances to escape this stress ( and ) and
client.r-1	yeah pretty much
client.r-1	because it's
-	-
client.r-1	yeah pretty much
client.r-1	and because if i go to a bar and have a couple drinks ( you know ) i can [clears throat] be entertained for some extra cash and entertain others for extra cash and then bring it home good evening
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-1	i don't deny it i admit it what do you want me to say
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like ( um ) and correct me if i'm wrong that ( you um ) you regret ( i ) i sensed some regret in your voice when you talked about ( relap* ) relapsing and about
client.o+1	yeah i regret relapsing
-	-
client.o-1	but i really don't know that i had a choice
-	-
counselor.gi	well and yeah and ( that's ) yeah that's
-	-
client.o-1	( i ) i feel that i don't yeah
counselor.gi	half of what i was gonna
-	-
counselor.gi	say
counselor.rec	that it sounds like you feel like things are too ( um ) unsteady right now and unstable too stressful for you to feel like you can get back to sobriety
client.r-1	yeah
client.r-1	right and
-	-
client.o-1	and what am i supposed to do am i supposed to leave ( uh ) a sixty_two year old woman who is unmedicated undiagnosed with alzheimer's fucking wandering around an apartment that may or may not be paid for while i go take thirty days of inpatient treatment i don't think so
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah well
client.fn	you know
-	-
client.o-1	that's just how it is
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know ) and when i'm living with someone who honestly that's what i deal with
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and then i deal with my own stuff and managing two people's lives plus a household and everything else
client.fn	( i ) i feel like i'm entitled i've begged the states texas forever two years for friends forever two years
client.fn	i've begged the state of washington to help for over a year
client.o-1	i don't feel that i'm under any obligation to maintain sobriety to be good for somebody
-	-
client.o-1	i don't feel i it i don't' buy it
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but
counselor.ec	well and honestly ( um ) any time a person chooses sobriety it's ultimately for yourself and not for anybody else
client.fn	right
client.fn	absolutely
client.fn	and right
-	-
client.c-1	now ( you know ) until thing mellow out that's how i'm gonna cope
counselor.fa	okay
client.o-1	i'm good with it
counselor.fa	okay
client.o-1	[laugh] [du] it sounds really mean of me but ( i'm ) i'm good with it
client.fn	does that make any sense
counselor.quo	why why
-	-
counselor.quo	do you say it sounds mean of you
-	-
client.o+1	because i know what i'm doing to myself i know the consequences of it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+1	i know i'm a six out of ten i mean i know it i rationally know it i emotionally know it i spiritually know it
client.r-a1	there's not a damn thing i can do about it today
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm okay so ( there is ) there is a lot of ambivalence in what you just said
client.fn	right
-	-
client.fn	there's the what can i do yeah
counselor.gi	and that's
-	-
counselor.gi	the question what can you do
counselor.res	so thirty day treatment is you've already done that
-	-
client.fn	yeah been there done that
-	-
counselor.af	and ( you ) you have the knowledge of a thirty day treatment program inside of you
client.fn	mm
client.fn	right
counselor.su	( um ) and the timing right now is not your life can't accommodate it ( and i ) and that makes sense
client.fn	no
client.fn	exactly
client.fn	right
counselor.quo	so i guess at this point ( um ) the question is not about whether you ( um ) are clean and sober or not the question is whether or not you're able to reduce your risk
-	-
client.o+1	exactly ( it's ) it's about stabilizing my life so that i can reduce my risk and become clean and sober again and maintain it like i was
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.su	mm-hmm ( and ) and ( um ) stabilizing your life is ( um ) gonna eventually get you back to sobriety
counselor.adw	but your life may not be stable and you could still reduce your risk in regard to your substance use ( if you c* ) if you choose to continue to use
client.fn	i know what you're saying
-	-
client.fn	yeah i hear what you're saying
-	-
counselor.ec	so my question to you is and you have the wisdom i don't have the answer for you
counselor.quo	( um what what is ) what can you do right now to reduce your risk
-	-
client.fn	doing the same thing i've been doing
client.fn	i've been staying out of the bars i've been staying away from people i know who use
client.fn	( you know ) i've been staying away from a lot of those situations
client.fn	i have found alternatives ( like ) last night i couldn't sleep [du] ( i had uh ) i had brownie fudge thing i had ice cream and hot fudge and a brownie ( i ) i know how to cook
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	then i went back up ( you know )
-	-
counselor.res	well and ( you know you're ) you're talking
client.fn	you know what i mean i'm finding
-	-
client.fn	alternatives
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-1	the problem that i have is that i don't know how to [sigh] without the proper medication and without the therapy without all of that other support structure in place staying sober's about doing a whole [laugh] hell of a lot ( you know ) because this stuff is not being dealt with
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.fa	mm mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and staying sober there's a difference between being sober and recovering
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and right now i'm not doing either one
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i'm trying very hard to do both
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-1	( it's uh ) it's practically impossible to do both right now
counselor.gi	well
client.o-1	and i don't know ( you know ) they say well you can't make good decisions when ( you're ) you're using that's not necessarily true
counselor.gi	and
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o-1	people are on medications all the time people are sedated in ways all the time they make great decisions that just kinda we're negating our own argument here for psychiatric medicine by saying it
client.o-1	so let's not kid ourselves people can make good decisions under certain circumstances of being altered chemically
-	-
client.fn	the question for me is would be at what point does my ability to distinguish that go away
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	you know what i mean
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	it's that teetering edge thing
counselor.gi	[du]
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	at what point do i slip off into f_it zone and just go full_blown ( you know ) just drink and never come back
client.fn	or ( you know ) drink and drive and screw it all you know what i mean
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.su	oh okay now i understand
client.fn	and that's why it's
-	-
client.fn	( that ) for me it's that teetering point
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i don't know how to pull back across the board from that teetering point
-	-
counselor.st	okay well ( um ) and ( um ) just to back up a couple steps about what you were talking about earlier
counselor.gi	i said ( you know ) you have the wisdom of what you can do to reduce your risk
counselor.res	and then you started telling me what you do you started talking about things that a person does when they're trying to maintain sobriety
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	and i wanna make a distinction between sobriety and harm reduction
client.fn	right
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	( um ) and you talked about being able to make good decisions
counselor.gi	i agree people can make good decisions for themselves when ( um ) they're actively using ( uh ) in order to reduce the risk of negative consequences
client.fn	right
client.fn	right
counselor.gi	so i'm not talking about not using
client.fn	right
counselor.gi	i'm talking about ( um ) in spite of your use ( um ) staying safe
-	-
client.fn	right and i'm working on that
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	there's yeah that's why i'm here for my appointment
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	that's why i went through my surgery
counselor.af	good
client.fn	and that's why i'm ( t* ) fighting the ( um ) that's why i'm doing what i'm doing
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know ) have i made the best decisions in the world lately no
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i know i've played some games and played with some fire that i should not have played with i totally agree
-	-
client.fn	in hindsight if things were different i wouldn't have done it
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	given and speaking [du] if that's okay at the time i made the choices i made for the reason i made them
client.fn	i can judge history all i want to looking backwards it doesn't have anything to do with going forward you know what i mean
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and so i'm looking at it from okay a financial bit i'm looking at it from ( the ) the components picture
-	-
client.fn	i'm looking at the spiritual intellectual emotional my psychosocial all of it i'm looking across the board
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	not just for me but as also someone who takes care of and provides them their all aspects of care for another
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah so you need to take her into consideration in your choices too
client.fn	exactly
client.fn	exactly
client.fn	and that's
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r+1	and that's one of the reasons that i am have stayed as well as i've stayed
client.r-1	but it's also one of the reasons i've used as much as i've used
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	if that makes any sense
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so until i find a way to negotiate all this i'm not sure that what's going to happen
-	-
counselor.gi	okay well
-	-
client.fn	and i just don't have everything that i need to negotiate it all
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	it's ( what ) what human being does i mean even under the best of circumstances one person cannot do all this
-	-
counselor.su	yeah everybody needs support
-	-
client.fn	yeah and i don't have it right now and i'm not sure where i'm getting it and i'm not sure how to get it and i dunno what's easier
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	and that's not about ignoring it that's about okay at what point do i just take out an insurance policy on myself so that she's taken care of find some people to take care of it and just blow my head off and call it done are they using the authorities
client.fn	i mean that's just where it is
-	-
counselor.su	well i think that we can probably find some solutions ( um ) before it gets to that point
client.fn	i hope so
counselor.quc	and so at this point i'd like to ask ( if ) if you'd be open to hearing some of my suggestions
client.fn	sure
counselor.af	okay so ( um ) first of all you're doing a lot of things it sounds like you're doing a lot of things well you're trying to stay hooked up with mental health care for yourself
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.adp	( and and ) and i wanna encourage you on that path ( uh ) follow up with sound_mental_health down
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	i've tried it's just honestly the gallbladder and the being in the emergency then having the surgery and ( the it's ) it's taken it's kept me from going
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and ( uh ) sarah ( uh ) jerome and i've had to reschedule and reschedule honestly because of the gallbladder
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	that's out
client.fn	( um ) i'm supposed to meet with her next wednesday actually next thursday
counselor.fa	right
counselor.af	that's great
client.fn	i don't foresee there should be a reason i should blow that appointment
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	the only thing that would keep me from going is not having the bus fare to get there at this point
-	-
counselor.gi	oh g_i_u should be able to help you with that
-	-
client.fn	i have three_hundred_and_thirty dollars going to everything else
client.fn	and their hublink hublink will get me there from what i understand
counselor.gi	[du]
counselor.gi	yes yes
-	-
counselor.adp	exactly okay the other thing that i wanted to mention is ( um ) when you do choose to go to bars and when you do choose to make extra money ( um ) make sure that you're practicing safe sex
-	-
client.fn	yeah i have been horrible with that ( that ) that isn't like me
client.fn	that's [du] [du] death wish
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	we have condoms in all our bathrooms
client.fn	i know
counselor.adp	take a handful
client.fn	i know
-	-
client.fn	and i do
counselor.af	good
client.fn	the problem is that i'm not caring
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	it's just ( like ) really part of me wants to die whether i wanted to or not
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	part of me is on wants something to kill me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( that's just ) that's just every all of it caving in on
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	if that makes any sense
client.fn	it's like this subconscious i want to die and i can't handle it anymore i'd rather be dead
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	so as much as i try to work it and everything else there's this part of me that's reminding all of it and that comes out with the unsafe sex the drinking the drug use and everything else
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i don't know [du] i never did if i did i wouldn't have been an addict to begin with
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	that's easy [laugh] if i had those coping skills i would [du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	now you say it's true
-	-
counselor.su	well and ( um ) are so i get what you're saying
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	( um ) are you at risk to ( um ) hurt yourself today or tomorrow
client.fn	no
counselor.af	no okay so again you're taking a step in the right direction by following up with your therapist
client.fn	and honestly i've decided
-	-
client.fn	to put myself on the lockdown sexually anyway
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i just had my last test it was negative on the thirteenth of may
client.fn	i've only had one partner since then and he's negative as well
client.fn	so i'm ( you know ) just gonna wait and see what pops up in august at this point
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.af	okay good so ( you've ) you've already taken steps towards
client.fn	i get tested four
client.fn	times a year
counselor.af	good
client.fn	and no
-	-
client.fn	less because i have a lot of blood draws and procedures and stuff like that so just make damn sure you know what i mean just make damn sure
counselor.af	good
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quc	okay ( um ) can you think of any other harm reduction ( um ) steps you might take
-	-
client.fn	well ( you know i have ) i have my couple of people that i talk to i journal a lot i pray a lot ( i you know ) i'm getting back into the church thing
-	-
counselor.gi	okay and those are all recovery practices and i'm talking harm reduction
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	yeah but there are some harm reduction ( as ) as well
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	because
-	-
client.fn	building that network of support and having somebody i can reach out to when the crap hits the fan does help so [du]
counselor.fa	right
counselor.gi	oh so that's what
-	-
counselor.gi	and that's
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) i don't we don't keep firearms around
client.fn	( you know i don't keep ) i don't keep alcohol in the house
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	there's a lot of shit i just don't do
counselor.af	good
client.fn	so ( you know it ) it would become one of those i'd really have to work at it to do myself in kinda thing
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so and if that's where it reaches [laugh] ( you know ) [du] i'd have to work at it so i know surely i would ( you know ) make the conscious choice to do something about it
-	-
counselor.quo	and ( what ) what would you do before
client.fn	exactly
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	what seriously what would you do before ( eh you ) you're at the point where you're ( um ) completely hopeless and hell bent on ending your life what steps would you take before
-	-
client.fn	( well i ) well i know yeah see the yeah ( i ) i know who i would pick up and call
counselor.quo	so far
client.fn	i know i would come here to the e_r the psych e_r here ( um ) which i've done i know i would call sarah i know i would call sound
client.fn	( um ) i have some friends back home that i would call and ( i ) i know what i would do
-	-
counselor.af	good okay
client.fn	and i know
-	-
client.fn	where i would go to keep my little butt away from all that
client.fn	i'd walk right up the street to denny's and sit there and wait on them or ( you know ) just ( you know ) get away for a minute
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i try real hard ( to ) to get out and walk every day to get out of the house every day no matter what
client.fn	to stay away from people and situations that i know will push the buttons
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	unfortunately i can't control the interior demons as well as i can control the exterior ones
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i wish i could
client.fn	and when i want to go and ( you know ) do something that's safer or better or more fun i don't always have the money i don't always have the freedom i just don't it's hard to balance all that
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i wish i did i don't ( i'm ) i'm doing the best i can do
-	-
counselor.af	you are doing the best and you're doing a lot of things to move forward
counselor.af	and ( um ) i think it's amazing actually ( um what ) what you're accomplishing given your level of stress
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	so ( um ) you're working on building a support system and that's one thing that you felt is not adequate
client.fn	it's not working
counselor.res	( but ) but ( you are ) you are working to build that up
client.fn	it's definitely lacking
client.fn	{ laugh]
client.nc	[cough]
client.fn	right
counselor.su	so things are not gonna stay this way forever
client.fn	no no
-	-
counselor.quc	( my ) my next question is have you applied for low_cost housing
-	-
client.fn	no i don't even know who to contact i don't even know the agencies or anything else
client.fn	we have our apartment i don't i know they're on a list i don't know how to qualify for it or any other things
-	-
counselor.res	they're on a list
counselor.quo	( who ) who ( what ) what
-	-
client.fn	( um ) we have we should we our lease is with the olympic_view_apartments out in seatac
client.fn	and they take subsidized housing vouchers and that kinda thing or low_cost vouchers i just don't know how to do all that or who to even call
-	-
counselor.gi	okay so in ( um ) outside of seattle it's king_county_housing_authority
client.fn	okay
counselor.quc	okay and ( um ) how old is your mom again
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) sixty_two
-	-
counselor.gi	okay so since ( um ) your mom is included in your family you'll qualify for ( um ) senior housing
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	( um ) and that's there's another housing group ( um ) senior_housing_assistance_group ( um )
client.fn	so is that
-	-
client.fn	do you have their numbers

counselor.gi	i do and ( i can ) i can give you those
-	-
client.fn	perfect
client.fn	see ( i ) i've had no social work help at all the entire year so i've been going through all this my case managers at sound have always said well ( you know ) it's really up to you to do it all
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but they never gave me the numbers or anybody to go to they won't give me any direction
client.fn	it was show up for group so i can sign your form and we'll talk we never talked yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	well ( um )
-	-
client.fn	kinda hard to show up to the groups when you're homeless [du] something to get stuff done that you need done
-	-
counselor.gi	so ( maybe ) yeah maybe ( um ) they need ( uh ) to be
-	-
client.fn	a little bit more proactive and hands on quite frankly
-	-
counselor.gi	( r* ) yeah ( and and ) and maybe they need to be
client.fn	[laugh] i'm just saying they can
counselor.adp	( um ) maybe you need to use a more directive approach i need housing help me get housing
-	-
client.fn	yeah i've done i've tried that having those conversations
client.fn	unfortunately you know how that goes

client.fn	okay cool
counselor.rec	( um ) and just to kinda summarize what we talked about today so ( you're um ) you're ambivalent about the fact that you're relapsed but you're not in a place right now to
client.o+1	i'm upset about
-	-
client.o+1	it
client.fn	i'm not really ambivalent ( i'm ) i'm kind of ( ac* ) passively active aggressive on that one
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	or actively passive aggressive on that one
client.o+1	i would love to not be using to the extent that i am
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+1	i would love to be more recovered and all that wonderful stuff
client.o-1	that's said i don't feel as much guilty about having a pitcher of beer or two when i go out as i do other stuff
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( um ) my failure to for example get a bed in the house or ( you know ) have her ( you know ) taken care of more effectively or more efficiently or what have you it's ( you know ) that stuff is bigger to me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-1	than damn a damn pitcher of beer
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-1	( my ) my other issues are far bigger than a damn pitcher of beer i mean honestly that's just how i feel
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i [du]
counselor.st	and and
-	-
counselor.st	( and and ) and as back to summarizing
counselor.res	( the the ) that ( you ) ( you you ) you've talked about how these bigger issues if they felt more under control then you would feel
client.fn	mm
client.fn	right
client.fn	right
client.fn	i mean if i'm gonna
-	-
client.o-1	go out ( you know ) and meet somebody or what have you and they wanna have a pitcher of beer and that's all they're buying then ( i don't ) i don't have a choice
client.o-1	( you know ) i mean it's when you're at the mercy of the world you're at the mercy of the world and so you eek out what you can eek out
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and if that offends ( the you know the ) the more elite groups and the [du] groups i'm sorry i have no time for this self_righteous hypocrite bull crap i don't i really don't
-	-
client.fn	( um ) that's just how i feel about it honestly
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	and i'm really kinda angry ( uh ) angered by a lot of it too
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i had professionals health care professionals look me in the face over the last year and say everything will be fine just as long as you don't use everything will be fine as long as you don't use
client.fn	i used for seven months in the seventh month of my recovery a professional ( a ) a healthcare professional looked me dead in the face and said ( you know ) if you relapsed you'd be getting more help
-	-
client.r-1	i said yeah i know so i fucking relapsed
client.r-1	it was the truth i've gotten more help since i relapsed than i did for the seven months that i was sober
client.fn	and that makes me even madder than anything else
-	-
counselor.gi	that's surprises me actually
-	-
client.fn	it's the damn truth
counselor.fa	mm-hmm yeah
client.r-	it is the damn truth i called the [du] rehab that i went to and they said well we can't get you in because of the budget cuts and everything and because you're still sober if you were to relapse we could get you in we could get you excellent
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-	i was homeless nothing and i was basically told if you use you'll get off the streets
-	-
counselor.quc	did that work
-	-
client.r-1	yeah damn sure did
counselor.fa	hmm
-	-
counselor.su	yeah that's not fair is it
client.fn	no
-	-
client.fn	it isn't
-	-

client.fn	sure
counselor.quc	and ( um ) when is ( you ) you said your appointment was on the eleventh with your

client.fn	two_zero
-	-
client.fn	six two_four_eight_six_eight_zero_one
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	and i'm sorry i don't mean to tear i hope i'm not being ( like ) aggressive with you or mean with you [du]
counselor.su	no no no yeah you're you're just
-	-
counselor.su	expressing your emotions about everything you're going through
counselor.gi	i'm not taking it personally ( i'm just ) i'm just
client.fn	i know i just hope you don't
-	-
client.fn	( and i ) and i want you to understand i also don't see this as a slight against the profession so to speak as social work or psych or medicine or anything else
client.fn	because it isn't ( it's ) it's somehow this existential argument for me it really is
client.fn	( um ) that's kinda why i was drawn to this book here i mean i'm not the devil
client.fn	what's that has to choose believe in god believe in the devil and which one do you serve
-	-
client.fn	and if this world belongs to the devil why not serve him but keep my heart where it belongs which is with god
client.fn	i mean what do you want me to say give in to caesar what has caesar given to the lord what is the lord's
client.o-1	and if that means that i have to drink and be a little bit rowdy and everything else to survive in this world i will
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-1	because it doesn't have to do with who i really am
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-1	and that's the only way i can balance this right now it's the only way
-	-
counselor.res	that's how you've ( um )
-	-
client.fn	held it together
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	it's the only way i can negotiate it honestly
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	is that ( you know ) if and i say this as a southerner ( you know ) [du] have to lie cheat steal or kill
client.fn	well ( you know ) if i had to steal i will if i have to lie i will if i have to cheat i will and ( you know ) i hope i don't have to kill anybody
-	-
client.fn	but [du] take what's mine at this point they don't need it
-	-
counselor.rec	especially yourself ( that that's ) ( i ) i think what you're saying is ( that's the that's ) that's to illustrate the desperation that you feel
client.fn	right
client.fn	exactly exactly
-	-
client.fn	right absolutely it means not ( you know ) it's not a it's i'm probably underestimating what i feel
client.fn	( i'm ) i'm probably lowballing how horrible i feel honestly
counselor.fa	mm yeah
-	-
counselor.su	well i'm hoping that we can help alleviate some of this stress
client.fn	yeah

counselor.su	( um ) and i know it's a lot of questions and took a lot of your time
counselor.af	so thank you
client.fn	oh
client.fn	it's not bad
counselor.quo	[laugh] ( um ) what did naomi tell you that we would be doing here today just the two of us
-	-
client.fn	( um ) she told me that it was ( uh ) research
client.fn	( um ) she's not saying this i'm saying this she said that ( uh ) how do i put it that we're you guys were doing a research to determine how ( um ) drug and alcohol abuse ( um ) what type of treatments would be needed to help a person with that
client.fn	( um ) that's pretty much what i got from it
-	-
counselor.gi	okay well let me elaborate a little more
counselor.gi	( um ) we're looking to see how ( a ) a brief conversation with ( a ) a trained ( um ) person ( uh ) whether it has any effect on someone's ( um ) health outcomes
counselor.gi	so drug and alcohol use is one of them the services that people use ( you know ) here at the hospital or treatment elsewhere ( um ) and different aspects of their lives ( um ) in terms of health and ( um ) employment social support
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.nc	[clears throat]
-	-
counselor.gi	( you know ) all of the things that naomi asked you about earlier basically
client.fn	right
client.fn	okay
counselor.st	( um ) so you and i are just gonna talk here ( you know ) for up to thirty minutes a quick conversation
counselor.gi	( um ) and i'm not ( s* ) here to tell you what to do or ( you know ) to make any changes
counselor.ec	if you decide to do that ( that's you know ) that's totally your call it's kind of on your own
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	i'm actually just here to learn more about you and ( um ) how drugs fit in your life and ( um ) kind of get ( a ) a picture of ( um ) how ( you know ) you like to use drugs or ( um ) things you like or dislike ( um ) really just be kinda like ( a li* ) a sounding board to listen ( um ) to how things work for you
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	so ( how does ) how does that sound
-	-
client.fn	that's fine
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	( um ) so naomi mentioned that in the past three days you've used ( um you s* ) you drank alcohol you smoke marijuana ( um ) daily
client.nc	[cough]
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o-2	shit i'm high now
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah [laugh] okay ( um ) and that you are prescribed opiates ( um ) but a few days you used more than your prescription and ( um )
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	vicodin's an opiate
-	-
counselor.gi	vicodin's an opiate
-	-
client.fn	hmm sounds so bad opiate [laugh] ( you know )
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.res	( um ) sounds bad
client.fn	[cough]
counselor.gi	that's interesting
counselor.gi	( um ) and that when you ran out of your vicodin prescription you used ( uh ) a friend's yeah somebody else's oxycodone
client.fn	oxycodone
client.fn	right
counselor.quo	okay so why don't you tell me ( um ) a little bit more about your marijuana use
-	-
client.fn	hmm it's daily
client.fn	( uh ) but ( it's ) it's more i would consider some of it [sigh] ( i would ) i would say as a whole my marijuana use i would say it's split up i would say it's split up
-	-
client.r-2	it's partially self_medicating
client.r-2	and the other part recreational
-	-
counselor.res	so for you marijuana is ( um ) sometimes medicine sometimes just to get high
client.fn	and
client.r-2	yeah for recreational
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	you know what i mean so it's kind of and with those two things right there that's ( like ) a lifestyle [laugh] you know what i mean so
-	-
counselor.rec	it's a daily thing for you that you're used to
client.nc	[cough]
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( you know ) i will ( or ) or maybe ( i ) i began self_medicating and ( um ) or started ( uh ) recreational and then ended up self_medicating
client.r-2	because ( i'm a really ) i was telling naomi i'm a really ( uh ) high strung person even at thirty_nine years old
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-2	i'm really wound up very active and that gets me in trouble a lot of times
-	-
client.fn	and ( um you know ) i'm great to have on a work site because i work the fastest and the hardest and i just keep going and going and going i can't sit still
client.r-d2	but ( uh um ) yeah ( i i i ) i like to smoke weed
client.r-2	because it ( you know ) i don't like to be like that all the time ( you know ) i like to be a lot more mellow
client.r-2	and when my mind is racing and i'm moving around so fast i kinda make bad decisions and things like that ( you know )
-	-
counselor.rec	so by nature you're ( like ) naturally really ( like ) fast_moving and ( like ) mentally physically and it benefits you sometimes ( like ) when you're working but you don't always wanna feel like that
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah but ( it's created ) it's created it's done more harm than good ( you know )
counselor.res	being that way
-	-
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	being that active has done
client.fn	right
counselor.res	so to fix that you've turned to marijuana because it calms you down
-	-
client.r+2	yeah but ( it ) [sigh] it just ( uh ) i think it calms me ( w* ) way [laugh] slows me way down too much you know what i mean
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.res	calms you down more than ( you ) you want
client.r+2	right
-	-
client.r-2	yup i wanna be mellow
client.r+2	but i don't wanna be high you know what i mean
client.r-2	i wanna be more relaxed and more [cough] patient ( you know ) it affects my level of patience ( my level of ) my level of ( you know ) just tolerance and things like that
-	-
counselor.res	so you like the way that it makes you calm ( uh ) gives you more patience and makes you tolerate more but
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	right
-	-
client.r+2	hm-mm but it also ( but ) but it makes me tired too you know what i mean i can't go to work
counselor.rec	makes you a little cloudy
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	kinda sedating
-	-
client.r-2	( you know my head ) my head my ( c* ) thoughts are clear they're relaxed and chilling ( you know ) i'm a lot more
client.r+2	but then i wanna go to sleep shit ( you know ) [laugh] it's like well that doesn't ( you know ) really it's not working out the right way [laugh]
-	-
counselor.rec	so on the one hand it's addressing ( you know y* ) your needs in terms of slowing down ( you know ) being more patient but on the other hand it's problematic and that you can't function the way you'd like to
client.nc	[cough]
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r-2	yeah and my rationale is well i am a lot more chill you know what i mean this is
-	-
counselor.rec	and right now that benefits you more than being too ( a* ) aggressive and active
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah yeah
-	-
client.fn	right right right
-	-
counselor.res	because that's gotten you into trouble before
-	-
client.r-2	yeah ( you know ) or just make bad decisions ( like i'm the ) i'm the type of person where i like to do everything the fast way i like to get things done if i'm on a job or if i'm helping somebody out ( you know ) and ( uh ) a lot of times if i'm when i'm not high and i'm sober and i'm moving and working real fast a lot of times i'll just say you'll ask me something i'm like yeah fuck it go ahead
counselor.res	just efficient
-	-
client.r-2	i didn't hear anything they were saying they asked me because my mind is just [sound effect] and i'm moving around
-	-
client.fn	you know
counselor.res	so much going on and trying to get stuff done
client.fn	yeah in my head
-	-
client.r-2	i'm just always ( you know ) i always have a song in my head i can always hear something in my head it's not voices no one's telling me to do shit but there's always noise commotion going on in my head and i'm always ( you know ) it's hard for me to focus on one thing
client.fn	i started on a medication called mirtazapine with dana my doctor
-	-
client.fn	and it was working good all that stopped slowed down i was able to read a book [cough] and actually retain the information after all these years
-	-
counselor.res	so you started taking medication to help with that
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	and that was from your p_c_p
-	-
client.fn	yeah huh who
-	-
counselor.gi	your primary care provider
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	dana
client.fn	right
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and ( um )
-	-
counselor.res	and it was working for you
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm it was working really good and all of a sudden it just didn't work anymore it still isn't
-	-
counselor.su	oh no
counselor.quc	so one day it just stopped working
-	-
client.fn	yup i mean i could ( read read ) read i was [cough] i started picking up books and reading
-	-
counselor.res	so you finally could ( like ) focus and take time and ( uh )
client.fn	you know
client.fn	i could
client.fn	i could focus and
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) retain information
client.fn	i'm thirty_nine years old i've never been able to do that
counselor.su	huh
client.fn	for first time in my life i was able to do that but now it's gone
client.fn	so ( uh er ) i think i've either well i've gone up since then i've gone up
-	-
counselor.res	so they've tried increasing the meds
-	-
client.fn	i started out at fifteen milligrams then thirty now i'm at forty_five
client.fn	i'm like well something's gotta but i'm
counselor.res	and it's still
-	-
counselor.res	not helping
-	-
client.r+7	yeah and i'm wondering if that has to do with my past drug use ( you know ) if that has created a barrier not a barrier but ( uh ) has it caused my tolerance for
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.res	do you wonder if maybe ( like ) your previous drug use affects the way your body's tolerating medications now
client.fn	yeah the way it would
-	-
client.fn	( normally uh bo* ) a person's body would normally tolerate it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+7	i wonder if my past drug use might be in the way ( you know )
-	-
counselor.af	yeah that's an ( inter* ) interesting question
-	-
client.fn	yeah can your past drug use affect you in a way to where ( m* ) medications that are prescribed for you won't have the impact it should have on you because of your past drug use hmm
-	-
counselor.res	so it sounds like you've been wondering
-	-
client.fn	that just that [laugh]
-	-
counselor.res	yeah just that exactly
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	( um ) hmm
-	-
client.r+7	because it does stuff to your body physically
client.fn	( you know ) for instance i used to smoke crack cocaine i've been clean for six years now and
counselor.af	that's
-	-
counselor.af	a really big change
-	-
client.fn	and ( um ) i'm thirty_nine i was thirty_six i mean thirty_three when i stopped
client.r+d8	( um ) but before that i hadn't stopped ( um ) i hadn't used i had tried other drugs mushroom and acid and cocaine powder or crystal things like that tried those things and i just didn't like it
client.fn	when i tried that [cough] i've been and that's another thing too
-	-
client.fn	when i was out there on the street getting high and stuff i'd been with people who had been smoking crack since the eighties and they were now sixty or something sixty year old men out there been smoking this since it first hit in the eighties
-	-
counselor.res	wow so you were around people who were heavy users
client.fn	they been smoking that stuff
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah who had been doing it for years
client.fn	i only started using it when i was ( um ) twenty ( s* ) six
-	-
counselor.res	so for about ten years or
-	-
client.fn	yeah and ( um ) i forgot where i was going with that ( um ) but yeah ( uh )
-	-
counselor.res	you used to like using crack
-	-
client.fn	yeah that ( um ) oh i was talking about my brain that's what it
client.fn	see i had a head injury in two_thousand_eight and i woke up two days later in this hospital on a breathing machine so my memory's all over the place
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( um ) so ( uh ) my crack use and stuff like that ( um ) i was talking about that
-	-
client.fn	and ( um ) oh there have been people i was out there with people that had been smoking to get high for ( twe* ) since they were twelve
client.fn	and i had only just started using it pretty much ( you know ) so i couldn't say that but
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	it's ( like ) new for you
-	-
client.fn	yeah but they were gone
client.fn	( you know ) they had been using it for so long that [clears throat] they would take a hit and walk down the street they would take their pipe and break it on the ground after they take a hit go walk down the street talking hollering screaming and cussing at themselves or somebody they thought was walking next to them
counselor.fa	hmm
-	-
client.fn	and ( um you know ) you go to their apartment or something like that to get high with them and they had all these medications ( you know ) that they were taking along with while they were getting high
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	that's why that raised the question to me is ( if ) even if you stop does it damage your brain in such a way that things can't take the right effect on you
-	-
client.fn	because if it messes up your memory and ( um you know your physical ) the physical part of it
client.fn	because a person that ( like ) me myself [clears throat] i've always been a short skinny person i've never been big
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i know other people out there like that but most of them most of the people i know that are of a ( r* ) average size let's say average being ( one_fifty to ) one_fifty to one_eighty
-	-
client.fn	if that's your natural body weight then and they started to smoke crack and getting high and everything well you start losing weight ( you know )
counselor.fa	right
counselor.res	[du]
client.fn	and then when you stop you don't even have to eat that much when you stop and you get clean and just putting food in your body and you get two times you get twice the size
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) i've seen people that have been about this big all their life start smoking crack and now they're like this you know what i mean oh yeah i mean huge to where they have ( breathing ) breathing problems and everything
counselor.res	they're real skinny
counselor.res	blew
counselor.res	up
counselor.nc	[cough]
client.r+7	so it has an ( uh ) drugs like that they have an effect on you those harder drugs
-	-
counselor.res	so they were fine at the time but then you stop using and then you when you stop using you have all these negative consequences
client.fn	yeah yeah
counselor.fa	huh
-	-
client.fn	they're negative that turn out for the positive let's just say
-	-
counselor.rec	so there was a reason to stop
-	-
client.r-a7	well when i say negative in a positive ( it's it's ) it's hard quitting drugs
client.r-7	because of the craving it's ( the ) the urges and things you have ( you know ) ( um ) withdrawals and everything
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+7	but it's positive or it is negative that turns out for the positive because in the end you'll be a lot more better off you know what i mean
-	-
counselor.rec	so you think you're better off not using
-	-
client.r+d1	yeah and smoking weed right now even though i just keep it to alcohol and marijuana even though i keep it to these two i still wanna be done with this shit you know god if
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so you've already ( like ) you used to use crack cocaine and you were running around with people who were so far gone you didn't want that for yourself
client.nc	[sigh]
-	-
client.fn	well i've smoked crack in these bathrooms in this hospital
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	i've slept [du] in the old emergency room i've slept out there in the old emergency room i've come into this emergency room with my feet so bad and that when i pull off my socks the skin comes with them
counselor.su	wow
client.fn	( you know ) it's i've been all over downtown_seattle i've been all over the u_district ( i've been ) i've been everywhere
-	-
counselor.res	and you've been everywhere
-	-
client.fn	just in ten years i've been ( you know i sp* uh ) i would spend ( like ) maybe a year or so in downtown and then i'd go up north and come back down here
client.fn	i was just back and forth
-	-
counselor.res	and this was when you were using crack
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	but something made you change ( and you don't use any ) and you don't use anymore
client.fn	well
counselor.quc	is that
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	no i don't i just keep it strictly

-	-
counselor.quc	me about that
counselor.af	( like ) that's ( like ) a really big change to make [laugh]
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	it sounds like you're at a very different place now picking up your girlfriend ( a c* ) a car and
client.fn	yeah
client.nc	[cough]
-	-
client.fn	well ( you know i am ) i am what do you call it uh i'm a christian
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	not actively practicing right now but i
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	but faith's important to you
-	-
client.fn	yeah it is my belief i believe in the lord
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	and i did a lot of praying and stuff
client.fn	and ( um ) one time after i have over fifty arrests on my record in king_county
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i've been to jail i have over ( fif* ) fifty arrests and sixteen or seventeen of them are convictions
client.fn	( um ) i used to drink a whole lot i used to smoke a lot of pot be dependent on people if they didn't have it for me i'd be
client.fn	just stupid stuff like that
-	-
client.fn	i've been all over this place
-	-
counselor.rec	so your legal problems were ( like ) a direct result of using
-	-
client.fn	yeah i mean i was just i was a wreck physically abused by my mom and dad growing up physically and verbally abused
counselor.su	sorry that must have been hard
client.fn	and ( um ) so i ended up out there
client.fn	and ( um ) there's ( uh i al* i ) whenever [du] say this whenever something goes bad or whenever i can't figure nothing out i would get scared of something first thing i do is get on my knees and i start praying
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	and so one time i was ( um ) one of the many times i was in jail praying again ( you know ) like god please deliver me from drinking and drugging and all this stuff
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( um ) i kept asking him i was like ( you know ) take this desire away from me the urge ( the ) the craving for alcohol and things like that okay
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and then ( you know ) people always say that god doesn't come when you call him but he's always right on time [laugh]
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	so ( uh i uh i uh i um ) i'm in jail and it just hit me after all these times
client.fn	i had been in jail before i was on probation for the use of crack cocaine and loitering in downtown_seattle many times
-	-
client.r+7	but right before my court hearing i just all of a sudden started having this feeling inside that i was done
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	you know i just kept and i told the judge i said you know what if you let me out right now i'm gonna go and get high i'm gonna go smoke some crack and i'll be here within the next couple weeks we'll be doing this all over again
-	-
client.r+7	i said but yeah i said i am so so sick of this so sick of it
counselor.rec	you knew
-	-
counselor.res	tired of the cycle
-	-
client.fn	i said i'm tired of looking at you guys ( you know ) i wanna break up you guys are like a relationship
-	-
counselor.res	[laugh] like a bad girlfriend
client.fn	you know
-	-
client.fn	i'm telling you ( you know ) i said i want a divorce [laugh] ( you know ) i'm sick of you guys really
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	and i told them i said don't let me out
client.fn	and they had a program in spokane at the time called a_b_h_s american_behavioral_health_systems in spokane ( uh ) they'd only been up running in fact for ( uh ) i think ( um )
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	i think it's pretty new when you started
client.fn	a
client.fn	a year
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	a year a year and a half
-	-
counselor.gi	it sounds really familiar
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and i told the judge i said all right send me there i wanna go there i heard it was only ( like ) twenty_eight days
client.fn	but i'd been out on the streets so many times in that ten years i was using i've been on the streets so many times
client.fn	and there'd be times when i wouldn't see the people i would normally get high with and then they'd pop up out of nowhere and every single time i'd say man where have you guys been at man let's go get high they're like man i just got out of treatment man give me a hit
-	-
client.fn	they'd come back to the streets celebrating treatment by getting high
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	but so many of them all the time treatment after treatment after treatment after treatment
counselor.res	the same people
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i knew one guy who had been to sixteen been to sixteen treatments
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	and ( uh ) that was my first i had never been there i didn't know what it was about
-	-
client.fn	i was expecting once i got on the bus and i got there and i seen a bunch of people ( recogn* ) familiar faces who i knew or just going to another treatment ( you know ) i was like shit what did i get myself
counselor.res	[du]
-	-
counselor.rec	they were gonna get out and start all over again
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( what like ) what did i get myself into
client.fn	i'm thinking i'm gonna go there and hear ( like ) people complaining about not ( you know like ) an n_a or a_a meeting ( you know )
client.fn	because alcoholics they do that there's one place in skyway in south_seattle where nobody likes to go to because all they do is sit there and bitch and moan they're just miserable from not drinking anymore it's just bad
-	-
client.fn	so that's what i was expecting to hear
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( that's the ) that's the criteria or their format i was expecting
counselor.res	so you went in
-	-
counselor.res	pretty pessimistic about it
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah ( you know )
client.fn	and ( um ) it turned out that their curriculum or their ( how ) how they did things it was ( um ) based on choice theory and behavior modification
client.fn	i had never heard of it i didn't know anything about treatment didn't know ( you know ) i was expecting to learn about okay marijuana's made up of this this and this and because of this this is what it does and this is what it does and this you know what i mean
-	-
counselor.res	so ( you ) you were expecting them to educate you
-	-
counselor.res	about
client.fn	drug education type of thing ( you know ) and ( uh )
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	but it wasn't like that
-	-
client.fn	yeah i'm like fuck i smoke that all the time i could've told you that ( you know ) i would expect this ( you know )
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	but it was ( um ) the way that it was and ( it made ) from the first day to the very last day it made so much sense to me you know
counselor.res	it was like a
-	-
counselor.res	perfect fit for you
-	-
client.fn	yeah and ( maybe ) maybe it's because i truly did wanna quit or maybe it's because it truly made sense
-	-
counselor.rec	so a combination of their program being a good fit making sense and the timing that you were just ready for a change but it worked for you
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	right
-	-
client.fn	( and and ) and i still think about it too i ( think ) think about it
client.fn	i don't ( i i ) i was never a person to tell anybody no ( you know )
-	-
counselor.quc	before that
-	-
client.fn	yeah my way of telling a person no it got ignored every time because my way if i tell a person no is in my body language
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	( you know ) and i already expect if you ask me something and ( i you know ) i don't wanna do it i just kinda go mm ( you know ) like that you know what i mean
counselor.rec	shrug shrug it off
client.fn	( i ) i would never just say no or i don't really never say anything
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( and um ) and it
counselor.rec	and you'd hope that
-	-
counselor.rec	that was enough
-	-
client.fn	yeah this treatment program yeah and it never was and i couldn't figure it out because i'm just a nice guy like that
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	well that program taught me how to just be okay with myself and to say no and why and consider the consequences ( you know ) no matter what state you're in and where you're at look around you and take inventory of your life it only takes a [snap fingers] quick second
-	-
client.fn	and ask yourself what should i do i really wanna do that i know just what's gonna happen if i do that i've been there before or i haven't if i
counselor.rec	and is it
-	-
counselor.rec	worth it to me
-	-
client.r+3	yeah if i haven't been there ( i ) i've seen people who've been on that stuff and look at them i don't wanna be like that
client.fn	it's just a quick it's like a computer ( you know )
-	-
counselor.rec	( dec* ) decision making
-	-
client.fn	yeah i mean you enter it in your database and you either hit enter or delete [laugh] ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	is it worth it is it not
-	-
client.r+1	right right right right ( you know ) but ( like i said ) like i said this alcohol and this marijuana is driving me crazy because i don't
-	-
counselor.rec	so for some reason that's a different beast ( like ) it was really easy for you to say yes or no to crack cocaine but now it's
client.fn	it
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o+1	yeah and i think ( uh you know you know ) now that i think about it talking to you i think you know what you just made ( keep ) let's keep talking because you're jogging my memory you're making my mind work here
client.r-a1	see i think the reason why it's so hard to quit
client.r-1	because it's those two drugs are more acceptable and expected among people
-	-
counselor.rec	socially acceptable
-	-
client.fn	you go to a bar you go to a club you go to a dance somebody's got some alcohol and some pot
counselor.su	alcohol's legal
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	and fuckin weed is here in a few minutes you know what i mean i mean really it's just right around the corner so
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	nobody thinks twice or questions that
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r-2	so ( you know s* and ) and when people have a problem with it they don't stop talking to you ( you know ) they don't change their phone number or anything like that you know what i mean
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.res	so it wouldn't affect ( your ) your social groups
-	-
client.r-a1	so that's why ( it's so ) it's so hard to quit
-	-
counselor.rec	so it is a different beast
-	-
client.r-2	and then everybody literally everybody and their grandmothers smokes weed now and drinks smokes i mean who don't who don't
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so you used to be around people who used crack and you didn't wanna be like them
-	-
client.fn	( i tr* ) i tried it in my house but my neghbor actually turned me onto it one time
counselor.nc	[du]
client.fn	and then i became a homeless or something and while i was homeless i ended up i was like oh yeah i've tried that before but it didn't work and i tried it and all of a sudden it started working
client.fn	and i was like it's the wrong time for this shit to start working when i don't have anything [laugh]
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	i'm out here on the street and voila it was already in the at that point
-	-
counselor.rec	so far deep into it
-	-
client.fn	yeah i was ( like ) in the toilet bowl right i'm swirling around right
-	-
counselor.res	( s* on ) ( your way ) on your way down can't go backwards [laugh] now that you're there
client.fn	now i'm stuck
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	all it took was just
client.fn	yup
-	-
client.fn	and once i took that first hit and it [sound effect]
-	-
counselor.rec	but you have you're no longer in that ( toil* ) toilet bowl but now you're in a place it's like you're in the bathroom and everyone in your everyone's in the bathroom ( you know ) using coke and
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah everybody's uses the bathroom
-	-
client.r-1	here ( you know ) it's very yeah it's casual you know what i mean
counselor.rec	it's normal
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	so i mean what do you do with that
-	-
counselor.rec	and you probably don't wanna change your social group ( you know like you ) you probably sit with your friends and
-	-
client.r-2	see ( that's ) that's another thing too i wanna disassociate myself with them but they're my friends though ( you know ) it's like damn how do you do that
-	-
counselor.quo	what ( i* ) why do you wanna disassociate from them
-	-
client.fn	because they don't the things i want in life aren't the things that they want
client.fn	and if they are if we do have a similar interest in mind the way they wanna go about obtaining them or reaching those goals or having those things isn't the same way i wouldn't recommend it ( you know )
-	-
counselor.rec	so you have very different kinda moral views and
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( th* th* ) they're more ( like ) either sell drugs and do this and that to get it or rob people or whatever or ( um ) collect social_security and food stamps and shit like that and eventually you'll get it but you'll always have a steady government check
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) fuck that
-	-
counselor.res	mm yeah that's not how you feel about
client.fn	you know
-	-
client.fn	come on man
client.fn	and these are my friends are my age i'm like what are you guys thinking man
client.fn	social_security i was like ( i ) my friend audrey i said man are you fucking serious ( uh ) did you just say that and he was dead serious
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like these are your friends now or just ( um ) people you have known for a long time have been through thick and thin they're not necessarily people you would choose to surround yourself with
client.fn	come on man
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( if if ) if i have a problem that's one thing i will say they're a different kinda friend
client.fn	because when i'm going through something i don't call them you know what i mean when i really need to just sit back and kick back and just talk to somebody or someone to listen or ( uh ) i just need somebody to ride with me and not say nothing they're not who i call [laugh]
counselor.fa	huh
-	-
client.fn	no because
counselor.quc	but you have other people that who ( f* ) fill that role for you
-	-
client.fn	yeah that i can talk to on the phone pastor of my ( ch* ) church which i haven't been to in a while and ( uh ) some other people
client.fn	but i can never get together with them when i need to the way that i want to the way that would be beneficial for whatever i'm going through so i end up going to
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	defaulting
-	-
counselor.rec	to these buddies
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( you know and and ) and it always ends up on smoking weed and i ask a question
client.fn	it's like i'll i won't tell them what i'm going through they'll know something's wrong and i'll just ask them a question in regards to that or what i'm going through i'll ask them a question it'll be the same concept but not the same deal you know what i mean to see how they're gonna react and what they're gonna say
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and every time i just end up either going like this or just slap myself on the leg
counselor.rec	shaking your head
client.fn	[du] didn't dumbass ( you know like ) come on
-	-
counselor.quo	mm what are your friends ( um ) what's their drug use like
-	-
client.fn	theirs is like mine alcohol and pot
-	-
counselor.res	so they don't use crack anymore okay
client.fn	they don't
client.fn	no
client.fn	um
-	-
client.fn	so a couple of them ( s* ) they sell weed a couple of them sell dope
-	-
counselor.res	okay so it's pretty
client.fn	you know
-	-
client.fn	but they have families they have a home they have a car and things like that ( you know ) their head is just yeah they're not
counselor.rec	functioning
-	-
counselor.rec	for the most part
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( you know )
counselor.res	but again
-	-
counselor.res	( like ) not going about it the way that you
-	-
client.fn	that i would ( you know ) ( i i ) ( i i wanna i ) i wanna be i wanna have an honest life i wanna be an honest person i wanna have
counselor.res	would want to
client.fn	i'm not worried about what people think about me but i care about people meaning i don't care if they care that i care about them i'm still gonna treat people nice you know what i mean
counselor.rec	you just wanna ( like )
-	-
counselor.rec	live authentically
-	-
client.fn	yeah i just ( you know )
counselor.rec	genuine
-	-
counselor.rec	to what you see your life being
client.fn	huh
counselor.rec	you just wanna live the life you see and just envision for yourself
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) and ( you know ) the things that i get in life and how i get there ( i want ) i want it to be clean ( you know ) ( i don't ) i don't wanna ( um )
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.rec	just to have an honest life never have to worry about the things that you used to have to like look over your shoulder like you used to or
-	-
client.fn	i'll tell you what i'm gonna challenge you to do something
client.fn	when things are going really good for you or you're feeling really good about living an honest life on a day like this if you're walking on the street and it's really quiet just smell the air it smells different ( you know )
client.fn	it's the weirdest thing i can't explain it
-	-
client.fn	but when i'm doing things the right way and ( uh ) there's a different air it's weird
-	-
counselor.rec	you can ( like ) sense it with every part of your being
-	-
client.fn	you can sense it and you can hear it ( it's just ) it's just the nicest thing and that's what i want ( you know )
-	-
counselor.res	yeah it sounds like a
-	-
client.fn	that's what i want
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like you have a really solid idea of what you want for yourself
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	what would it be like
-	-
client.o+1	this stupid weed and alcohol is just god man it's
counselor.gi	um
client.fn	i mean
-	-
counselor.rec	( in* ) interfering with your vision of your future
client.r+1	it really
-	-
client.r+1	is ( especially for es* ) especially financially ( you know ) and
counselor.res	so not only
-	-
counselor.res	do you not you don't picture a life with alcohol or weed but it's also affecting the financial picture it's expensive
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+1	( i ) i can't ( like ) the things i want in life where i wanna be in five years ten years or where i just wanna end up in general i'm convinced that it's not possible
-	-
counselor.rec	with these things
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	so you can't get there with alcohol or drugs in your life
client.r+1	no
-	-
client.r+a1	i can't and i know it that's why it's so important for me that's why it was totally necessary that i did this with naomi yesterday ( you know ) i can't i can't
client.fn	and ( you know ) the thing about it is that i'm not when i drink it's two sixteen ounce cans at the most a day
client.r+1	( you know ) being the reason why because physically my body can't handle it anymore
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i was hospitalized here i have a i had a hernia and ( i have po* ) i have polycystic kidney disease which is hereditary
client.r+2	so depending on how i take care of myself i might take my next breath and die or live to be a_hundred it's up to me ( um ) so ( uh )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so for you two sixteen ounce cans is like it's pretty minimal
-	-
client.fn	yeah and then i had that head injury where i got jumped on by all those people
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	they stunned me in the neck with a taser gun and five guys kicked me in the head i guess or whatever
counselor.res	and you woke up
-	-
counselor.res	here
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r+1	so ( you know ) once i get a buzz that's it anything else and [sound effect] down i go
client.r+d1	and i don't like the feeling of the spins and the alcohol ( you know ) being drunk ( you know )
-	-
counselor.res	you don't even like the feeling of it
client.fn	hm-mm
counselor.fa	okay [cough]
-	-
client.r-1	so it's really just an accessory to my pot really just beer
counselor.res	they go
-	-
counselor.res	hand in hand
-	-
client.fn	yeah you know what i mean
-	-
counselor.rec	so you probably wouldn't drink if you weren't smoking pot
client.r+2	yup
-	-
client.r+n1	yeah these two things they've ( got ) got to stop they gotta stop
-	-
counselor.quo	so ( what would s* ) what would that look like for you
-	-
client.fn	what would that look like for me
counselor.quo	yeah what
-	-
counselor.quo	would stopping look like
counselor.quo	what would that involve
-	-
client.fn	( uh well ) well that's a good question what would it look like
client.fn	if i stopped right now ( i i ) i
-	-
counselor.quo	( like ) what would it take to do that
-	-
client.fn	i think it would take ( um )
client.fn	see ( the thing with ) the thing with crack is that it broke me i mean i don't mean financially ( it ) but it broke me ( like uh ) morally ( you know the things the ) the things i compromised ( you know ) just the
counselor.rec	( like ) you just weren't
-	-
counselor.rec	the same person when when using it
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) and ( um )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	but alcohol and marijuana are different because you're still able you're still yourself for the most part you're still able to function for the most part it's socially acceptable
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	but it's ( um ) see crack is ( like uh )
client.fn	god i'm trying to remember what i was gonna say ( uh ) at the beginning i forgot
-	-
counselor.gi	i'm sorry i probably interrupted
client.fn	mm
-	-
client.fn	no no you didn't
client.fn	i forgot what i was talking about while i was talking [laugh]
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.su	i do that too [laugh]
client.fn	jeez
counselor.rec	( um ) well i imagine with crack ( um ) you're probably not around it as often anymore
client.fn	uh-huh
counselor.res	because you mentioned ( your ) your group of friends mostly use alcohol ( and ) and pot
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	( um ) so what would it be like to try and avoid alcohol and pot when everyone you are with use alcohol and pot
client.r-1	uh it'll be
-	-
client.r-2	impossible to avoid
client.o+1	so i would have to [sigh]
-	-
counselor.quc	so you couldn't still hang out with them and just not ( um ) use as often
-	-
client.fn	i have before but one ( i ca* ) but i can't hang out with them i have to run by and say hello and bye
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so you tried that but you just can't stick around long enough because ( you'll want ) you'll wanna use again or they will give you a hard time
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r-1	yeah definitely
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	so that's not an option that's been down that road
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o-1	yup so ( i would have ) i would have to conmpletely disassociate myself and
-	-
counselor.su	i could see that being a difficult choice to make if that's ( you know ) those are your people ( uh ) the people you're around all the time
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o+2	yeah ( i just uh ) for some reason i just think it'd be different now
client.fn	because ( well i ) well ( i have ) i've done it before but i didn't do it intentionally so it happened that way
-	-
counselor.quc	not associating with these people
-	-
client.fn	yeah it just sorta happened that way and i was like oh cool
-	-
counselor.rec	because you're ( like ) busy with other stuff
client.fn	yeah so
counselor.res	but it was never intentional
-	-
client.fn	i think i had that in one of my prayers to the lord and guess what just make me a little more busy [laugh]
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	( you know ) give me something else to do ( you know ) next day i'm like no that wasn't enough i need something else
-	-
counselor.res	[laugh] so for you a big thing will be ( you know ) if and when ( dec* ) you decide you wanna try not using marijuana or if you wanna start a life without marijuana or alcohol a big thing for you will be changing who you're surrounding yourself with
client.fn	mm-hmm yeah
counselor.quo	[clears throat] what else would affect using do you think
-	-
client.fn	would affect it
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah ( like ) besides just the people you're around
client.fn	( um )
-	-
client.fn	you know what hmm i think it's my attitude
client.fn	check this out so the first time i took that medication it settled me down
client.fn	i mean i was fine i was happy i was clear_headed i could concentrate i could focus and my brain was quiet
-	-
counselor.rec	it's an exciting time
-	-
client.fn	and i was so content and i remember telling myself man this is oh there's a lot of ( lud* ) lucky motherfuckers out here [laugh] if this is the way it is i was like man there's just a lot of you motherfuckers are lucky out here man
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	i'm telling you this is fucking not normal it was weird
-	-
client.fn	i was like man this is nice i was so calm and i didn't hear anything i always have a rhythm a song something somebody's saying i can hear what's going on out there ( you know )
-	-
counselor.res	it's a constant distraction but that took it away for you
client.fn	shit
client.fn	you know
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	okay but what about your attitude you mentioned
-	-
client.fn	my attitude ( um )
counselor.nc	[cough]
counselor.rec	you were happy
-	-
client.fn	my attitude oh ( i ) yeah i was fine i was content
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i remember thinking to myself well ( like ) i could probably go and hang out with the guys and get high but ( i'm ) i'm cool man i'm gonna go do this instead [laugh]
client.fn	( you know ) i'll go do a chore or something ( you know ) go work on my car or ( you know )
-	-
counselor.rec	had some motivation to go do something
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( and wa* ) and was completely fine with it ( you know ) even turned a couple people down now i'm like nah i'm cool you guys go ahead and drink without me you guys go ahead and do this without me i was completely fine
client.r-2	but now that i'm not i find myself running to marijuana because it's not like that anymore ( you know )
-	-
counselor.rec	so it's like because you're not getting the same effects from the mirtazapine ( you ) you're turning to marijuana because it
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+2	yeah ( it d* and and ) and it doesn't take it away it either
client.r-2	it just calms me down so i'm more able to cope with not the fact that i can't have it the way i ( d* ) had it [laugh] ( you know ) so
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	it's like a pacifier kinda
-	-
client.fn	right ( can i ) can i give her a call real fast
-	-
counselor.nc	yeah let me pause it
-	-
counselor.res	so because the mirtazapine hasn't been working marijuana's been kind of a temporary fix
client.r-2	fix
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	so it sounds like in the past you've explored this issue with your doctor ( um ) she's always prescribed something to help out
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	( um what is it ) what has that been like lately because it hasn't been working
-	-
client.fn	well i have another doctor's appointment in two months three months
client.fn	so i'm gonna talk to her then i'm gonna go one more month with this how many milligram
counselor.res	the the new dose
-	-
client.fn	yeah and ( um ) yeah if by then it is still the same then we'll just tell her ( we ) we have to increase it or switch to something else because it's driving me crazy
client.fn	it's driving me crazy because i was so amazed at wow shit this is different
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) it was the weirdest thing because for so long so many years all my life whether i was high whether i was on the street whether i was in a hospital or something like that i always used to say to myself man what the hell how come i can't focus
client.fn	( you know ) and it used to drive me crazy and i always just used to imagine
-	-
counselor.res	because ( like ) suddenly ( e* ) everything was calm and clear for once in your life the first time in your life
client.fn	yeah right yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah i mean it got to a point where ( uh ) going from the time of birth not even having any idea why i was like that not having any clue or anything
client.fn	shit i started to think it was normal you know what i mean
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	mm-hmm hmm ( what has ) what has your ( um ) marijuana and mirtazapine use looked like together
client.fn	boy was i wrong
counselor.gi	i'm curious about that
-	-
client.fn	now i'm curious about it yeah because
-	-
counselor.quc	do they go hand_in_hand for you
counselor.quc	or when you're using mirtazapine do you not use your ( marajua* uh )
-	-
client.fn	i would like to get a professional answer and an opinion i would like to get a professional answer on that
client.fn	because i wonder having asked the question earlier previously ( or ) or earlier in the discussion that if i view something then i stop may will i damage something to where it can't take effect anymore
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	may i share something i've learned about that
client.fn	mm
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm yeah man absolutely
-	-
counselor.gi	this came up ( um uh ) with somebody else and so i asked ( uh ) one of the doctors on our study ( um ) if ( you know ) previous drug use would affect certain things later in life if they stopped drug use
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	and he seemed to think that that's not the case
client.fn	really
counselor.gi	( um ) and he's the addiction specialist over at ( um )
-	-
client.fn	( he said ) he said that's not the case
counselor.gi	h_m_h_s
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) that yeah people can stop using drugs and then ( you know ) they're they can go back to functioning before they were using
-	-
client.fn	no shit huh
counselor.gi	um so
-	-
counselor.adp	but if it's something you're concerned about ( you know ) ( um ) i'm wondering if it might be worth bringing up with ( your um ) your primary care provider
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	what do you think
client.fn	right
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah i will
-	-
counselor.quc	you think that's something you could talk to your primary care provider about
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	you guys are pretty open
-	-
client.fn	yeah he's the one that prescribed the medication for me
counselor.quc	about that stuff
client.fn	i talked to him about it and he said well we'll try this so i got on that
-	-
counselor.res	so he's been pretty helpful
-	-
client.r+2	mm-hmm i just ( um ) well now that i think about it i think it's pretty obvious that considering [laugh] marijuana's reputation and characteristics i don't think that it should go with anything alcohol or any type of medication because it's such a heavy downer or can be
counselor.res	like sedating kinda
client.fn	yeah you know what i mean
-	-
counselor.rec	makes you cloudy
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	[clears throat] so it's possible that
-	-
client.r+2	so you but you ( eh i ) i would see it as [laugh] marijuana being ( like ) a heavy blanket ( you know ) [laugh] and ( you know ) like little kids you try to push this thing off you so you can get up [laugh]
counselor.fa	oh yeah
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.res	just drowning in this blanket
client.fn	yeah you know
-	-
client.r+2	yeah jesus
-	-
counselor.rec	so for you it might be a combination of the mirtazapine and the marijuana that maybe isn't as effective as it used to be
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and ( you know some people ) some people would say ( you know ) that sucks because that'd be cool to be able to smoke weed and take your medication together ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	i can imagine
-	-
client.o+2	but nah fuck that hell no
-	-
counselor.rec	( you're s* ) you're so far done with marijuana
client.c+2	yeah i'm s*
-	-
client.r+d2	i just i want ( i i ) i talk about being so far done but i want to be completely and physically done with it
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+2	( you know ) i'm sick of it
-	-
counselor.rec	well we've talked about ( like ) it sounds like marijuana had a place for you and currently has a place as this blanket safety net comforting but not helping you
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r-2	safety net [du] you nailed it pretty much
-	-
counselor.res	( um ) but you wanna be done with it completely
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( i you know ) because and i thank god for this too because it seems that all i needed and i think that some people and hopefully there's more people in these shoes ( um ) than not but ( um )
counselor.nc	[cough]
client.fn	i forgot what i was saying again where was i what was it
-	-
counselor.res	you were saying you were so thankful
-	-
client.fn	about ( um ) oh because sometimes ( um ) my life i've always ( been ab* ) been abused mentally physically and stuff like that growing up
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.su	you've been through so much
-	-
client.fn	i've been through so much
client.fn	and then with the drugs and everything ( ha* ) having been through so much that was ( like ) a drug already because my mind wasn't focused on the things that they should have been focused on school life ( you know ) maturing and becoming a dad all that stuff
-	-
client.fn	had all this other shit going on and then i just went straight from that to the drugs
client.fn	so ( i ) it's like i never had a moment where i was at peace that i was calm and i could think straight right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i was always on drugs or involved in some shit so just for a brief period of time i had a little exposure to having a clear head to being sober
-	-
counselor.rec	so you're finally getting this clarity
-	-
client.fn	well i had that and then it's like oh so i've been here i had a taste of this so now i'm choosing this you know what i mean
client.fn	i tried this i tried this even though i just had ( a little bit of ) a little bit of exposure to that
-	-
counselor.res	to the clarity
-	-
client.r+7	that's enough to make me say screw all this shit
-	-
counselor.res	you want that back
client.fn	you know
-	-
client.fn	that's where i'm at right now ( you know )
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so you're at a place where ( you're ) you're ready for that ( you've you've ) you probably appreciate that clarity more because of everything you've been through and having never had that ( you know ) for the past forty years with everything you've been through so
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	hey ( i'm ) i'm forty i'll be i'm thirty_nine ( uh ) i'll be forty october twenty_eighth
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	check this out and this is this drives me crazy at thirty_nine years old i look at myself and what i'm doing now where i'm at in life i really don't know where i'm at and i really don't have a thing to show for it
-	-
client.fn	and i think about my dad ( you know ) i remember when my dad was my age i had everything i wanted i had a good childhood growing up minus ( the ) the abuse and everything like that
client.fn	but i always had all my toys i always had everything for school pictures picnics field trips ( um ) if i wanted
counselor.res	so everything was
-	-
counselor.res	at your fingertips you're ( like ) financially secure didn't never had to worry about a roof over your head
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	if i wanted to play
-	-
client.fn	if i wanted to play community soccer or something like that or if i wanted to if everybody was going up skiing and stuff like that and ( you know ) kids were learning to ski i would get a pair of skis too or something ( you know ) but i ended up snowboarding
counselor.fa	wow
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( um you know ) three cars three_car garage huge house ( you know ) and ( um ) when in the summertime he would always add onto the house you know what i mean
-	-
client.fn	he my dad was doing things like that he wasn't smoking crack he wasn't gambling he wasn't hanging out with his buddies drinking beer talking shit you know what i mean
-	-
counselor.res	so he
-	-
client.fn	and i think about that i'm like man that's where i've always wanted to be but never knew how to get there because i had all this other stuff going on
client.fn	and ( uh ) when i had all that other stuff going on i went from that to the drugs ( you know )
client.r+d7	and then got off ( you know ) got out of that situation left the drugs alone for a while got my head clear and ( i ) i liked it
-	-
client.r+7	fell in love with it and i was just like this is what i've been talking about the whole time [laugh]
-	-
counselor.rec	and now you can see how you can get to where you want to be
-	-
client.r+n1	yeah ( and i ) and i just i need to [du] this alcohol and this weed i really do i really do
client.o-2	i'm gonna go out here in the car and smoke some weed right now as soon as we leave here
client.o+2	that's how bad it is that's how much weed i smoke ( you know ) but it's
-	-
counselor.res	so you want it so badly that ( um )
-	-
client.o-2	but ( if ) if i don't do it
client.fn	and right now i don't have anything to do ( you know ) i'm not working today or i don't go back 'til monday or tuesday and so ( um ) and i don't really have anything to do
counselor.res	long weekend
client.o-2	if i'm not at work then
-	-
counselor.rec	it's really easy to fall back into that
-	-
client.fn	yeah and most of them well actually all of my friends except for one are unemployed ( you know )
-	-
counselor.res	but you're you have a job
-	-
client.r-7	yeah and they're always ( you know ) if i ever wanna waste my life or waste some time they're always there oh yeah what are you doing oh nothing right i'll come over okay i'll see you when you get here it's that easy
client.o+7	( you know ) and to have it that easy have that type of shit at your fingertips isnt good ( you know )
-	-
client.o+7	so i'm working on it we'll figure it out
-	-
counselor.ec	yeah it sounds like ( um you know ) if it's a change you wanna make you have the willpower to do it the ( f* ) you've done it for crack
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	oh that's my lady
-	-
counselor.quc	okay you wanna take that
counselor.gi	oh no [laugh] gotta make sure that's
-	-
client.fn	yeah nobody's home oh my god [du]
-	-
counselor.res	make sure nothing's on fire
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	okay well i just want to see if i can summarize it sounds like to me ( uh ) you want to be done with marijuana and alcohol ( um ) you've ( m* ) already made some pretty big changes in your life having stopped using crack
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.af	( um ) so if and when you decide you're really ( reali* ) ready it seems like you definitely have this the willpower and your faith and strength to ( um you know ) make those make changes
counselor.rec	( um ) but we've talked about how other things in your life would have to change ( um ) it sounds like your social group right now would make it really difficult to stop
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	( um ) and it's i know we also explored the idea of ( um ) i know you mentioned you might wanna talk to your doctor ( um ) to see what he thinks about ( you know ) the marijuana and the mirtazapine if that's ( uh ) affecting how the mirtazapine's working or not
-	-
client.r+2	mm-hmm i'm pretty sure it is
-	-
counselor.res	but you think it is
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.adp	but it might be worth exploring with him just in case
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	( um ) and then moving forward you're just gonna kinda see how it goes ( um ) but there's no real plan at this point to you know stop or anything anytime soon [clears throat]
client.fn	right
-	-
client.o+7	no shit there is sooner the better
-	-
counselor.res	there is so you'd like to stop
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o+7	if you had a pill right now that could make me stop i'd take it right now without even i'd snatch that thing and take it right now i really would that's how serious i am
client.r-a7	but it's just hard for me to do on my own
counselor.fa	right
client.r-2	and ( you know ) i don't really have anybody to tell me not to smoke because they all smoke [du]
counselor.quc	would that be
-	-
counselor.quc	helpful for you
client.r+2	well my pastor and
-	-
client.r+2	everybody they tell me
client.r-2	but i don't go to church anymore
client.fn	this is ( you know ) that's the other thing too is that church its support group and everything but for crying out loud man i just ( um )
-	-
counselor.rec	you can't be going to church every day
-	-
client.fn	no it's not that it's ( um ) they don't like to do shit they don't like to do anything
client.fn	they're either at work or at home or at church and that's a little dry to me [laugh] ( you know ) so
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	so you wanna have more of a life outside of
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah and ( that's where ) that's where those two worlds collide
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	okay so we've talked about some options
counselor.quc	can i share some other options that people have ( um ) tried themselves or talked about with me
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah i'm getting worried now because she's now she's calling me and flipping out and everything
counselor.fa	oh okay
-	-
counselor.gi	okay well this can be really quick ( we ) we don't have to talk about it all
client.fn	yeah
counselor.ec	and it's totally your call
counselor.gi	because we have ( um you know ) gone over a lot of stuff today so
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	but if you'd like to hear i can share a couple other options moving forward
client.fn	yeah
counselor.adp	( um ) so one option is to not make any changes ( um ) and just keep using the same way that you have been
-	-
counselor.res	but it sounds like that's not really what you wanna do
client.r+d7	no
counselor.gi	okay so that's we'll take that off the table
counselor.adp	( um ) another option would be to ( um ) cut back use a little less than you usually do ( um ) or use in situations that might be safer for you like ( you know ) maybe not when you're working but on the weekends only or
counselor.gi	i don't know what that would look like
-	-
counselor.adp	( um ) another option would be to ( s* ) seek treatment
client.fn	mm
counselor.res	you've been through that before for the crack
client.fn	mm
counselor.gi	i dunno if that would be helpful to you marijuana or alcohol but it's always an option
counselor.gi	( um ) i know there are more options than this for some reason i can't think of them okay
-	-
counselor.adp	keep using not doing anything oh quit completely just cold turkey stop entirely ( um ) cut back seek treatment
counselor.quc	is there anything i've left off that is a potential option
-	-
client.fn	no that was four
-	-
counselor.quo	okay so those are what do you think about all of those
-	-
client.r+n7	i think it'd have to be the very last one stop completely cold turkey
-	-
counselor.res	cold turkey
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( i i ) because i think i'm more of a person where i use ( a l* ) a lot of analogies when i talk
client.fn	i don't know if you've noticed but
-	-
counselor.af	yeah i like it
counselor.res	toilet bowl
-	-
client.fn	( i um ) i would compare i would say it'd be like i'm the type of person to when i go swimming i won't put my foot in the water
counselor.res	dive in
client.fn	yeah but i'll sit there and i'll look at it first ( you know um ) and ( like ) you know what i mean i have to like with quit
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.rec	you have to
-	-
counselor.rec	be ready and then you'll go and then you'll jump in
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	but i'll have to wait
-	-
client.fn	for something to happen you know what i mean
client.fn	( like ) somebody do something ( you know ) to make me jump in the water you know what i mean
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.res	so you're not going to walk in ( like ) an inch at a time
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( and that ) and ( that would be the s* ) that would be equivalent to slowing down you know what i mean
counselor.res	cutting back
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	so you know that that won't work for you
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o+7	no it has to be cold turkey it'd have to be all or nothing ( you know )
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	and for you you see that without help from other people
-	-
client.o+7	with help from other people yeah with help
counselor.rec	with help
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quo	what would the help
client.fn	i'd have to i
-	-
client.o+7	i'd have to say look today i'm quitting for good for the rest of my life now i'm gonna be an asshole [laugh] ( you know ) but i'm telling you right now so this is what we're gonna do because you guys are gonna help me out and ( um ) we'll just go from there that's how i would break it to them
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so but you have a plan then
client.fn	you know
-	-
client.o+7	yeah all right on this day this is what i'm doing and this is what we're gonna do all right everybody ready break [laugh] ( you know ) [laugh]
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.rec	get everyone on board help me hold myself accountable
client.fn	yeah you know
-	-
client.o+7	right yup that's what i would do
-	-
counselor.rec	and if they don't support you
-	-
client.o+7	yeah and then if they don't support me then i would just have to figure out a ( s* s* ) to i would figure out ( uh ) another way or time to do the same thing but ( that's that ) that would be the way i'd have to do it is cold turkey ( you know )
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	so that's what it would look like for you
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o+7	and ( um ) right now inside i'm just every day i'm like okay is today gonna be the day i ask myself that every day ( today ) is today gonna be the day and i feel it winding down i feel it getting to that point ( you know ) i really do
counselor.res	you like you
-	-
counselor.res	feel like you're getting closer and closer to getting ready
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( that ) that's all the that's another part of why i decided to talk to naomi yesterday
client.o+7	( you know ) because i was like oh maybe i will ( you know ) and i'm glad i did ( you know ) i'm glad i did i thought about some things i probably wouldn't have thought about said some things too
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.o+7	so ( you know you know and ha* ) and having done all this it gives me more to think about tonight and raising more important questions i may have to ask hmm
-	-
counselor.af	well i'm really glad we had the chance to talk
counselor.rec	and it sounds like you have a solid idea but what's ( um ) quitting would look like for you ( you know ) in terms of deciding when you're ready and when you're ready telling all of your people [laugh] look this is what's happening i'm making these changes ( um ) and then you're just at a point now where you're ( you know ) getting closer and closer ( to ) to that day
client.fn	mm
client.fn	right
-	-
client.o+7	( suc* ) success [laugh] that's what i call it success
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+7	yeah and nothing it's been nothing but the opposite
-	-
counselor.quc	[laugh] yeah so ( um ) do you have a timeline for ( um ) when you'd like to see yourself
-	-
client.o-7	no not a timeline
-	-
counselor.res	( it's ) it's just still taking it day by day
client.o+7	i mean if you call as
-	-
client.o+7	soon as possible a timeline and i mean really as soon as possible
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+7	i'm telling you ( if there ) if i can do if there was something that i ( c* ) can do to just make it happen right now oh i'd be on it right now
client.fn	a lot of people can't say that because if somebody actually did have something they pull it out and go huh well wait let me think about it [laugh] ( you know )
-	-
counselor.res	yeah so you're not there yet today but you could be there any day now
client.o+7	me heck no
-	-

client.fn	so i said oh i'm intended to [du] went back to the other
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	that's great
counselor.gi	okay so one of the things that you did today was ( um uh ) a screening tool called the dast drug_abuse_screening_tool
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	and it measures the risk of harm ( uh ) that a person might experience due to their substance use
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	and ( um ) it's on a scale of zero to ten zero being no ( uh ) risk of harm ten being extreme ( s* ) or severe risk of harm
counselor.quc	where do you think you fell on that zero to ten scale
-	-
client.o+4	probably eight
-	-
counselor.gi	okay you actually ( um ) scored a six
client.fn	mm okay
counselor.gi	( um ) but you know what it's still within that same range
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	[du]
counselor.gi	so whether it was six or eight you'd still be in that top category
client.fn	okay
client.fn	okay
counselor.quo	so ( um ) tell me why you said eight
counselor.quo	what's going on that makes you feel like you're at severe risk
client.fn	[du]

counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.res	you're tired of drug use
client.o+4	oh

client.r+4	( you know ) i'm ( fifty ) fifty_six diabetes high blood pressure so forth like that gout
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+4	and it's just it's running and ( uh ) drugs i know ( it's not uh ) it's ( not ) not really helpful
-	-
counselor.res	mm-hmm to either one of those conditions or any ( uh ) or
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o+4	i don't think it'd be good for anyone [du] yes
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	okay have you
counselor.gi	( um y* i'm ) i'm not i'm gonna misquote you
counselor.quc	but you said something to the effect of ( um uh too much has ) too much has gone on
counselor.quc	is that what you said
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.r+4	( you know ) as far as my health
counselor.fa	oh okay
client.r+4	that's what i mean ( you know ) my health ( is ge* is not as ge* ) is not as good as when i was young
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.o+4	and even when you're young you don't really need to do drugs either too
-	-
counselor.res	yeah so ( you're really ) you're really aware of the ( um ) potential for harm to your health by using substances and
client.o+4	oh yeah
client.o+4	[laugh] every time
-	-
client.o+4	i go see somebody i know [du]
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	okay and you're really clear that you wanna stop
counselor.quc	or did you wanna just hopefully cut back
client.nc	[laugh]
counselor.quo	or what's your goal
client.r+d4	no i wanna just
-	-
client.r+d4	stop
-	-
counselor.res	you wanna stop
-	-
client.r+4	because i'd like to get off all medications period
client.r-4	but i know it's gonna be hard
client.fn	but yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	okay what do you think is gonna be most helpful to you ( um ) achieving that goal
-	-
client.fn	talking with you
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	okay that is ( you know ) as far as social worker
client.fn	i mean ( you know ) you do ( uh you know ) when you ( like ) i've been to maybe about three ( uh ) inpatient_outpatient programs
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	and i know ( you know ) for ( you know ) that sixty to ninety days okay yeah everything's good and dandy because you're talking to somebody
-	-
client.r-4	but then when you have when you're out of it for ( maybe ) i'd say maybe another thirty to sixty days things get to tripping up in your mind and so forth
client.r+n4	i just need a little help you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	okay so do you think you need to go back to a formal treatment program
client.fn	no
-	-
client.fn	( i ) i they're good they're good yeah
client.o+4	but i need a little ( mu* ) somewhat like medications you know what i'm saying that's what i need i think
-	-
counselor.quo	what kind of medication
-	-
client.fn	( i ) i talked to somebody there's this ( uh ) the seattle_health_department located down on fourth ave
client.fn	and i ran into a guy that i did know [cough] and ( uh ) he was telling me about ( uh ) a program called suboxone
-	-
counselor.fa	oh yeah
-	-
client.fn	( and ) and i called ( uh ) this place on massachusetts
client.fn	and i would have to go through so many changes to get on suboxone i kinda dropped it ( you know )
counselor.su	it's hard
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.gi	it's
-	-
counselor.gi	it's yeah yeah suboxone programs are ( um ) far and few between
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	and ( um ) there's a lot of criteria to get into a suboxone program
client.fn	okay
counselor.res	( um ) but that's what you're mostly interested in
-	-
client.o+4	mm yeah basically getting off the drugs yes yeah yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	so not ( like ) methadone maintenance you don't want that
-	-
client.fn	no ( you know ) methadone maintenance ( it's ) it bothers my ( uh ) i have emphysema too actually i didn't say that but i have emphysema
client.fn	and see ( uh ) when i used to be on i've been on methadone maybe two to three times within the thirty year period of my drug use
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and now that my breathing's bad ( i ) i find myself waking up at night catching my breath more because of the methadone
-	-
client.fn	and when i used to go to the programs i seen a lot of people using ( uh ) oxygen
client.fn	and ( i ) i don't and with my ( m* ) what i see i just don't think that ( uh ) the methadone's good ( uh ) to mix with ( uh you know ) it that ( uh ) that's all with my bad breathing
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quc	okay have you ever talked to a doctor about that
counselor.gi	because ( e* ) ( the ) the first thing that's ( um ) i'm curious about when you tell me you see a lot of people on ( um ) oxygen i just wonder if ( you know ) they were probably smoking for a lot of years in addition to using and it just might be a coincidence ( that ) that
client.fn	no
client.fn	oxygen
client.fn	yeah yeah yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	maybe it's a coincidence but ( you know ) i know i know the health doesn't get any better as long as they're on that methadone either though
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) because i know if anything it's a short ( i* i* uh ) the longest i've ever been on methadone ( uh ) programs is about two months yeah two months
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	and i certainly don't wanna sound like i'm trying to talk you into that because i'm not here to talk you into anything
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	( i just ) i just kinda wanna explore that a little bit more
client.fn	okay
counselor.res	okay you want suboxone
client.fn	but i will do methadone if they keep it down
client.fn	it seems like excuse me i ( uh ) don't mean to come at you like that ( if they ) [laugh] ( it it ) it just seems like they wanna put you on a higher dose
counselor.gi	no
counselor.gi	that's okay
client.fn	and i don't like ( i don't ) i don't need a high dose ( you know ) i don't
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) they wanna put you at sixty ( uh t* you know ) and so forth like that
client.fn	i don't need that much
client.fn	( you know ) and i know that mainly ( you know my ) my drug use ( it ) it's just after ( it's just it's just ) it's a mind thing it's a mind thing for me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+n4	see so ( i just ) i just need a little help that's all ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	okay okay so suboxone or methadone if they're willing to put you on a lower dose than sixty
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	oh yes sure
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	and then would your goal be to taper
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah for sure eventually
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	because i don't wanna be on any one of the programs say after a year
client.fn	because i've seen well i know people that's been on it fifteen twenty years
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) and they're always asking me why aint i on them yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.su	i hear you
counselor.rec	okay so ( that's really ) that i can you're saying that with a lot of strength so i can tell that that's what you really want you really wanna be off medication
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	okay well i'll tell you what i'll do i will
counselor.gi	( um ) i don't know ( uh ) very much about suboxone i gotta be honest
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	but i'm happy to look ( and ) and see what i can learn today
counselor.gi	and then ( uh ) we can go down that road and if it looks like it's feasible ( um ) we can get you started
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	the other thing is ( you know um ) this is not something that is probably gonna ( um ) be immediately put in place today
client.fn	right i know
-	-
client.fn	that i do
counselor.gi	so
-	-
counselor.gi	so we have a c_d counselor here in_clinic that ( um ) i can set you up to follow up with ( if ) if you think that might be helpful
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	okay
counselor.quc	do you wanna do that
-	-
client.o+4	okay i can do that
-	-
counselor.ec	okay it's up to you
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	( if if ) if that's gonna be helpful
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	okay let's see
-	-
client.fn	and when you say c_d ( uh ) what's
-	-
counselor.gi	chemical dependency
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	so ( she ju* ) she would be a counselor who would offer support ( uh ) follow up on what we start today
client.fn	okay
client.fn	okay
client.fn	okay
counselor.quc	okay
client.o+4	that would be fine
-	-
client.o+4	that would be fine
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) okay i think i just have to
counselor.gi	let me also look into my trails_to_treatment
counselor.gi	i don't know if it has anything on suboxone it's a little bit outdated
-	-
counselor.quc	( um ) what's your insurance

counselor.quc	okay so you must receive ( um ) do you receive ( uh ) medicare and then sometimes receive medicaid
client.fn	yes
counselor.quc	and ( uh ) do you know what you've spendown it
counselor.gi	it looks like you're on [du]

counselor.gi	yeah
client.fn	oh six_hundred or something like that i think
-	-
counselor.quc	so your spend on six_hundred

-	-
counselor.quc	accrue six_hundred in medical bills you get on medicaid
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	oh and i do get ( i'm ) i'm there believe it

counselor.gi	suboxone
counselor.gi	yup
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	but it's not telling me about suboxone or buprenorphine

client.fn	i'd go over there and basically ( and ) help this one lady who used to be a man now she switched to a lady
client.fn	i've been trying to get her to tell me all of her life i've known her for two years now
client.fn	i met her over there at magnolia she'd moved over to that [du] on fremont

counselor.fa	mm-hmm

-	-
client.fn	right now if she passed away tomorrow and they come in with the coroners whoever come in to take her body away and get it cremated
client.fn	( you know ) they could look at her and stuff i tell her this ( i can m* ) i take care of you
client.fn	i've been living her for three years since i quit long-haul trucking
client.fn	and who's gonna be responsible
client.fn	they could arrest me just like they did that one guy that
client.fn	( i ) i keep asking my mom do you got any bed sores on there
client.fn	i'll clean her room downstairs and junk i don't have any bed sores and she doesn't even realize that ( uh ) i can be ( uh )
client.fn	so what do i do in the meantime
-	-
client.fn	( when i want be ) because she's raised me since i was ten
client.fn	at eight-years-old my dad ( was uh ) beat the hell out of us that's all i can remember my first ten years i've blacked out
client.fn	born in frankfurt_germany my dad was a c_four_seven pilot flied in berlin he left came back when he went to fairchild_air_force_base in spokane
client.fn	and then he was killed in fifty_eight in mid-air collision between two b_fifty_twos
client.fn	he was a pilot of one major [du] the other one
-	-
client.fn	my mom's never remarried so she can go to v_a she can go any place
client.fn	she doesn't want to leave that apartment she wants to die right in there
counselor.su	wow
client.fn	she'd been in there since seventy_two
-	-
client.fn	so my sister's down in portland the heroin addict that she is
client.fn	telling me that she's on methadone and everything
client.fn	and i'm sitting there she's been up here once in ( let's see ) three years
client.fn	and she's two and a half hours away
client.fn	and i just blew up ( you know i get ) i get irate when i talk to my sister ( you know um ) i just get irate
client.fn	so i have to sit down there and say ( you know ) well if you don't do anything larry i'm coming up and i'll pick her up and take her to ballard and swedish
client.fn	i say well come up and do it then
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	she won't
-	-
client.r-7	so that's why i usually take this to relax
client.fn	( keep the tripl* ) she bought this triplex on magnolia_hill in seventy_two she bought and sold it in 2007 she hated that part
client.fn	( but you know but ) my sister came up here and needed some money and i talked her into that and junk
client.fn	and ( uh ) she bought it with her life at stake to stay there until the day she dies you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	the owner ( matt uh ) matt_flint and dennis_flynn and brother live down below the flynn brothers
client.fn	but ( he uh you know ) he we sold it into parts my sister took all her money and probably blew it up in her arm
client.fn	( i don't know ) check for ten and ten_and_twenty or whatever
client.fn	i just took like twelve_hundred a month until the day i die but he switched this one thing
client.fn	i'm telling you shit about why i do stuff
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	he ( uh ) [nvv] we're going to take him to court with my lawyer down here in the bank_of_america building
client.fn	he says hey well let's take him to court because it didn't go for months you know
client.fn	everything's going down the drain financially places and everything
client.fn	so i went from twelve_hundred down to five_hundred a month that he pays me now [laugh] monthly until the day i die
client.fn	but he wrote it and said it was ( until it ) until the day my mom dies which was wrong on the thing he hasn't changed it yet
client.fn	so that's another thing that ( uh )
-	-
counselor.rec	you've got some responsibilities and stress and
-	-
client.fn	and stress and junk and stuff
client.fn	and the only thing i do is stay there i take care of my mom
client.fn	the doctor's here in harbor_view
client.fn	my fingers were absolutely frozen ( tu* ) tuesday morning coming down here ( on a ) on the thirty_three and stuff and i got out for a minute or two to switch from the thirty-three to the three or the four
client.fn	and doctors say ( you know ) carolyn_orenson my main doctor and tell it from india he says you should move to phoenix you got to walk everyday
client.fn	( with ) now i got two stints in my arteries put in at arizona_harness ninety_six
client.fn	i got four in my heart my circulation is shot
client.c+6	and i'm going to get these little cigarettes with the vapors [du] to start smoking them so i can quit smoking a cigarettes
client.r+6	because that's killing me
client.fn	and getting out and walking every day
client.fn	and ( um ) the main thing
counselor.rec	you're concerned about your health it sounds like
client.fn	for my health oh and i'm supposed to be in phoenix every summer every winter i mean
counselor.fa	oh yeah
client.fn	just so i can walk and be in the warmer climate
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	but then who's gonna take care of my mom
client.fn	my sister that's not your responsibility you're sixty_two years old go get a life
-	-
client.fn	i've been married twice no kids no children at all
client.fn	you know i treated ( them ) those two wives nice people i just treated them like hell because i wasn't
client.fn	i guess i treated them like my dad treated my mom ( you know ) beat up and everything
-	-
client.fn	then he took me hunting once
client.fn	absolutely nothing about it
client.fn	all i remember is going out by liberty_lake around the spokane area and ( um ) hunting and ( um ) i must've had a rifle in my hand
client.fn	my mom and i talked about this about a month ago
client.fn	i said you know my god i wish i could go get a ( th* ) thing and figure out ( uh ) whatever happened to me that day going out hunting
client.fn	( you know ) i must've had a rifle i'd love to know what my dad called me we must've had a deer [du] or something
client.fn	chicken shit little sissy or something
client.fn	i can't shoot a thing in my life i never could after that the only time i ever went
counselor.fa	hmm
-	-
client.fn	so then when my dad got killed he was ( in ) at fairchild moving back into our house on twenty_four ( and uh ) and pray
client.fn	( and uh yeah because ) and then my mom stayed until sixty_six 'til i graduated from louis_and_clark
client.fn	( but uh you know ) she says oh don't ever blame your dad for that
client.fn	because she is a martini drinker all of her life so she probably drank martinis back then too
client.fn	but i don't condone any guy hitting a woman in my life that's all i remember
client.fn	so who's gonna take care of my mom
-	-
counselor.af	yeah good question
-	-
client.fn	i mean put her in a
client.fn	she's not gonna go into a she'll find something around the apartment
client.fn	if she ever knew anybody was going to take her out of that apartment take her to a nursing home she wouldn't live a day
counselor.rec	she's strong willed
client.fn	i know it in a heartbeat [laugh]
-	-
counselor.res	yeah so it sounds like ( you're ) you're talking about using about oxycontin
counselor.res	and you use oxycontin really as a kind of a way to get going in the morning
-	-
client.o-4	that's all i do yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-4	it gives me a good high
-	-
counselor.quo	( what do you ) what do you feel about that
counselor.quo	( how to ) what do you feel about having to do that
-	-
client.fn	well i haven't done it in two days
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	basically because of
counselor.quo	how's that goin
client.fn	no i got myself up today at ( uh you know to ) to go over and see her this morning
client.fn	( she was ) she's out and ( you know ) she gets her other sixty minutes
client.fn	i go over there first this morning i told her i didn't take one this morning
client.fn	i didn't take one yesterday because i was supposed to come down yesterday
client.fn	i was over there talking to her so much
client.fn	( uh ) and i wanted to ( get so* ) just to get to talk to somebody
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	you know ( and uh ) i don't feel bad now ( you know )
client.r-4	it's ( uh it's ) getting up and getting my clothes on [laugh] and ( uh )
counselor.rec	it's really just the start of the day it sounds like
client.r-4	just the start of the day well
counselor.res	once you're up it's fine
-	-
client.fn	( sh* he* ) this guy gave me seven of them seven thirties
client.fn	i've got four that i've had four sitting there for about ( like ) since monday
client.fn	( uh ) tuesday and no wednesday and thursday i didn't take one i did take one
client.fn	( um ) i cut them in half and just take fifteen
client.fn	and maybe now when you talk about it ( i* ) i'm thinking how i got up today and i'm feeling like this
client.fn	well i went to her place and ( had a ) had a four a cranberry and lemonade one
client.fn	( you know their ) the big twenty_four ounce that twelve ounce drink down here
client.fn	and watched [du] father and leave_it_to_beaver
client.fn	and came down here at one o'clock [laugh]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	that's [laugh] my day in the life
client.r-1	so ( uh ) i feel pretty good but it's probably the alcohol in it that got me up
client.fn	i don't know i really can't tell i really can't tell
client.r-4	but when i have the oxycontin in me i feel like i'm on a like taking crisscross back
-	-
client.fn	i told her ( you know ) chelsea back in sixty_nine through maybe seventy_two
client.fn	a couple years when they were out there on the street and shit
client.r-4	and ( um ) it gives you that feeling that you can do something
client.o+4	i know it's bad
client.r+4	and especially it makes me smoke more number one i know that for a heartbeat
client.o-4	and sometimes i think ( i have a uh ) i have an attitude in myself that ( doesn't ) i don't care i don't care about taking it and feeling better like that and smoking cigarettes
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	because ( uh ) what the hell do i do every day except go over to see joyce and watch a few things on tv come home take care of my mom and there ( and uh )
counselor.res	well you
client.fn	it's a tough one i don't know sometimes i really do
-	-
counselor.res	( you so ) you you know that it's bad you said that you know that it's bad
counselor.quo	what do you mean by that
-	-
client.r+4	well i know it's bad because number one it's illegal for me
counselor.fa	uh huh
client.r+4	number two ( it uh ) it makes me smoke cigarettes more
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+6	and here i'm getting ready to call this number and ( uh ) get a hold of ( th* that ) the place that
client.fn	( uh ) i can't even remember what the hell it is
client.r+n6	but i got to call there this week
client.fn	i don't even know ( uh ) i know i have it written down here someplace [du]
client.fn	[nvv] where was that thing
client.fn	well someplace in here i've got written down to call this number about ( um ) smoking cigarettes that have ( vapor ) water vapor
counselor.gi	oh yeah i've seen that
client.fn	yeah and i have it written down in here someplace
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) i was sitting down and watching this thing
client.o+4	so ( you know ) if i'm gonna get these cigarettes i sure as hell don't want to take
client.r+4	( uh ) because the main thing that ( um ) when something doesn't wake me up when ( i ) i had that oxycontin is they make me smoke more cigarettes again
client.r-1	but then i also go over there and ( and uh ) drink alcohol with a thirty milligram of that and so that enhances it in a heartbeat you know [sound]
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so you've gotten into the routine of smoking cigarettes when you take oxycontin ( um )
-	-
client.fn	oh i've been smoking cigarettes since i was twenty_one years old
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	that's when i started to
-	-
counselor.rec	but you know ( you're ) you're concerned enough about your health it sounds like you do have
counselor.rec	i mean you talked about an attitude of not caring but it sounds like you do care somewhat about your health if you're taking these steps to
client.fn	well i just
-	-
client.fn	well yeah i'm so mixed
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+7	you know i don't want let's put it this way number one in my mind is i don't want to die
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	number two is the only way oh i'm chicken shit i couldn't go jump off a bridge and i joke with joyce now and then she says and i said that's why i go over there sometimes
client.fn	because i said ( you know ) i'll take the money out of my ( acc* ) fifteen_hundred i've gotten enough from her because i have her whole direct ( ex* ) service card direct express card i can go down to [du] and pay her rent
client.fn	i make sure her refrigerator is absolutely packed and loaded
client.fn	i do the thing you're supposed to do the rest of it ( you know )
-	-
client.fn	(You know ) like just last week and a half until the sixteenth come
client.fn	but then she says ( i ) you know i'm going to be so happy when i get these sixty she just got sixty methadones on september the sixteenth and just absolutely blew them the wrong way
client.fn	( um ) but when i turn my back she's only supposed to have two a day she'd take four ( you know ) twenty milligrams instead of ten
client.fn	( and uh ) to put her tolerance up
client.fn	her tolerance i saw her put a needle in four times in her leg the other day
client.fn	and i said that's bullshit ( so um ) i'm trying to help her not do the wrong thing
-	-
client.fn	( But i ) and then i joke to much [du]
client.r+4	but then when i really seriously think about it smoking cigarettes and this is really hypocritical [err] because when i'm doing it and taking the oxycontin and then sometimes i get this really bad chest pain ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i haven't taken a vicodin yet they're right in there in my black bag
client.fn	( i'm not a ) i mean a nitroglycerin [err] or vicodin i haven't had any
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	Now if anybody in the apartment place had any vicodin or percocet they're just like an oxycontin to me
client.fn	if i take a pain pill i can take a half of one most people take two or three to get high
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-4	my tolerance is so low on pain pills and stuff i can take a five five_hundred vicodin and cut it in half and take half a one and it makes my body feel good
client.fn	( you know ) most people ( couldn't even they'll ) drop ( fiv* ) four or five of those things ( so uh ) things like that yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so you feel sort of two ways about it you know it's unhealthy there's a number of things that are unhealthy but at the same time you're getting something out of it ( you're ) that you like you're getting a high you're getting
client.fn	right
client.fn	exactly
counselor.quo	so ( what are ) what are you gonna do about that
counselor.quo	what do you think you can do
-	-
client.fn	you don't want to know the answer because ( i don't wa* ) i'm not saying it out of my mouth
client.fn	i gotta go put this thing over here and get my
-	-
counselor.quo	what do you mean by that
client.nc	[grunt]
counselor.quc	are you talking about ( like ) hurting yourself or
-	-
client.o+7	oh no i'm just i'll keep doing it and stuff and junk
client.fn	( and me ) i've been off of these things ( for ) because they ran out and the doctor i gotta go put these in
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.ec	well i'm just curious about what you want to do
counselor.gi	i mean i'm not telling you what to do i'm just
client.fn	these were making me feel pretty good
client.fn	what the heck
-	-
counselor.quc	that's penicillin
-	-
client.fn	no ( citrap* ) citroplan [err] whatever they are they're supposed to be an antidepressant
counselor.gi	right here yeah
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	but ( uh ) i've been off of them now for about a week
client.fn	and ( um ) oh sure i ( have ) have mixed feelings on lots of things
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	but like i said no i don't want to go hurting myself
client.fn	i don't want to ( that's the ) and here's the big thing ( i don't want to ) i don't want to sit around i don't want to watch more sports like the husky_a_s_u game go make a three_hundred and thirty dollar bet
client.fn	and i won three_hundred tonight you gotta get down and been to a few places
client.fn	i feel good like that
client.fn	other times when i go home i'm around my mom and around this joyce then there's the mixed feeling
client.fn	why in the hell am i here in the first place
client.fn	and if i left and if i just picked up because i can afford it and head to phoenix right now
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	why don't i just pick up my bag and jump on an airplane and go down there ( because )
client.fn	buy a car when i get down there or something
-	-
counselor.rec	well you have ( resp* ) you feel responsible here
-	-
client.fn	well hell yeah my conscience wouldn't let me live down there for a frickin ( uh )
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i wouldn't be able to stay down in phoenix for ( uh ) or vegas or ( any* ) [laugh]
client.fn	i like the hot places down there
client.fn	but i like gambling and i do pretty good at it
client.fn	( um ) i couldn't stay there for three or four days that would be it
client.fn	i'd have to be back up here or ( i'd do something ) i'd just flip i'd flip somehow and they know i would
client.fn	[nvv] i wouldn't leave in the first place who's gonna take care of my mother my sister sure as hell isn't
counselor.nc	[nvv]
-	-
counselor.quc	so tell me are there things ( that you might ) that you're thinking that you might want to change
counselor.quo	or what are some things that you might want to change about your drug use right now
-	-
client.r+d6	[grunts] well the only way i don't want to ( i'd want to ) i'd want to get on the cigarettes so i can't smoke cigarettes anymore number one and it comes before anything
client.o+4	and if i get off the drugs ( um ) i probably will quit ( smo* you know ) cigarette smoking that's the number one thing like that
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	i don't know how i would ever feel like that ( um )
-	-
counselor.quo	feel like what
counselor.quc	like quitting oxy
-	-
client.fn	just staying at home and absolutely going crazy absolutely going nuts
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know i mean i've had ) [sound] i have weird dreams weird dreams and weird thoughts sometimes about that triplex and junk
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	and politicians and ( uh ) everything ( you know )
client.fn	it's things that are in my mind that ( not ) you know [grunt] no well you don't know ( so ) [laugh]
client.o-7	( um you know quitting ) quitting all this stuff first it probably right now ( i don't' know ) it'd probably make me go nuts with my mom still alive
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	and then the worst thing in your life is to wish that your mother was passed away
-	-
counselor.rec	so it doesn't sound like you have any plans necessarily to stop
-	-
client.o-7	i don't no
counselor.res	no
counselor.fa	okay
client.o-7	i'd say a hundred percent i have no plans right now
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	i haven't even made ( i ) like that number ( you know )
-	-
counselor.quc	and not because necessarily you don't want to but because you don't think you could
-	-
client.r-a7	i don't think i could
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r+d7	oh i want to
-	-
counselor.res	you do want to
client.fn	i
-	-
client.r-a7	yeah i just i just don't think i could
counselor.res	but you don't think you could
-	-
counselor.quo	what would it take for you ( to ) to change your mind
-	-
client.fn	i haven't the faintest idea
-	-
counselor.res	no
-	-
client.fn	no
counselor.rec	less stress
-	-
client.r+n7	it's something that's gotta be changed within a few months i know that because
client.fn	( uh ) and i think ( i ) it was gonna be one on november fourth i'm coming in for my second colonoscopy
client.fn	and i know like last night i thought i was having appendicitis it was down in here
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	i had the hardest time even taking a ( uh you know ) getting ( st* ) and taking a dump
client.fn	but i tell you one thing i should have had it last month i was called for a thing called too late had one day to do it and couldn't even drink the stuff to ( uh ) get me all cleaned out
client.fn	and so i called in at three_thirty in the morning and told them i couldn't make it that morning
client.fn	because ( i had ) i drank a cup of that junk ( and uh )
client.fn	but the last night it was just the worst pain i've ever had in here
client.fn	and like the doctor broussard said oh she [du] she goes well a seven or eight is a lot of polyps to cut out of a colon the first time
client.fn	then they cut eighteen out of me
counselor.fa	hm
client.fn	and ( uh ) [laugh] you hear her growing out and ( it feels like uh ) it feels like the whole thing is it i probably got thirty of them in there who knows
client.fn	but at least their going in november the fourth i don't have [du] that
-	-
counselor.quc	that's an important date
counselor.quc	( is that ) is that do you think they may change something
-	-
client.fn	i don't know i haven't the faintest
counselor.res	no
client.fn	but ( wh* ) what ( you know ) it depends on what they say in that thing
-	-
counselor.res	so ( ha* ) medical issues sounds like it's a could be a factor
client.fn	they say something's
-	-
client.o+7	good from it and comes out good from it i'll probably ( uh ) do what you said
client.r-d7	i don't have right now is a reason or a want to quit
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+7	if something comes out good on november the fourth on all of it ( everything's ) nothing's malignant and they're all benign then i'd probably i might just change my mind
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+7	i mean i might change to absolutely call if ( uh ) do everything that's supposed to be right that's the only thing that i can think of
client.fn	in the meantime there's nothing i can do about my mom nothing at all [laughs] you know so ( uh )
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	does she have
counselor.quc	( um ) what kind of insurance does she have
-	-
client.fn	she's got v_a
client.fn	she's got her little v_a card and her medicare card
counselor.res	v_a
-	-
counselor.quc	does the v_a offer any kind of in home care
-	-

counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm okay
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	do you see any down sides of it stimulating your appetite
-	-
client.o-2	no ( uh ) no
-	-
counselor.rec	[du] you talked about the good thing is that it stimulates your appetite but the bad thing is that sometimes you overeat
-	-
client.r+2	yeah sometimes i'll go overboard on the eating because ( you know my ) my stomach is not what it used to be
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	and actually i'm still in the healing process
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	even though it's been a little over a year since i got out of the hospital not since the operation

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+1	all the surgeries are basically from drinking
counselor.fa	yeah oh
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	and most of that is when i learned my lesson too late

client.fn	but i learned it [du] before actually not too late because i'm not dead
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i'm old and i'm slow but i ain't cold that's for sure

client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	right
client.fn	well tell me
client.fn	has anyone ever actually told you ( that um that uh well ) that marijuana ( cannot ) is not addictive
client.fn	[du] has anyone ever told you that you can't ( get hooked ) get hooked on marijuana
counselor.gi	( w* ) people ( s* ) believe that yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	some people believe you can
-	-
client.r+1	right ( uh ) because ( you know ) you always hear these things about drugs and i think drinking will get you deader than any drug
counselor.res	more trouble than
client.fn	but i can't say one drug is better than another drug because a drug is a drug is a drug
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	sure
client.fn	and ( uh ) for a while i went to a_a ( and ) and i went to c_a then i went to n_a
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	no one asked me to go no one told me to go i went on my own yeah
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	and so ( um ) i learned a lot in there ( uh ) just going in and sitting down and getting the books
client.o+1	and but i did it because ( uh ) dang ( you know ) you can't drink no more
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so let me see what these folks here are saying ( you know a* ) and kinda ( en* ) encourage me
counselor.fa	sure
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so i decided to do it by myself i did it had a little boost from a_a after i got out
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	but it was just a different life then
client.fn	and i didn't think i would smoke marijuana again
counselor.fa	hmm
client.r-2	but all of a sudden i had that craving
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so you talked about ( the ) the one you talked about how it helps your appetite and gets you to eat more so you ( can ) don't lose weight but you also talked about it that it sometimes causes you ( to kinda ) to binge eat ( which ) and eat more than ( you ) your body can process
client.fn	right
client.fn	right
counselor.quc	( um ) any concerns about how you wanna deal with that
counselor.quc	or do you want ( to ) to try to moderate that
client.fn	well a*
client.r-d2	at this point in my life i don't want to
client.c-2	because i'm not going to
counselor.fa	mm
client.r-2	( you know ) but i don't see where it's detrimental to me
counselor.gi	i'm talking about ( the ) by the using that you overeat then
client.fn	what
-	-
client.o-2	oh oh oh now see that i don't think i'm gonna be able to have no control over it
client.o-2	because ( i mean ) when ( it's time ) it's time to eat well then and the repercussions [err] ( recom* ) however you say it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+2	i'm gonna end up spitting it out the next day or [du] at night before i go bed i'm gonna end up sick as a dog but it's what i put in is coming right back out
counselor.fa	right
client.r+2	and sometimes not chewed up and that's the hardest part and it comes up through the esophagus
counselor.fa	sure sure
-	-
counselor.quc	so ( do you see that by ) do you think that because you've smoked the marijuana to help increase your appetite that it increased it too much
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	( and that's w* ) and so is there a problem there for you for that
-	-
client.r+2	( uh ) well yeah there is a problem ( you know ) and the down side of it is that it ( you know ) is kinda ( like ) detrimental to my health
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	( you know ) i mean by ( you know ) the doctor already told me what i done he said if you make it off this table because there's so many major things that they had to do
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and even the coroner was ( in the ) in the operating room
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	or ( he he ) he came in the end after everything was over after that after i could talk and laugh and stuff

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i like looked at him and i was like i thought i wouldn't be able to meet you until i'm dead and still i thought i'd ( uh you know )
-	-
client.fn	he said no i just wanted to let you know i was in the operation with them
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	he said and i was there to make sure that they put certain parts back in the right way and then we had to move your stomach up and had to do this
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and he said of course they told me it was ( uh ) four doctors doing four different things for surgery
counselor.fa	hmm
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	and ( they ) he said well ( i ) i told them that you'd be ( you'd be uh um ) a miracle
counselor.fa	hmm

counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	and it's a good thing i walked away because usually ( i'm i ) i go [laugh] i get really ( invol* ) involved with it ( you know ) so

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	you feel like there are more people out there using now
-	-
client.fn	well no i'm just saying ( you know ) being acquainted with other people ( that ) that's doing the same thing ( you know ) and ( uh th* uh ) they always need help finding it and this and that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+7	and ( you know ) can be pretty hectic cause i don't like dealing with other people [laugh]
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah it sounds like it's a pretty serious lifestyle kinda commitment huh
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+7	mm-hmm and there's never nothing safe about it because usually it results ( you know uh ) women wanna trade the drug for sex ( you know ) now so
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so you've given me ( some ) some motivations for wanting ( to ) to change something
-	-
client.o+7	yeah i do
counselor.fa	yeah
client.ts+6	i mean ( you know ) i come here because ( you know ) i was in a car accident and i needed ( t* ) to see a primary doctor and go into some other things ( you know ) like the smoking cessation thing
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( uh ) i already do the ( um um ) seeing ( a ) a nutritionist here ( for that uh ) for losing weight for and ( you know ) other programs to help me motivate myself ( you know )
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	but ( uh ) like i say ( uh ) they only had one primary doctor and she hasn't yet brought up anything and i dunno if she is prepared and ready for anything
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	so i'm just ( like on a ) on a waitlist
-	-
counselor.rec	all right ( you're ) so you're involved ( with with um ) with treatment and you've
-	-
client.fn	well ( i ) i go to meetings ( you know ) and i've been to a twenty_eight day program ( last like last ) earlier last month
client.r+7	and that's because it'd gotten really really hairy
client.r+7	( you know ) and i didn't ( i i you know uh ) i thought that if i wind up dying out there because i was ( like r* ) really feeling ( uh um ) uneasy real dirty
client.fn	( uh ) [du] i went to it was giving out some clothing ( you know ) to wear look at this ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	yeah it's nice
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+7	mm-hmm so yeah ( um ) i'm always ( you know ) getting around some ( pr* ) pretty much i'm clean
client.fn	but ( it's ) it's hard to stick around because a lot of people busy so i gotta find something else to do
client.ts+7	( you know ) so ( i ) i decided this morning to go to a meeting this morning it was really nice
-	-
counselor.rec	so ( you're going to n_a ) you're going to n_a meetings
-	-
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i go ( som* ) whenever i can find one
-	-
counselor.fa	right right
-	-
client.o+7	( you know ) and ( um ) i'm looking to get a sponsor or something ( you know ) somebody ( you know ) to go with me through the steps and stuff
counselor.fa	right
counselor.af	great
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i'm learning pretty much about it ( you know ) but i'm always off and on i'm ( s* ) not ( s* ) it's so sporadic for me it's just whatever i can do
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	you know
counselor.res	so ( you've ) you've got ( a ) a primary doctor and you've been to
-	-
client.fn	( s* ) i don't i've been trying to get one
counselor.res	oh you don't okay
counselor.gi	i see
client.fn	and so it's really getting me really messed up
client.fn	( you know ) i have a doctor whose dana but this guy here he's a guy that refers you to ( um uh other ) other doctors that can be your primary doctor i mean somebody you can see that's for a lifetime
counselor.fa	sure
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah it can be difficult ( t* ) to get in here
counselor.af	but it sounds like you're pretty motivated
counselor.af	( you know ) you've been to some smoking cessation classes you participate ( in in ) in n_a
client.o+7	i'm doing
client.o+7	the best i can
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.res	( um ) and you also mentioned some other you do other things to help motivate you
counselor.quc	can you tell me a little bit more about what some of those things are
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( um ) they're just ( they had um uh you know ) they just had an ( easter ) easter day ( you know um uh ) easter sunday easter where it was supposed to be ( like ) an easter monday easter was monday right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	i think easter's usually sunday
client.fn	easter day
-	-
client.fn	it's ( well ) well easter sunday
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and they ( uh ) invited me out to the park over here in green_lake
counselor.quc	who did who did
client.fn	( um ) they had a barbecue they had meetings well it was ( like ) scattered
client.fn	so once if you're down there if you wasn't comfortable then you can go to another one
client.fn	because you might sometimes find people ( you ) you don't get really comfortable with
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so you can move and go do some other things ( you know )
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	it worked out really nice
client.fn	( you know ) but it was cold so i didn't have a really heavy strong jacket for that but i stayed there long as i could
-	-
counselor.rec	right so it's helpful for you to be around people who are ( you know ) going through something similar as you and kinda make connections
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o+7	yeah i'm trying to make this thing work
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-7	but i still get kinda ( like ) offbeat with my decisions
-	-
counselor.quo	( tell me ) tell me more about that
counselor.quo	what does that mean
counselor.rec	it sounds like you have some ( uh ) ( you know ) you're motivated but at the same time there's some problems
client.fn	well
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	can you describe that
client.fn	when i think eh
-	-
client.r-7	if i ( st* ) start thinking about family matters or where i'm gonna live at ( um ) how i'm gonna get a job and all that stuff ( you know ) i try to put it together and ( it like ) i get pretty discouraged sometime if it's not working [laugh]
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	so ( you ) just your situation you're in is discouraging
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	and ( uh ) you feel like that is ( a um ) a trigger for use
-	-
client.r-7	mm yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-7	because ( you know ) i might get around someone and say 'hey man come with me' and ( you know you know ) most people's drug use usually don't specifically talk they don't specifically talk about what you gonna do at that time it's just go and ( you know ) get involved in something there and somebody links on and some other people link on and go do some other things with them ( you know ) with us and then we wind up ( you know ) doing the same thing
-	-
counselor.res	it's like one thing leads to the next thing
client.fn	( i i smoke ) i drink ( and smoke ) and smoke
client.fn	i never ( you know ) shot no drugs or touched their needles
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.af	well ( that's ) that's a good thing yeah
client.fn	[nvv]
-	-
client.r+n7	( it doesn't ) it doesn't stop the fact that ( you know i ) i need more help ( uh um ) with the drug situation
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.res	okay you need some more you want some more support
client.fn	you know
-	-
client.fn	what is that

client.o+7	support
client.o+7	yes
client.o+7	yes
client.fn	that's
-	-
client.o+7	yes definitely
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quc	can you
counselor.gi	i'm interested
counselor.quo	tell me
counselor.res	( um ) you say that's ( you feel ) when you feel discouraged ( um ) and you may meet up with somebody and one thing leads to another and then you use ( um )
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( then i just ) then i yeah ( you know you know ) when you have no money ( you ) you all get ( like i get ) sometime ( i get ) when i get real rational and didn't wanna ( uh ) wait around sometime i wait until somebody else comes
client.r-a7	[cough] it's ( sort ) sort of ( like ) an ongoing thing once you get on it ( it ) it's hard to get off [yawn]
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r-a7	[nvv] excuse me once you're on it it's hard to get off
client.r-a7	and when you're on it sometimes it lasts for days ( you know ) and ( it ) it's hard to get off
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-7	and ( you know ) [du] get all these withdrawals and tired
counselor.res	once you start
counselor.res	it's hard to stop
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and ( you know ) thank god i'm not ( too ) too suicidal

-	-
client.fn	i just i don't know if i ( um ) i know i fit in this criteria ( you know ) really ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	because ( um you know ) sometime i feel like ( i get m* ) i get hopeless sometimes ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	sure
client.o+7	and ( uh ) i just need the help
client.o+7	so i just like i said i've been asking around [du] [yawn] [du] could go ( um ) to n_a and a_a meetings
client.o+7	so ( you know ) i grab a little book ( like ) they have a little booklet ( you know ) so ( uh uh )
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	uh-huh

counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+7	and i don't wanna meet people i don't wanna see ( you know )
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.rec	so you've you're got a pretty good idea about wanting to stop and the consequences ( of ) of using and that it's hard to stop when you start and i mean those are some negative things and you've listed ( a whole ) a whole bunch of them
client.o+7	mm-hmm
client.o+7	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	it sounds like the problem is what do you do now
counselor.quc	i mean have you thought about
counselor.gi	i mean other than the things that you've mentioned
client.fn	well
-	-
client.o+7	( you know ) like i said i was telling her i wanna go into treatment
client.r-7	but ( you know uh ) it's supposed to [yawn] [du] it's a process where you have to ( um you know ) waiting list to get on

-	-
counselor.af	yeah and ( you uh you know ) you're doing the right things to get involved in those programs
counselor.su	and i know as you say it's frustrating because ( it ) sometimes it can take a little bit of time to get in
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.c+7	mm-hmm so i'm not giving up i'm gonna still keep trying
-	-
counselor.quc	any other ideas about where to get the kinda support you need or how to get involved in treatment
client.fn	oh just
-	-
client.o+7	like i say there's ( like um ) we get our we ( s* ) i see a lot of people and we ( the the ) the rooms get a lot of people that pretty much ( you know ) know certain things about recovery and how to recover

counselor.fa	right
client.o+7	( you know wh* ) not to be ( you know um ) how do you say it most of the ( you know ) time when i'm not so free ( you know ) don't get so complacent and ( you know ) just find if you don't even wanna go to a meeting go
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so [laugh] there's been times i'm like 'i ain't going don't even wanna go'
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.rec	that's kinda the best time to go is when
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.o+7	when i don't want to go
-	-
counselor.rec	because those are the times when you may feel discouraged
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	but sometimes i
-	-
client.fn	i go and it's ( i'm i'm ) i'm doing all the wrong sometimes the wrong thing instead of just listening read the book
client.o+7	i got a big book right ( and i ) and i read that and try to get this thing going
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.c+7	( like ) like i say i'm not giving up
-	-
counselor.af	good well ( i ) i ( find ) certainly find that encouraging that you're not giving up
client.fn	yeah
counselor.af	and i can hope ( you can you can uh um like ) maybe accept some of that when you're feeling discouraged that ( you you um ) you have got a lot of motivation for change and you're doing what you need to do
client.fn	mm
client.fn	mm
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) i was wondering ( becau* be* ) because you did all that paperwork ( um you know ) and ( s* ) part of that paperwork was ( um ) the screening test
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	which scores people on ( um ) kind of a severity or risk scale here
client.fn	mm
counselor.gi	and just so i can share this with you just so you know just for your information ( you know this ) this test that you took was given to thousands and thousands of people
client.fn	okay
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	and then they ( um ) people their risk their risk for harm ( um ) due to their drug uses is rated on this scale from one to ten or zero to ten
client.fn	okay
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	zero is no risk and ( um ) it kinda goes up and you can look at it [du] one to two is some risk three to five's moderate risk and six to ten's severe risk
counselor.gi	and ( uh ) in terms of risk they mean problems that you may have medically ( um ha* ) injuries to yourself mental health emotional consequences
client.fn	[du]
-	-
counselor.res	and you've talked to me already about some of these consequences that you've experienced
client.r+7	yeah
counselor.gi	but in terms of ( your ) your ( um ) score ( you ) your score was a nine which put you up in the ( s* ) severe risk rating
counselor.rec	and it sounds like you already have a sense of that to me
client.r+7	yeah
counselor.af	yeah and you're ready to make a change and i tell you ( you're doing ) you're doing the things that you need to do
client.fn	mm
client.c+7	yeah i am

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( to ta* um just for ) just for me and my husband to talk about ( uh ) what we were gonna do before we heard our bad news from ( our ) our daughter
-	-
client.fn	because we were having this difficult time together
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but now we've put our problems aside and we have to take care of our kids and [du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so then when my anxiety went really up high i was ( like ) worried and i was really nervous and ( it's like and i had a um ) i took ( um ) tylenol_p_m because ( we ) we were arguing so much he went out of control and then took a bunch of ( you know ) handful of tylenol_p_m and then it's just ( like ) crazy
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and then ( he um ) right after i took it he [du] the father of my kids my husband took me to the emergency room to get help
client.fn	( and ) and then ( he uh ) i was ( like ) really [du] so i couldn't figure out where i was at first and then ( but uh ) i knew where i was i was at the harborview_hospital emergency room
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and then they made me stay there for a couple days and released me after a couple days
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( then ) since then i was mostly ( like ) i had a lot of anxiety
client.fn	so it's like i don't know what's ( it'll like ) i have a feeling that ( like ) if i did some ( like you know ) when i
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( i i ) i don't have a friend at all
client.fn	i used to have friends but ( uh they ) we lost contact and stuff and not ( you know ) [du] and stuff we lost contact
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and then just ( you know ) going through our lives and ( you know ) forget about finding ( uh ) friends and talk ( and ) and social and stuff so i blocked from that for a long time
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	so ( i mean )
client.r-2	with the drugs yeah that can comfort me a little bit ( like ) numb the problem a little bit
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+2	but ( you know ) there's still a problem ( you know ) there to live through
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	and it's bad yeah
client.o-2	i don't do it every day or ( like ) constantly i just do it ( you know ) when i [du] needed something to calm me down my anxieties and worriness and stuff like that
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.su	so ( i mean ) given what you've described just going through so much having yeah i mean it's kind of parents' worst fear right
client.fn	isn't it
counselor.rec	and then on top of that ( you know ) relationship dynamics ( um )
-	-
counselor.nc	[du]
client.fn	we've been together for ( like ) twelve years
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah and maybe too ( s* ) it sounds like you're also saying that you feel isolated and you don't really have the support
client.fn	( i ) i did in a way
client.fn	but i was working for six months and that made me feel a little better a lot better than before because i'm not isolated and a stay at home mom all the time
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i was working and taking care of the kids and still ( uh ) have free time to go out and be social [du] ( it was ) it was fun it was good
client.fn	and now just take care of the kids and be home mom
-	-
counselor.rec	mm and it sounds like you had hit a point too where you felt so overwhelmed that you actually ended up taking some tylenol and ending up in the hospital
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	( um ) so obviously you've seen ( a ) really a lot of anxiety right
client.fn	yeah i get a lot of anxiety
-	-
counselor.su	yeah and ( it's ) it's a lot to deal with sure
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	( um ) and so i think you had mentioned ( uh ) smoking marijuana
client.fn	mm-hmm marijuana
counselor.rec	so that's the substance the main substance you use
client.fn	[du]
counselor.quc	okay ( um ) and anything else or
-	-
client.fn	well ( oc* like when i have like ) when i ( get a ) get a prescribed ( um like ) pain medicine like vicodin or tylenol codeine because i had a oral surgery done and that's what i take pain medicine for and ( um ) i ( don't have ) don't take that anymore
client.r-2	and just taking ( um uh ) marijuana ( once in a ) once in a while ( to ) for my anxiety
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	okay so
counselor.res	for
client.fn	it isn't prescribed to me but [du] buy it and [du] friend and [du]
-	-
counselor.rec	and so you had mentioned that on the one hand ( when y* ) it helps with your anxiety ( um ) but you also notice ( the ) it doesn't make the problem go away
client.r+2	it doesn't go away no
client.r-2	( it it ) i'll want to it's just ( when i ha* when ) when the system is in me system in me [nvv] i won't feel anything
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+2	but when it wears off i'll go back [du]
-	-
counselor.res	so it's like a numbing
client.r-2	numbing
counselor.rec	kind of a distraction if you're feeling a little overwhelmed
client.r-2	yeah
counselor.rec	( um ) and ( so ) so it sounds like that's one of the things that sort of feels good about it
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	( um ) is there anything else about smoking that you sort of feels good for you
client.fn	mm
-	-
client.r-2	mm it ( just a* ) just calms me numbing stuff like that
-	-
counselor.quc	okay ( um ) in terms of any drawbacks have you seen any kinda negative sides to it or
-	-
client.o-2	[du] so no negative feelings about it
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so for you its just main concern then is that ( um ) the problem is still there
-	-
client.fn	it's still there it's still there
client.r+2	but ( you know ) it's not gonna go away just because ( i had ) i had marijuana ( you know ) it's still be there and still have to deal with it
client.fn	but that's life ( you know ) that's how it goes
client.o-2	and ( and you know ) i try not ( to ) to show it to our kids
client.fn	but ( you know ) i do go through our lives like that
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.res	and you said that you guys have started counseling
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	we're in counseling because of ( the um ) my daughter
-	-
counselor.quc	okay and ( has that ) do you feel like that's been helping out a little bit in terms with your anxiety as well
-	-
client.fn	not yet
client.fn	( s* ) we haven't got deeply into that yet ( but ) but we're starting to
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	so the beginning stages still
client.fn	[du] stages
counselor.res	kind of like a meet greet
-	-
client.fn	yeah mostly about my daughter because ( she ) she been having some bad dreams about it
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	[du] because she had to go through ( like um t* ) talk to the detective and video recording and stuff like that to tell what happened
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	so ( she uh she doesn't wa* she ) sometimes she doesn't want to talk about it all
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	and so you're meeting with a counselor to sort of come up with a plan that ( um ) you and ( um ) your kids' dad can kind of put together
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	( so do you um ) so i guess ( you know ) given that you describe sort of when you smoke it really helps with your anxiety
counselor.quo	( um ) how do you think things would be different if your anxiety was more something that you felt like you had control over
-	-
client.o+2	if i could get control of it some other way ( than ) than marijuana i'll totally go for it
-	-
counselor.quo	you would totally
-	-
client.o+2	go for it whatever ( it not without ) without using marijuana and try to relieve my anxiety i'll do it yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	so for you at this point it's ( you know ) sometimes people describe it as a recreational thing
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	but for you it's almost like it's ( uh ) medicating anxiety ( um ) but if you saw yourself with less anxiety then marijuana wouldn't really be as necessary
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.o+2	not necessary at all
-	-
counselor.quo	okay and i guess ( um ) where do you see you and your family in five years' time
-	-
client.fn	mm [du] a wish that we own our home with a back yard and have a pet with because my kids love dogs
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and [du] happy family and married to my husband officially
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	yeah and my kids will go to the high school and get good grades and everything
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm [laugh] well ( it's a ) yeah it's very clear how much love and attention that you've given to your family and how important they are good for you
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	my oldest my son told straight to us what ( what she ) what he heard from his sister
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	that we were there to talk whatever they needed to talk about that it's important
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.su	yeah and i think ( the ) the fact that you're getting services and that you're trying to figure out as a family how to support her is huge
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	i think that actually ( um ) helps a lot when ( you know ) kids report having a situation that they've experienced like that that can be upsetting
client.fn	yes
-	-
client.fn	yeah i know there's other kids that don't say anything at all to their parents because ( you know ) they might think it's wrong or something
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but our kids we always tell them whenever has something going on just don't worry ( you know ) just come to us and talk
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	we'll be there
-	-
counselor.su	yeah i can see it's a very yeah very painful difficult topic
counselor.af	but and i can also see how much you guys are really trying to pull together ( um ) to support her which i think is wonderful
-	-
client.fn	we try but it's [du]
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	and i think again unfortunetly ( you know ) abuse can happen but to have ( you know ) the love and support of family and that structure is ( really what ) a really huge protective thing for a lot of kids
counselor.af	so and it's great that she did talk to you guys about it
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	the worst thing was that the guy was living in my mother-in-law's house as a tenant
client.fn	and we used to live there with them ( for ) until a year and a half ago when we moved out to our own apartment
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( and ) and we'd be just going there to visit her
client.fn	( but ) and last time they were there was ( um ) before christmas and ( you know ) who knows what happened
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	( just ) just it makes me sick [du] to talk about it
-	-
counselor.quc	and so do you feel like the counseling that you're gonna be receiving ideally would help a little bit with the anxiety
client.fn	( i ) hopefully it'll help
-	-
client.fn	( if i if ) if i still have trouble or problem i'll continue to try to find more help ( about ) with my doctors already but [du] from
-	-
counselor.quc	have you ever ( um ) been on any medication for anxiety
-	-
client.fn	no no anxiety just ( uh ) depression pills that i recieved last month
client.fn	but ( um ) i've been taking it but ( it's making ) the side effects is worse than my depression
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	it's like i have to ( get it go to go [du] ) go and talk to my doctor and talk about what else i ( you know ) other than what that medication [err]
client.fn	because it's horrible side effects
-	-
counselor.rec	so the ( medication that you're the depression ) antidepressant right now is actually making it's not worth it
client.fn	it's ( uh ) it's not
client.fn	( worth ) worth it
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	if the no no but the caffeine is [du] helping me a little bit caffeine with coffee
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	coffee seems to work a little
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but it's like when the caffeine wears off it's like going back [du]
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	but
-	-
counselor.res	and it feels like you [du]
client.fn	yeah but
counselor.res	and i think you had said too that ( you would uh ) in addition to the counseling you would also potentially consider talking to someone about anxiety as well
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( um ) [du] i scheduled to see a mental clinic psychiatric
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( um ) but ( uh ) i had to reschedule because ( i had to ) we had to go to see ( um ) a detective ( um ) in king_county
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so we had to cancel it so i have to make another appointment to talk to them again
-	-
counselor.rec	but that isn't something that you had had sort of
client.fn	( that was that was um ) the reason that i needed to make appointment because of the overdose i had
-	-
counselor.res	okay so it was in relation to the overdose okay
counselor.gi	and ( um ) so i guess ( you know ) when people think about their drug use there's all sorts of different ( um ) ways in which people can approach it so in terms of whether or not they wanna change
counselor.gi	( for some people ) for a lot of people it's like you know actually yeah i don't really see any problems with what is going on or i'm pretty happy with how things are and i'm just gonna kind of stick to how it's going and not really change my use
-	-
counselor.gi	for some people it's cutting down a little bit ( um ) whatever cutting down might mean for them personally
counselor.gi	for some people it might be okay well i'm just gonna make sure that i use in a safe way
counselor.gi	so maybe not ( you know ) drink and drive or maybe not ( you know ) smoke and drive
counselor.gi	( um ) and then for some people ( um you know ) it might be trying to quit completely but ( you know ) knowing there might be a slip here and there
-	-
counselor.gi	and then ( you know for ) finally for another set of people it's completely stopping that's it completely done
counselor.quo	so where would you say that you would fall on that right now
client.fn	i could fall
-	-
client.o+2	mm closely to ( f* ) cutting down cutting down
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so by cutting down it sounds like you were thinking ( you know ) use occasionally but ( um ) not use as much
-	-
client.o-2	yeah occasionally ( not ) not as much as ( uh you know ) other people think but occasionally
client.o-2	( like you know once in a like ) twice a week maybe i don't know exactly but yeah occasionally
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	okay and it seems like what you had said too is maybe if there were other ways that you could help deal with your anxiety ( um ) then ( it ) smoking weed wouldn't necessarily be something that would be as necessary all the time
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	( um ) and so if you had to rate it on a one to ten scale with one being not at all and ten being extremely how confident would you be at this point ( um ) to be able to start working towards that goal
-	-
client.fn	five
-	-
counselor.res	okay so higher than a two or three ( um )
client.fn	i rated it higher higher than a two or three yes
counselor.quo	okay so ( what ) what do you think it would take for you to get like a six
-	-
client.o+2	mm no [du] change it to six
client.r+a2	( i could do it ) i could do it
client.o+2	just to ( you know ) keep my mind on top of it and [du] ( you know ) get stronger and do whatever i could do ( i'll ) i'll do it
client.o+2	if i keep my mind onto it i'll do it ( if i ) yeah if i try hard yeah i would
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so is it more just sort of kind of making up your mind to do it that's what it sounds like
client.fn	make up
client.fn	( my ) yeah my mind
-	-
counselor.rec	okay but once you made up your mind ( you ) it sounds like you'd be pretty confident that you'd be able to see it through
-	-
client.o+2	i should be able to yeah if i keep my mind to it [du] do it
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	well ( um ) would it be okay with you if i give you a call in about a week's time just to check in and say hello see if you have any questions for me see if anything kinda came up with this
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	okay
counselor.quc	( um ) and so let me see if i can get your number
-	-
client.fn	two_oh_six two_four_five_zero_two_five_seven
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

counselor.res	zero_two_five_seven
counselor.rec	okay ( um ) and so again ( it just you know ) from our talk it sounds like you had obviously ( a ) a lot going on in the past few months that have been really intense and it's kinda caused ( um ) a higher level of anxiety ( uh ) which has sort of been part of the reason why you've been medicating a little bit with marijuana ( um )
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah and ( it was uh ) this christmas was my ( um ) first christmas without my grandma that she raised me until i was sixteen
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	my grandparents raised me [du] sixteen because my mom was working my dad passed away when i was four
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( you know ) i was living with her for until sixteen so they were really close to me
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah it sounds like kind of almost losing parent right
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.su	it's very difficult on top of everything else that's been going on as well
counselor.rec	but it also sounds like you ( um you know ) are kind of in counseling for ( um ) what happened with your daughter and then also eventually have an appointment for mental health counseling ( um ) to sort of address maybe depression and anxiety
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	[du] to that yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	and the goal that you sort of see yourself having is ideally maybe not having as much anxiety so then you could ( manage your ) cut down your use a little bit so it's a little more occasional maybe ( like ) once or twice a week
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.st	okay ( um ) well yeah if ( um ) i can give you a call next week just to check in and see if you've been thinking a little bit about that goal and [du] ( you know ) and how you've been doing in general so

counselor.gi	that's a lot of people though that is a lot of people
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	i don't think we could house that many people in this town [du] i'm just saying that i don't know
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.quc	so are you involved with this or
-	-
client.ts+7	( i i've been going you know ) i go to a meeting a week okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( uh ) they're telling me to do a lot of things ( you know you know ) suggestions ( you know ) not forcing me
client.fn	and they say get to a group that you're gonna like and be comfortable with
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so i've been going to both n_a and a_a ( you know ) and i go only once a week and i try not to go too far ( you know ) from where i live
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.r+d7	and so sooner or later ( you know ) because i really want this thing to work ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-7	i mean i have done it before but like everything else ( i ) i've ruined it
counselor.fa	mm
client.o-7	( you know ) it's kinda like what my mother used to tell me that i was never gonna amount up to any good anyway so ( you know ) don't worry about it ( you know ) so i just ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.quc	so ( what which ) what drugs are you using
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) alcohol mostly ( you know ) and marijuana
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-5	and ( uh when i was working you know ) when i was working ( it would uh ) i would take speed ( you know ) it would keep me going ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.quc	how long ago was that
client.fn	oh it's been a while it's been a while for speed ( you know )
client.r+2	but marijuana and alcohol it's ( like you know ) off and on ( you know ) when i'm broke just forget it ( you know i'm ) i'm manageable with my money ( you know )
client.fn	and ( uh that ) that's how i i guess ( you know ) [du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.r+d7	but ( uh ) i think the bottom line is i don't like the use of drugs anymore
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	( you know um ) my social worker because of whatever i was going through whatever i needed to take she gave me ( uh ) i had to see a doctor to get the [du] prescription
client.fn	and this was going on for over two years and i would never take them i'd start out to take them and then i'd just ( you know ) i don't like taking pills ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and ( uh like ) i was really having a problem sleeping i mean i just could not sleep
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right right
client.fn	and they gave me these pills and i took them just the way they wanted me to take them and they ( like ) yuck ( they were ) they just didn't work ( you know it just )
client.fn	and i kept telling them i said 'well don't you think it had to do with me using drugs all the time to where they didn't work no more'
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	i said have you ever heard of that ( you know ) and i don't know nobody seems to understand that ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i don't think they work for me anymore
client.r+a7	i can't get loaded anymore i can't get drunk anymore because i've taken all my life ( you know ) since a teenager
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.quo	so how does that make you feel ( if you ) if you can't
-	-
client.o-7	well if i knew i could get loaded booom i'd be at it again
counselor.quo	get
-	-
counselor.fa	really really yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.r+7	but then when i found i know what it does to me i'm a doctor_jeckyll and mister_hyde ( you know ) i just change
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+d7	so what i'm wanting to do now i want to change my life
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	( you know i ) i
client.fn	[du]
counselor.quo	and how do you want to do that
-	-
client.o+7	well i think the start is going to meetings again ( you know ) and doing it this time with the intention ( to ) to get better ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm mm-hmm
client.r+d7	and so that's what i wanna do
-	-
counselor.quc	( is so y* when you ) you said that you used speed up until a year ago
counselor.quc	or ( recent uh ) six months ago or
client.r-d5	yeah ( when i ) when i'm
client.r-d5	working ( you know i ) i wanna take it ( you know )
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.quc	( when ) when was the last time you worked
-	-
client.fn	ooh i'd say last year around ( uh ) july
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	so you haven't used speed for
-	-
client.fn	for almost a year
counselor.res	for almost a year
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	over a year actually
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	( and you inte* ) did you intentionally quit that
counselor.quc	or did you was that a plan quitting
client.fn	yeah yeah
client.fn	that i intentionally quit
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r+5	and ( that i you know i was just you know ) i just had no use for it
-	-
counselor.quo	and how did you plan that
counselor.quo	how did you make that happen
-	-
client.r+5	well because i think the bottom line is i wasn't working ( you know ) i didn't have to get up in the morning ( you know ) to go to work
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-5	and if i had to get up in the morning i need it ( you know ) and that would be the only reason why i'd need it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+5	and then when i'd get home ( you know uh ) depending on how much i took i would have to take some downers ( you know ) ( you know ) or drink to ( you know ) pass out
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and don't laugh but well it is funny
client.fn	( you know ) i saved all the cans that i drank ( you know ) and i would pile them up on the door and they're all the way to the ceiling and it's a little taller in my apartment and i had ( like ) two little [du] on both sides
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	and these guys didn't believe me and i said 'no no they're all empties' ( you know )
-	-
client.fn	'no they're not' i said 'yes they are they're empties' 'well why do you [du]' 'oh i don't know i wanna show off what i drink i don't know'
client.fn	( you know ) and then ( they ) they never fail they go out there and ( they ) they take one and oh you're right it's empty ( you know ) it was silly ( you know )
-	-
counselor.quc	mm do you still do that
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
client.nc	[laugh]
counselor.res	no no more no more
counselor.af	so you were able to just decide not to take the speed ( and the when you quit ) when you ( s* ) quit working
client.fn	right yeah
counselor.quc	if you were working would you still need the speed though
-	-
client.r+5	well ( you know ) i don't think so ( you know ) because ( uh ) from what i'm hearing ( you know ) that 'if you're off of it why don't you just leave it alone ( you know you know ) you're doing fine without it so why start over again'
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	and ( tha* ) how do you feel about that
-	-
client.o+5	i feel good about that
-	-
counselor.res	okay so you agree with that statement yeah yeah
client.o+5	oh yeah yeah yeah
counselor.st	so now we get to the marij*
client.fn	it's not
client.fn	like i hadn't heard it before [du]
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	( but you ) but it sounds like ( th* ) right now there's sort of a difference ( that you ) that you're believing it now
client.r+5	yeah ( like ) i feel good that i can ( you know ) say no ( you know ) and i'm not lying ( you know ) i'm telling the truth ( you know )
counselor.fa	huh
counselor.res	that you
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
counselor.af	that's good
-	-
counselor.af	that's good that's really positive thing for you
client.fn	so
client.fn	( you know )
client.o-7	( but i* i* you know ) i don't know if you ever heard this before but ( you know ) the meetings i go to i really don't like ( you know like ) i see a lot of me in them and it's excuse my language it's just all bullshit
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah but now where do you live
counselor.quc	you live
-	-
client.fn	i live here at the frye_apartments up on the hill there
counselor.res	okay so you're
-	-
counselor.res	going to meetings just in the downtown area

client.fn	downtown area
-	-
counselor.quc	do you go up to meetings up at harborview or
-	-
client.fn	no i haven't gone there
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	no
counselor.quc	i'm wondering if it's like
client.fn	[clears throat] excuse me
counselor.res	you said earlier at the meetings they tell you to go to different meetings to find the right fit
client.fn	right
counselor.quc	and perhaps downtown
-	-
client.fn	well ( uh ) i don't know if this is gonna make any difference to you but i'm wanting to go into ( bus* ) business for myself
client.fn	( you know ) i don't know if you know anything about food processing or anything like that but ( uh ) i've been around the restaurant trade all my life
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i finally figured out this one type of food that everybody likes i don't care who you are or what nationality everybody likes
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and i figured out a way to make it into a pie
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	and i'm thinking ( uh ) when football season starts i'm gonna give it a shot
client.fn	i'm trying not to put too much money into it but if it goes and it works out then the next thing i'm gonna have to do is get me some wheels
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	then i'll be able to really really ( you know ) go to work on it
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	but in the meantime i'm gonna just ( you know ) without trying to spend a lot of money but that's what i'm gonna do
client.o+7	but because of that i think this is where i'm getting serious about my life now
-	-
counselor.res	okay so because you have this goal to have your new business that's why you're trying to
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah normally i don't think like that
counselor.gi	so
-	-
counselor.quo	about the marijuana tell me ( how that ) how that's affecting your life right now
-	-
client.r+2	well excuse me well ( you know ) i just i just don't feel that i could ( you know ) use and keep conscious ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah i betcha marijuana would kinda mess with you a little bit [laugh] more ( if ) particularly if you
client.fn	[du]
client.r+2	[du] slows me down ( you know ) slows me down
client.r+2	and ( you know ) i used to say oh i can have great sex oh well i haven't had no sex but i don't believe all that ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-1	( uh you know ) i know the alcohol that was my medication and that was my pill to go to sleep
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

-	-
client.r-2	get high [du] yeah get high feel good
counselor.quc	that's it
client.r-2	( you know ) relax ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( uh ) [du]
counselor.quo	( and what )
counselor.quo	and then what do you use the alcohol for
-	-
client.r-1	( uh ) uh get drunk ( you know ) [du]
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-1	( you know ) i don't have to worry about it
client.r+1	until i wake up tomorrow morning
counselor.quc	is there any
client.r-1	and i'm one of the i don't know if you ever heard of this but ( i i'm ) i'm one of them functioning alcoholics in other words ( uh ) well since i've been here i've never lost a job
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.quc	in seattle or
-	-
client.fn	right in seattle
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
client.fn	( you know ) and vegas is not like this at all it's too cruel down there you gotta really be tough
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.quo	so what would be the advantages to giving up say the marijuana
counselor.res	since it gives you the high
-	-
client.r+7	( i i think ) i think with all of it ( it it'll just ) it'll just make me a better person
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+7	and ( i might ) my goals will be accomplished
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+7	( you know uh i ) i think i'll just be a new person ( you know ) i really do
counselor.quc	have you
counselor.quc	cut back recently or
-	-
client.r+7	well ( uh ) i think the bottom line is ( uh ) i just can't afford it
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+7	( you know ) and then where i'm at ( uh it really ) i'm really ( uh ) what's the word i wanna use ( uh ) i just don't wanna be involved with anybody down there at the frye ( you know ) i don't want them to come over to my place
counselor.quo	at
counselor.res	at the frye okay
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) the women are crazier than i am ( you know ) all they want is money ( you know and ) and i tell them just don't come over to my place
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like you wanna kind of cut back on the marijuana use and maybe the alcohol use so that you can save some money
client.r+1	yeah well i'm gonna have to save [du]
client.fn	[du]
counselor.res	and feel like a better person
client.r+1	right
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.r+7	yeah because ( i ) i know in order to do that ( i have to ) i have to leave that alone
counselor.res	you have to lea*
client.fn	you know i've gone to a lot of meetings off and on all of my life and i have seen people that i looked up to ( you know ) i've seen people that i didn't really believe ( you know ) stopped and i said gee if i could only do that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	you didn't believe that they had stopped
client.fn	no
-	-
client.fn	and if i could only look like them ( you know ) so i go out of my way on a payday and buy all these new clothes [du] 'oh i feel clean' ( you know ) and ( i ) i was lying ( you know )
counselor.quc	and pretend
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	because you thought they were lying yeah
client.fn	yeah right ( you know )
counselor.quc	do you think they were now
counselor.quc	or do you think it was just
-	-
client.fn	well ( i i ) i think the bottom line ( you know ) is that ( i ) i'm going to the wrong meetings because ( these ) these people are really
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	so what would be the advantage of going to a meeting all dressed up and
-	-
client.fn	there is none
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i think that's what i could really appreciate about any of the twelve step programs is that you could go like a bum you could look like a bum you could act like you could be a bum and they'll allow you to go in there ( you know )
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.res	so you like that part of the twelve steps
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	right
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	yeah it's not a church
-	-
counselor.quc	is that how you would plan on cutting back on your marijuana use or
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) because ( you know i ) i just really feel that ( if i have ) if i do what they suggest that i'll get better
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	( and ) excuse me excuse me and what they're really telling me more than anything else is they say that i gotta go every day ( you know ) and i don't go every day
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) ( and uh ) but i know that ( it might ) it might be possible for me to go ( you know ) but not every day ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.quo	( how would you ch* ) how would you change that
counselor.quo	how would you go about ( doing it ) going every day if that
counselor.res	it sounds like you would like to go every day
counselor.quc	( it's ) have you thought about a way to do that or
-	-
client.fn	well ( you know ) i know that if i really get serious with my life and i go into this business that i'm really planning to do then i won't be able to go maybe once a week ( you know ) to a good meeting
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	and i know i'll have transportation where maybe i could go every other day
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah ( s* ) so is transportation what keeps you from going ( every ) every day now
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	what other things keep you from going every day now
-	-
client.fn	mm gee what other things
client.fn	( uh ) i don't know i just think i'm lazy minded does that make any sense
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.su	yeah trust me i think we all have that feeling a lot of time
client.fn	[laugh] yeah
client.fn	feel better
client.nc	[laugh]
counselor.gi	( you know ) yeah i think ( that's a big ) that's a big thing
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	but ( you know do you have w* ) have you ever had ways that you've overcome that or thought about that
-	-
client.fn	well ( uh you know i never ) i've never ( you know ) lost any weight ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( uh ) i can't get into my pants anymore ( you know ) ( my my s* my you know ) my jeans or anything ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and so i don't like diets because when i go on a diet my body throws a riot ( you know ) so i don't diet okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.c+7	so i think what i'll end up doing is just ( it's gonna ) it's gonna really help me altogether if i just stop using if i ( s* ) really take the program seriously and ( uh you know ) try to go to a meeting every day try you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	so are you smoking marijuana every day
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.quc	are you drinking every day
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.quc	okay how often are you smoking the marijuana
-	-
client.fn	well it's been a good eighteen days and maybe twenty
counselor.fa	oh
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	okay
counselor.quc	so how many times a month do you think you smoke
-	-
client.r-2	well when i can afford it every day
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	sounds like money is a big motivator money and yeah
client.fn	every day
client.fn	and then
client.r+2	( you know ) the other thing is too and it's very seriously ( uh ) you can't buy good weed
client.r+2	[du] you found a good dealer then ( it's ) you could buy good weed and usually when you do that it's gonna cost more
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+2	and you get this stuff they sell on the street every day ( like ) where i live ( you know ) i'll never buy there because i know better
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+2	( you know ) so i think that's what's cutting me off
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+n7	( you know ) i really believe that ( you know ) but wouldn't i be a liar or wouldn't i be a hypocrite if i was saying to you that i want to go into business for myself ( you know ) and ( it's ) i think that's what the motivation is and that's where it's gonna have to come to a halt
counselor.fa	yeah yeah yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	( and i* ) so what you're ( saying ) asking me is if you would be lying if you didn't cut back everything ( and try ) because you really wanna go into business for yourself
client.fn	right
client.fn	right
client.fn	right
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r+7	( you know they ) i don't know if it's true or not but they say everything [cough] excuse me ( you know ) they say everything starts to s* ( you know ) get good in your life ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+n7	and ( uh ) so i know that all this is gonna have to go away if i really want that ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and if anything i wanna move out where i'm at now
counselor.quo	if it didn't work what would happen
counselor.quo	if your business plan for this next big one didn't work what would happen
counselor.quo	what would you do ( if ) if that happened
-	-
client.fn	i would probably go into a suicidal mode again or getting depressed or something
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	but you know what the way i'm thinking i don't think it's gonna happen because i
counselor.af	okay good
-	-
client.fn	[du]

counselor.adw	( it always is it's a ) you should look at in business like that as sort of a chance to relearn
client.fn	well ( i ) i know it takes a year for any restaurant to even think of making it until after that year
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	then they can start comparing notes day by day
counselor.gi	( but that ) but ( i* ) it's never a failure as long as you've tried it's never a failure

counselor.gi	yeah so basically part of our study is looking at ( um ) drug use behavior ( you know ) for the next year basically
counselor.ec	( um ) so i'm here to talk to you about what that has looked like for you in the past and how you want it to look
counselor.gi	( um ) my goal is not to get you to change or to go to treatment or anything like that
counselor.gi	we're actually just interested in hearing ( like ) your perspective on it and what you think what you've been doing stuff like that
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	so ( um ) yeah i guess it sounds like ( you're ) you're using
client.fn	boring as hell
counselor.quo	the what
-	-
client.fn	boring as hell
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah [laugh]
client.nc	[laugh]
counselor.gi	that's exactly what i was gonna say
counselor.gi	no ( uh ) so it sounds like ( uh ) marijuana and ( uh ) some cocaine but ( not ) not recently
client.fn	no
counselor.quo	yeah so ( uh what do you ) what do you want to talk about with regards to ( marir* ) marijuana and your use and
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) you got any we'll smoke a joint
counselor.gi	[laugh] no
-	-
client.fn	( i [nvv] ) like i told her ( you know i've ) i've smoked pot for forty years
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.c-2	and i'm not gonna quit
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-d2	( you know ) and i don't wanna quit
counselor.gi	there you go
client.o-2	so ( you know ) [du] ( you know ) if i smoke pot once every ten days
client.c-2	then ( i'm not ) i'm not gonna give that up
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah so for you it's kind of like something you've done for a really long time it's not really a problem
client.fn	yeah
client.o-2	and it's not something i do every day ( you know )
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r-d2	and ( i just ) i love the hell out of it when i do it ( you know ) so
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.quo	so ( why ) why do you use
counselor.quo	or how did that
-	-
client.fn	why do i use it
counselor.gi	uh-huh
client.r-2	because ( it ) it's ( it ) very relaxing very calming
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( uh i ) i used to say that i used alcohol ( to ) to relax and to calm down
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+1	well alcohol no more made me relaxed and calm ( than ) than anything
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r-2	but when i smoke a joint i just get that mellow nice feeling and it's cool
-	-
client.r-2	( i smoke or ) when i drink ( uh ) it's not a mellow ( it d* it doesn't ) it doesn't make me euphoric like smoking a joint
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r+1	so that's pretty much why ( i just you know ) i just kinda gave up drinking
counselor.gi	so
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	and ( uh ) so yeah i don't
counselor.quc	so for you ( uh ) pot kind of came in almost instead of alcohol or
-	-
client.fn	in the last six months yeah yeah
counselor.fa	oh okay
client.fn	( you know i i ) i didn't smoke for a while
client.r+d1	and then i just drinking ( was just it ) just wasn't fun anymore you know
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r-d2	and so i started smoking ( and ) and i just really enjoyed it again ( you know )
client.fn	but like starting again
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah so for you it seems like the most important thing is kind of ( this ) this feeling good ( and ) and actually getting something out of it ( uh ) and it sounds like alcohol was not doing that for you
client.fn	yeah
client.r+1	no it wasn't
client.r+1	( wasn't ) wasn't doing it no
counselor.rec	( uh ) so this is almost i mean if i have you right this is almost part of your leaving alcohol is to
client.r-2	smoke a joint
counselor.res	smoke a joint
counselor.rec	so this is part of your
client.r-2	( ins* instead of )
-	-
client.r-2	instead of drinking a pint of vodka smoke a joint
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	( so ) so this is in your mind a lot better then
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah except for now i find out today that ( uh ) i gotta have a c_a_t_scan
client.r+2	i've been a cigarette smoker for forty years and they see little things growing ( so uh ) so that makes it a little hard to smoke pot now
counselor.su	oh gees
counselor.su	oh shoot
-	-
counselor.su	yeah i imagine that's a little scary
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	well it is real scary
client.r+2	but makes ( it you know ) you cough a little more when you take a hit
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah ( so ) so right now marijuana i mean it sounds like it was really fun but ( you're ) you're wondering how long you're gonna be able to do it
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah yeah
client.o-2	but [du] ( you know ) i can't come to that conclusion about the little things growing because it might be an infection it might
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	could be anything could be anything
client.fn	could be anything
-	-
client.fn	that's what she said
client.fn	so yeah so ( you know ) don't ( uh ) go buying chunks of marble yet
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	[laugh] yeah so it sounds like you're ( uh ) a little bit concerned about that but you don't want to jump to conclusions
client.fn	well ( you know ) [du] be concerned
client.fn	i'm
client.fn	i'm certainly
client.fn	not gonna lose any sleep over it
-	-
counselor.res	yeah yeah well you don't know right now ( um )
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and eighty_five percent of everything you worry about never happens
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	ten percent of everything you worry about somebody else has control over
client.fn	five percent of everything you worry about you wouldn't have to worry about if you fixed it when it happened
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so we spend our lives worrying about nothing
-	-
counselor.ec	so that five percent it sounds like that's the part that you're thinking you can have some control over yeah
client.fn	sure sure
client.fn	if you have problem that pops up if you fixed it when it popped up you'd never worry about the problem
client.fn	but most of us 'ahh i'll do it tomorrow' and then it becomes a problem and then you worry about it
counselor.af	right so for you you're the kind of guy that if something comes up as a problem you take action immediately
client.fn	fix it
-	-
client.fn	that way you don't ( you know )
counselor.fa	( uh )
client.fn	i mean yeah worry and jealousy are probably the most two worthless human emotions that we can have because they never do you any good
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	so for smoking is that what happened for you
counselor.quc	did it get to a point where you were like you don't want to do this anymore this is a problem
client.c+6	yeah
-	-
client.r+6	yeah yeah well i ( i s* ) had to start using one of those little inhalers ( get up ) get up in the morning i'd have to do the inhaler walk a couple blocks after using the inhaler and i said well i don't do this anymore and that's when i quit smoking
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.res	oh like a vaporizer
counselor.fa	oh
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	so ( i i ) i fixed that but i should have done that twenty_five years ago
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	see if it when it comes if you
-	-
counselor.rec	so you've learned some lessons that's ( like ) basically what you're saying too is that ( you know ) if this time something were to come up you'd stop yeah
client.fn	stop it
client.fn	oh yeah yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and
-	-
client.fn	yeah that's
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+2	yeah the last time i smoked pot i took a hit and i must have coughed for twenty minutes after i took a hit and i said 'well that's enough of that' so that's why it's been so long since i've even smoked pot
-	-
counselor.res	because ( it ) it kind of it hurt
client.r+2	it hurts
counselor.rec	uh-huh so that euphoric feeling kind of was outweighed by ( the ) the pain it sounds like yeah
client.r+2	yeah
client.r+2	yeah yeah
-	-
client.fn	so now i don't drink i don't smoke pot i don't smoke cigarettes
-	-
counselor.rec	so you're just looking for something to have enjoyment with [laugh] or that doesn't hurt
client.fn	well
client.r+a7	i wanna be bad but i can't ( you know )
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	yeah the only thing i do illegal is jaywalk and they don't even arrest you for that can't even get arrested
counselor.fa	ahh shoot
-	-
counselor.rec	well so you're looking to have fun it sounds like
client.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) i guess ( when it like when i get to ) i want to get this breathing stuff fixed so i can get back to work so i can just sit around doing nothing
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	so work is really important to you and getting back the and it sounds like breathing right and having this resolved is ( one ) one step towards that
client.fn	oh yeah yeah
-	-
client.fn	beginning a new [du] today so maybe that will really change things around
counselor.gi	oh yeah so i was kind of surprised when you were just talking and you said ( you ) you don't smoke pot anymore
counselor.quc	so is that kind of what this has all come to today this visit and ( um ) the hearing about your lungs
counselor.quc	is that kinda the decision you made
client.r+2	yeah
-	-
client.r+2	yeah yeah
counselor.su	gees
-	-
counselor.rec	it sounds like you really care about your body and ( your ) your future
client.fn	well ( i i )
-	-
client.r+7	yeah i do ( you know i ) i'm only sixty_one so i still have a few left but i'd like for them to be a healthy few ( you know ) i don't want to lay in bed for the last five years of my life because i'm ( you know ) ( yeah and ) ( yeah just uh ) yeah i've been too active all my life to do the last couple doing nothing
counselor.fa	yeah

counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	no one is gonna slow you down now

client.fn	so i think as soon as i get all this stuff figured out and taken care of i'm gonna go someplace where i can live on the beach again
-	-
counselor.af	yeah that sounds nice
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	so you're really motivated to kind of focus on your health right now this is ( like ) a big deal for you
client.r+7	oh it is a big deal
-	-
client.fn	yeah it is [du] my health was something i never i never worried about it before
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	( you know ) i ( never ) just never gave it a thought yeah it was something i never thought about i've just always been healthy just been healthy

counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	mm wow you don't really have access to the kind of foods you need to stay healthy

counselor.fa	wow
-	-
client.fn	where the hell do they get yellow cheese
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	( you know ) i thought cheese came from milk and i've never seen yellow milk
-	-
counselor.rec	so you're kind of struggling to get your health on track here given what resources you have available ( um )
-	-
client.fn	yeah oh and just thank god for this place
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know ) yeah because ( i ) i don't know what i'd do without them yeah ( this ) this place is really ( uh )

client.fn	so the thing
-	-
counselor.rec	[du] so it sounds like with ( uh ) the smoking then and kind of ( um ) marijuana that for you is kind of ( on a ) an easy decision because say 'no i can't do this anymore' but some of this other stuff is a little more difficult
-	-
client.r+a1	well ( um well ) to stop drinking wasn't that difficult ( you know )
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.af	that's impressive i mean ( for ) most people don't say that so
client.fn	i
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) i worked in the restaurant business for forty years
counselor.fa	oh wow
client.r-1	and ( you know ) you get off shifts and it's nothing to have half a dozen cocktails
counselor.fa	mm
client.r-1	( you know ) i mean ( it's a* ) it's part of life it's what you do
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+n1	( you know ) and ( uh ) man ( it just ) i just said well ' ( i just don't ) i just don't need this anymore'
-	-
client.r-1	i think what it was was for thirty_five years i never had a hangover
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r+1	and i woke up one day and my hair hurt [du] it's a hangover and i said oh my god what is this and it happened a couple more times and i said 'man i gotta' 'if that'
counselor.su	ugh
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i wasn't drinking that much ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r+1	but then again ( you know ) i'm sixty_one years old i'm not ( you know ) thirty_five
client.fn	and but yeah i just said i [du]
counselor.fa	right
client.r+1	and the last couple times i drank ( i drank ) i bought those little airplane bottles ( you know ) ( two or ) two or three of them and i was snockered i said whoa ( you know ) here's a guy that used to drink a quart of gin a day ( you know ) so i just
counselor.fa	oh okay
counselor.res	a little bit
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so you were just like 'i don't need this i'm done with this' and you're kind of returning to your health
client.r+n1	yeah
counselor.quc	and then for smoking is it the same process for you
counselor.quc	i mean smoking marijuana you're kind of at this point where you're like what
client.o-2	well ( if )
client.o-2	( if it didn't ) if it didn't hurt then i'd love to smoke
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+2	but ( it's ) if it hurts i'm not gonna smoke it ( you know ) ( it ) yeah yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	so pain is kind of outweighing a lot of this
client.r+2	yeah
-	-
client.r+d2	yeah it is you know that ( that when ) when you take that hit and you start coughing and for half an hour you cough yeah ( it's ) well it takes all the fun out of it

client.o-2	so ( y* ) yeah until something happens i guess i'll i don't know find somebody that bakes brownies so [du]
counselor.gi	there you go
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah well it sounds like you're thinking of other ways that you can still have fun but having it not damage ( your ) your health
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	( and ) and especially your lungs it sounds like are the part that's very painful smoking no mater what it is it sounds like it hurts
client.r+2	yeah
client.r+2	i think it ( i'm only ) i'm only utilizing thirty percent of my lung capacity so the other seventy percent is just there i'm not even using it

-	-
client.fn	so what else are we gonna talk about here
-	-
counselor.st	( um well ) well that's basically it
counselor.af	i mean ( i'm ) i just wanna share that ( i ) i feel pretty privileged to be hearing you talk about this because ( um ) it seems like you've been going through a lot in your life and to say that you care about your life and you want to save your life ( um ) and that that's what you're working towards is something that not everyone says and does
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.af	( uh ) it seems like you still have a fight in you and you have a lot to look forward to and you
client.fn	oh yeah
client.fn	there's still ( i ) i still haven't made it to alaska
counselor.af	that's right
client.fn	that was the whole purpose of coming here was to go to alaska
counselor.af	there you go
client.fn	[du] ( i ) i had a cataract for a year or so and i was always wanting to get it taken care of but i was too busy to get it taken care of
counselor.fa	uh-huh

client.fn	coming across ( i ) i had never been across the northern part of the united_states in a car
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	yeah

client.fn	and i thought well i'll take a bus so i took a bus across the dakotas and mon* and i got as far as montana ( and ) and ( i thought my contact ) i thought my contact had slipped or something i took my contact out and it wasn't just a contact started forming on my eye
counselor.su	ooh
client.fn	when i got to seattle i went to lowell's the bar at ( uh seattle or ) the marketplace and i thought west_seattle was clouds
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	that's how much my vision and ( by the ) by bumbershoot i couldn't read the numbers on a bus
counselor.su	oh wow

counselor.su	oh gosh
client.fn	and ( i didn't ) i started here to see about getting it fixed and i didn't get it fixed until ( uh ) march third before i got one of the cataracts removed
counselor.fa	huh
-	-
counselor.su	wow that's a long wait
client.fn	so
-	-
client.fn	i've been through nonsense
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know ) so again this is just something else i'm gonna deal with
counselor.su	yeah you have
-	-

counselor.gi	won't do that
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	so ( um ) chloe explained to you a little bit about what's gonna happen next
client.fn	yeah
counselor.st	okay so ( like ) what we'd like to do is sort of is continue the conversation ( um ) with you about some of the things that you'd ( um ) answered on ( the the ) the many different questionnaires that you did with her
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	( um if it's um ) if it's okay with you i'd like to ask you to just maybe talk with me a little bit about ( your ) your current drug use ( and ) and how that's going for you
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	or how it works or doesn't work
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah so that's it
counselor.quo	if you just wanna kinda let me know
-	-
client.o-4	well let me see where do i i don't use very much very often
client.fn	but apparently you're alarmed by it so
-	-
counselor.quc	all right ( what ) what's your drug of choice
-	-
client.fn	( um ) truthfully painkillers
client.r-4	well ( i ) i was in a automobile accident eight years ago and i'm not getting adequate pain control so
-	-
counselor.quc	so it was eight years ago
client.fn	yes
counselor.quc	and you're still in a lot of pain
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	and you have been for eight years all right
client.r-4	yes
-	-
counselor.rec	and your doctor's prescribing you painkillers
-	-
client.fn	no once in a while i'm able to get a hold of them
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quo	yeah tell me how you're able to get a hold of them
-	-
client.fn	oh my husband has dental work and he takes ( you know ) the painkillers prescribed to him but he doesn't take the other twelve or fifteen or whatever
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	or whomever i have a friend who's a cancer patient and once in a while she'll slide me a little bit of something
-	-
counselor.quc	all right are there other drugs that you use
-	-
client.o-1	mm i'm inclined to drink once in a while but not much and not often
client.fn	i had i've probably drank more in the last three weeks than i would most of the rest of the year
-	-
counselor.res	so really it's only alcohol and painkillers
-	-
client.r-1	well no it's just that my birthday was on the fourth so ( like ) one of my friends bought me a bottle of wine so we shared a bottle of wine
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	oh
client.o-1	in fact i still have some in the refrigerator so it's not that i drink a lot it's just in fact i really don't drink a lot
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+1	my dad was an alcoholic and i'd just as soon not follow ( uh uh ) in his footsteps
-	-
counselor.rec	so you're pretty clear about your limits on alcohol use
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	and it sounds like ( y* you ) you drink alcohol on occasion ( to ) to socialize and it's not that big of a deal
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	( um ) talk a little bit more about the painkillers
counselor.rec	it sounds like ( you ) you feel like you're not getting adequate pain
-	-
client.fn	( i think that ) i think my doctor too since i since my previous doctor moved away doctor two isn't prescribing narcotics
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+4	which might be a good thing
client.c-4	but i'm gonna get them legally or illegally so
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.o+4	and i wish she'd just prescribe ( like ) something that works it doesn't necessarily have to be a narcotic
client.o+4	( like ) and i'm seen at the pain clinic and that helps for short periods of time
-	-
counselor.quo	oh what helps about it
-	-
client.fn	( um ) well i've had procedures that actually ( they're ) they're trying to block all the pain receptors that are too ( it's ) it's not so much that i'm in pain but the pain receptors don't know how to turn themselves off
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( and ) and that's about ( as ) as clear as i can understand it so
-	-
client.fn	and i'd like we're trying to turn them off so [laugh]
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so ( you've ) you've tried other things and you currently are working ( on ) on doing ( uh ) it sounds like a variety of things to try to help ease some of this pain chronic pain that you're in and it's effective sometimes not all the time
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	it's ( wh* ) which is effective
-	-
counselor.gi	the stuff that you're working with ( um ) through the pain clinic
-	-
client.fn	it works for short periods
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	we're talking days not months
-	-
counselor.rec	okay and as far as you're concerned or ( e* ) what you would like is to have more relief of your pain and you would like ( to ) to get narcotics to help with that
-	-
client.fn	well not necessarily something that works
client.fn	if narcotics are the answer that'd be great if it's not that's fine too
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	and narcotics have been the only thing that other than this brief periods of relief the narcotics have only been the things to work
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and then ( like when they ) when i was prescribed them i was prescribed fifteen twenty milligrams at any given time and that's fine
counselor.fa	right
client.r-4	it's better than not having any
-	-
counselor.rec	so you're not it's not that you're wanting ( pain* ) narcotics in particular it's just that's what's really worked
-	-
client.r-4	that's the only thing i've found that worked yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	okay ( um ) can you describe that a little bit more about how it works
counselor.quo	or ( how how ) how is it more effective than ( any oth* ) anything else
-	-
client.fn	the pain clinic works for weeks or months at a time and then eventually it wears off
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-4	and it just ( i ) i mean i have been in so much pain i've cracked teeth clenching my teeth so hard
counselor.su	wow
-	-
counselor.su	that sounds like a lot of pain
-	-
client.fn	so ( that's why ) and that's why ( the other thing ) the other logical answer would be chiropractic care but that's just not an option
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	( um ) that's the only thing that's ever really worked
-	-
counselor.quo	tell me ( about how ) about how the narcotics work in what ways do they work
client.fn	well
-	-
client.r-4	( i can i ) i can either sleep better or function better depending on what i'm doing
client.fn	usually i will take ( you know half of whatever ) half of whatever ( pi* ) pill or cap that i have and at a time and then i'll take one once a week or two or
client.r-4	( um ) but i'll take them ( like ) when i'm in too much pain to ( like ) lately i've been stumbling and falling and i'm not drunk i'm just i have
-	-
client.fn	i think i have lupus personally but the doctor doesn't see it that way which and she could well be right i don't have enough information on it to make ( you know ) an educated guess
client.r-4	but ( um ) and just i had been in pain for so long and i'm tired of it
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	so
counselor.res	sounds like you've had ( you know m* m* ) many years of being in pain without much relief
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	well
-	-
client.fn	i mean have you lived in seattle long
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) about ten years or so
client.fn	oh okay
-	-
client.fn	so it made the news the accident made the news here
counselor.fa	hmm
client.fn	it was outside of yakima but it made the news here because they interviewed us
-	-
client.fn	that's how bad it was
counselor.rec	yeah pretty serious accident
-	-
client.fn	now by all rights we should have all been killed we got my daughter got a scratch on her hand
-	-
counselor.rec	wow so you're pretty fortunate to have survived
client.fn	i don't think so
counselor.rec	oh yeah so the misfortune was that now you have to live with this chronic pain
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm exactly
-	-
client.r-4	and it's not going away and it's not changing very much and it's not being resolved
-	-
counselor.res	so you said that using narcotics helps you sleep better ( you ) it sounds like you use it for breakthrough pain
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	what else what else is what else makes it better
client.r-4	the problem is everything
-	-
client.r-4	is breakthrough pain these days
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i mean there's a certain nerve like i have to sit cross_legged because if i don't i put pressure on my there's a certain set of nerves in my leg i'll pass out
-	-
counselor.quo	but what else ( how el* ) how else ( is ) is are the narcotics better than anything else
-	-
client.r-4	well they're effective they're more effective than anything else
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+4	but if they find something that worked that wasn't narcotic i'd be happy to try it
-	-
counselor.res	and you're gonna get them i think as you said legally or illegally just because that's what's effective
client.fn	exactly
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	( pro* ) so tell me a little bit about what are some perhaps negative ( um ) or some ( you know ) risks associated ( with ) with narcotics
client.fn	well
counselor.res	( w* ) we already talked about one being illegal ( it could ) it could potentially it's illegal
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.o-4	well i'm actually i have given people drugs that i have been that i'm was no longer taking
client.fn	( um ) and in fact ( one uh ) once it was a police officer
client.fn	my great_grandmother died and my aunt didn't have time to get her medicine she was in albuquerque and lives in denver
client.fn	and i happened to be just finished taking a certain course of drugs and i had the same drugs she was needing
-	-
client.fn	so and it was like that was fine
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and that's ( um ) but that's unusual to do that
-	-
counselor.res	yeah to give somebody else your prescription
client.fn	well
-	-
client.fn	it's unusual for anyone to give them to me although it happens
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( um ) and it's unusual that i end up needing or having what somebody else needs
client.fn	i mean i even had the same dose that she needed so
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
counselor.quc	( are ) are you concerned at all about any aspects of taking painkillers
counselor.quc	does that concern you at all
client.o-4	not
-	-
client.o-4	as much as i take them and as sparingly as i take them
-	-
counselor.res	okay you don't take them that much
-	-
client.o-4	( very ) well i wouldn't say not very rarely but rarely ( um )
-	-
counselor.quc	but ( you know ) is that because you that's all you can get
client.r+4	i don't have access to them
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	all right so you would take them more if you had them
client.o-4	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	so ( let's just say ) let's hypothetically say if you had them if you had unlimited access can you think of anything that you would be then concerned about in terms of taking those
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.o-4	no
client.o-4	because i wouldn't
-	-
client.o-4	take them more than i needed
-	-
counselor.quo	so you would ( you ) what are some risks that you know of that would ( you ) that you're thinking of that would motivate you to take them as prescribed
-	-
client.o-4	if i had adequate oh if i took them as prescribed i'm not ( ta* ) i mean i would take such low doses that addiction wouldn't be a concern
-	-
counselor.rec	so though you are aware of the potential for addiction as a concern
client.fn	yes
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.o-4	but i mean all things in moderation so
-	-
counselor.res	so you're pretty comfortable with knowing that you would be able to manage taking painkillers as they're prescribed then addiction wouldn't be an issue for you okay all right
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	no
-	-
client.fn	my dad was an alcoholic and i just don't
client.o-1	in fact i rarely even drink so
-	-
counselor.quc	do you have any other things that you're ( conc* ) kinda concerned about in terms of drug use
-	-
client.o-4	no i'm not sharing needles i'm not using drugs requiring needles so
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
counselor.res	( your ) it sounds like your main concern is that you're not getting adequate narcotics ( to ease ) to help ease your pain
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	yeah tell me how that discussion has gone with your doctor
-	-
client.r-n4	( um ) well for a long time i just didn't want to take narcotics but it's gotten to a point where i need something
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so ( sh* ) the problem is the pain specialist ( wants doctor ) wants my primary care doctor to prescribe them and ( doctor ) my primary care doctor isn't prescribing anything so well she's prescribing ( like ) neurontin ( um )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	so your pain doctor ( is ) is actually ( r* su* or ) recommending that you get more pain medication
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	yeah okay but your primary care doctor's has ( ref* ) refused to prescribe that for anybody
client.fn	has
-	-
client.fn	( not ) has not done it any way ( she hasn't ) she hasn't said i refuse to
counselor.fa	all right
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( and ) and that might be the responsible thing to do
client.r-4	but if she had my kinda pain she would see that
counselor.quo	what do you
-	-
counselor.quo	( wh* ) where do you think ( uh ) everyone's reluctance to prescribe this kind of medication comes from
-	-
client.o-4	i don't know i wouldn't ask for very high doses
-	-
counselor.quo	yeah what do you think she's concerned about
-	-
client.r+4	i don't know because i mean if she thinks i'm gonna start abusing them that's a valid concern
client.o-4	but when she sees that i'm going to be filling it ( once a ) once a month or whatever the
-	-
counselor.rec	using it responsibly
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah all right
-	-
client.fn	where if she really thinks i would have an addiction issue she can prescribe ten at a time
client.o-4	( and ) and i wouldn't take them as often as appropriate anyways because i don't generally
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	so just to review a little bit ( you ) you're trying different types ( of ) of ( uh ) treatments to reduce your pain some of which are effective some are not ( uh ) but really the most effective has been ( the the ) the painkillers helps [cough]
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	well the most effective
-	-
client.fn	has been chiropractic but that just isn't ( available ) available to me now
-	-
counselor.res	so ( chiro* ) the chiropractor has been even more effective than the painkillers
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	so why is that not available to you
client.fn	because
-	-
client.fn	i can't afford it
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and disability doesn't cover it
-	-
counselor.rec	it's not covered through your insurance
client.fn	no
counselor.quo	i wonder if your doctor was able to prescribe it or something
-	-
client.fn	( um ) good question
-	-
counselor.gi	certainly i bet that if she ( you know ) knew that that was even more effective than pain medication that would be more interesting to her probably yeah
client.fn	in fact she's of
-	-
client.fn	asian descent so i'm assuming that she's probably aware of that
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.rec	yup so just in terms of talking about the pain medication then it does help you sleep better helps with breakthrough pain it's been more effective than anything that you have available to you right now ( um ) at the other hand it's illegal ( so ) and so you're taking a legal risk by taking other people's medication
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	( um but you're ) and you're aware that there's potential for addiction but ( you're ) you're really not worried about that
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	okay ( and it's ) and it's just your doctor's been reluctant to prescribe them so ( that's a ) that's been a problem
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	okay so what do you think what do you think you might do considering all of those things
client.fn	well
-	-
client.o-4	take what i can when i can and it's not [du]
-	-
counselor.res	( kinda keep you know ) kinda keep going doing
client.fn	keep busy
-	-
client.fn	and try to stay as busy as i can until then
-	-
counselor.st	all right ( um ) part of ( this ) this ( um ) conversation we had is ( to um ) to show you a score that you got on what's called a drug_abuse_screening_test
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	and that was part of the questionnaires that you did
counselor.gi	and what i'd like to do is ask you ( this ) this drug_abuse_screening_test is scaled ( um on um ) from ( uh uh ) zero to ten with zero being no risk and ten being severe risk
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) and in the middle there is some risk and moderate risk
counselor.quc	and i just wondered what you thought how much does your drug use your current drug use how much risk does it expose you to
counselor.gi	and by risk
client.o-4	not much
counselor.res	not much
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	would you say no risk some risk moderate risk or severe risk
client.fn	some risk
-	-
counselor.gi	okay well it turns out ( that ) that the way you've scored that there's some risk ( uh ) as well
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	( uh which doesn't mean ) which doesn't mean that there's no risk it means there is some risk
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	and we talked about what those risks might be ( um )
-	-
client.fn	so when did you score this
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.gi	i didn't do this this is what chloe gave to me
client.fn	oh okay
counselor.res	yeah ( um ) and we talked about those risks being legal and some of those risks being addiction
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	well i'm not gonna go outside the home to find it ( um )
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	so you're doing some things to reduce that risk
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	not
-	-
client.o-4	asking police officers ( for ) for [du] stupidly
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quc	[laugh] all right well ( uh ) do you have any questions about anything that we talked about
client.fn	no
counselor.af	i appreciate you taking the time to do this
counselor.rec	( um ) i know ( um ) [nvv] it sounds like you have your ( th* ) this is clearly something that's important for you you've been dealing with it for a long time you've explored some different options that ( have been more ) have been effective
client.fn	mm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	( um ) and it sounds like you're gonna continue to do that ( um ) but also continue to do ( what ) what you need to do then to ( release your release relief ) relieve [laugh] your pain
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	relieve
client.fn	[du]
counselor.gi	yeah all right so ( um ) i don't really have anything else to ( um )
client.fn	okay

client.fn	( um ) i've gotten it down to one a day
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-a7	but ( uh ) being homeless on the street it's hard to kick
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+a7	( you know ) and i've done it before when i've had a home
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+7	( you know ) but i just need a place ( to ) to be able to ( get ) get rid of this
-	-
client.fn	and my counselor at sound_mental_health is on top of it he knows what i'm going through and might even put me in detox
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	okay
client.o-1	okay ( if uh um ) [du] i have one beer in the morning and that's it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	alright
client.fn	( i don't know if you i ) i had a beer this morning at seven o'clock i don't know if you can smell it now or not
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( uh )
client.fn	but i know
counselor.quc	so when did you last take some benzos
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) this morning
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-7	okay i'm taking benzos on a daily basis ( uh ) because i basically wake up sick
counselor.fa	alright
client.fn	okay but i don't take the benzo until after i've dosed and ( uh ) i wait for the ( the uh ) methadone to kick in so i get the full effect of it
counselor.gi	so
client.fn	( you know ) i don't wake up and take a benzo
-	-
counselor.quc	( so the methadone ) so does this help the methadone last longer for you or
client.fn	it
-	-
client.fn	it helps ( uh ) the ( uh ) benzo stay in my system longer without getting sick and having to use more than one a day
-	-
counselor.res	after the methadone is kicked in
client.fn	right
client.fn	kicked in
client.fn	i give it a half hour and then i take ( uh ) one benzo
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( um ) if i were to go by the time of bedtime i wouldn't be able to sleep
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-7	( um ) i've kicked it before and it's very very uncomfortable ( it ) [nvv] you have what's called a rebound
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.r-7	( you know ) you take benzos to ( um you know ) take the stress out
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-7	but ( it ) when you quit it's multiplied in reverse
client.r-a7	( you know uh ) and it's very difficult and ( um ) i don't know if i can taper myself off or not
client.c+7	if i can't within ( i ) i made a promise to my counselor if i can't get rid of the benzos and the beer in a month i will go to detox and then after that possibly treatment
-	-
counselor.quc	okay so how much beer do you take in the morning
client.fn	one twenty_four ounce can
counselor.res	so one twenty_four ounce can
client.fn	and it's not ( uh ) two_eleven or anything it's bud_ice
-	-
counselor.res	and then you go get your methadone
-	-
client.fn	no no i ( drink the ) get the methadone first
-	-
counselor.res	oh the methadone comes first
client.fn	because ( uh )
client.fn	because i don't want them to smell the alcohol
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	okay and then i walk over and get the beer have a few sips of beer
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	after a half hour i take the benzo
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so ( y* ) it's kind of a cocktail in
client.fn	okay
-	-
client.o+7	right but it's getting out of hand where i'm taking three medications ( uh ) to maintain ( uh ) without getting sick
client.fn	see i've got a ( uh ) i don't know one beer a day
client.r+a1	see i think i could kick ( uh ) the alcohol part of it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-1	( you know ) but i'm homeless
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) i've got a beautiful apartment that's section eight
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) i've already placed a five_hundred dollar deposit the landlord has already taken ( uh ) the ( uh uh ) ads out of the paper
client.fn	( uh s* ) this particular section eight is hooked up with sound_mental_health they'll pay two_thirds of the rent plus the deposit
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( i ) i just gave mick ( uh ) five_hundred dollars yesterday and that will be applied to my rent ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and my rent will be three_hundred a month
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	so i gave him five_hundred dollars so the first month's rent will be taken care of and then ( uh ) i'll just have to come up with a_hundred dollars the second rent
counselor.gi	so
counselor.st	let's talk some more about the drug and alcohol ( and your ) and your methadone
counselor.quc	so how long have you been on the methadone
-	-
client.fn	january of two_thousand and i have not had a needle in my arm since
client.fn	( i ) i had a great job ( uh ) but ( uh ) for eight months i went to a_a and cold turkey and white knuckled it
client.fn	and ( um ) i had a physician here or at the harborview offer ( to take ) to get me on methadone the next day in federal_way because it was really affecting ( uh ) my work
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and for five years i had this job and no one knew i was on methadone it worked excellent for me
counselor.af	good
client.fn	i didn't ( uh ) use any cocaine alcohol nothing and i was very excited
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	( uh ) but the building was sold and it was completely remodeled and they didn't need me and so i lost my job
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	okay ( um ) i had ( uh ) a month left on my apartment and then i had to come i've been homeless before here so when i lost my job in tacoma which i loved ( uh ) i had to come back down here
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) still on methadone but i couldn't pay for it so i had to get a voucher
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	( um ) i had a warrant ( uh ) in seattle and they arrested me in tacoma took me ( to r* ) to r_j_c where they had a program where i could get a one year voucher for methadone
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and they kept that in my property and so when i left i had this voucher for methadone
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and so there was a three or four week period where i was ( using uh ) smoking ( uh ) heroin until i could get on the methadone program
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and so ever since then i got hooked up with ( uh ) g_a_s
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	okay i finally got my decision january sixth for s_s_i ( um ) the doctor was there for the state my lawyer the judge and i and she just reamed the doctor out okay
-	-
counselor.st	okay so i wanna talk a little bit more
counselor.gi	( i'm s* ) i apologize for stopping you
client.fn	that's fine that's fine
counselor.st	what i really wanna try and keep us focused on a little bit here is more what's going on when you take your methadone
counselor.res	so it sounds like from what you've just told me that you started methadone in two_thousand
counselor.quc	when did you add the benzos
-	-
client.r-7	( when uh ) after about four years it's just been within the last six or seven months ( it's where ) i've been living in a shelter for five years and the stress was killing me
client.fn	( uh ) ( i ) ( i ) i was trying for ( uh ) subsidized housing
counselor.gi	s*
counselor.quc	uh-huh okay so ( for ) after four and a half years you just all of a sudden started using the benzos
client.fn	and
client.fn	well i played with it [du]
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-7	for stress
counselor.quo	tell me
counselor.quo	about that
-	-
client.r-7	well i was stressed out that i was looking at three more years of being in a shelter before subsidized housing was coming through i'd filled out all the paperwork and just it was getting further and further away
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	mm had you had some sort of benzos before in part of your treatment
client.fn	no i didn't even know
client.fn	i had no idea what they were about
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	except i was told that it because i was really stressed out and someone there at the clinic that i knew says 'try one of these'
client.r-7	and ( it was the ) it was a panacea ( uh ) that i was looking for
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+7	okay not knowing or being told that there would be ( uh you know ) repercussions a habit
-	-
counselor.quc	alright alright so are there any
counselor.quc	( tell me ) you ( s* ) told me that when you talk with your case manager that you talked a little bit about wanting to get off of the benzos
client.r+d1	no just the alcohol
-	-
counselor.res	just the alcohol
client.fn	right
counselor.quc	alright and have they talked
counselor.quc	so ( when you ) if you were to go to detox ( what is ) that's just a detox off your alcohol
client.fn	well what we're waiting for
client.r+1	[nvv] right ( i could de* ) i could detox both my alcohol and my benzos at my apartment because i have a place to watch t_v curl up and be miserable
counselor.res	so ( you're not ) you're not
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	( uh ) these vouchers they're giving me for food i get twelve dollars in food stamps now
client.r+a7	this will help me be able to isolate myself and kick it i've done it before
-	-
counselor.rec	okay but i'm kinda hearing from you ( that you ) that you really don't wanna detox off the benzos as
counselor.rec	much as
client.r+d1	yes i do i want to completely detox off the alcohol and the benzos
counselor.res	you do
counselor.fa	oh
client.r-7	i was using them to self-medicate my homelessness
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	because i've been ( uh ) i applied for s_s_i in january of oh_four and i have a fifty_eight_thousand dollar back payment they're holding for me ( uh ) my payee
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and that's my nest egg that's the only money i'll ever see in my life again ( that ) that size and i'm very protective of it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	sound_mental_health is my payee i've been going with them for four years i trust them implicitly with that money ( you know )
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	there's other people i've ( heard ) heard horror stories
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so i'm very happy with them holding it and i'm not interested in the interest i'm not all wound up and that kinda stuff i want them to hold onto it
client.fn	what they'll give me ( is ) once i move in is money for a t_v and a vacuum and a microwave
-	-
client.fn	i have hooked up with the fellow that does the a_a will take me to ( a um uh ) i don't know what they call it it's the furniture warehouse that you get donated furniture
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like you're very motivated right now ( to to get ) to get off of ( the ) all of this
client.o+7	very focused very motivated
client.r+7	all of this because i'm a different person when i'm not drinking and benzoing
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	and so as soon as you get into the apartment this is what you're going to do
client.c+7	that's correct
-	-
counselor.res	okay and ( if you don't ) if you're not able to curl up on the couch and do it yourself
client.fn	now
-	-
client.c+7	i'm gonna go to detox
counselor.af	okay well that sounds like a good plan
client.fn	okay
client.fn	what
client.c+1	what ( uh ) my plan is is maybe have a half a can of beer or buy a small can of beer for a couple of days and then ( uh you know ) go off completely
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( uh ) benzos i'll do a five day detox on them ( you know )
counselor.quo	and how will you do that
-	-
client.fn	just ( uh ) taking one milligram instead of two
-	-
counselor.quc	okay and do you get any benzos from your psychiatrist at some point
client.fn	no i have
client.fn	no psychiatrist
-	-
counselor.res	so you just are getting it through

counselor.fa	right
client.r+a7	but i can do it
-	-

client.fn	i have a sponsor but he really doesn't know where i'm at because he would demand immediate and i can't give it to him i'm homeless okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and maybe that's just a crutch or an excuse
client.r-a7	but it's very difficult to ( uh ) withdraw from drugs living on the streets

client.r+d3	when you get scared and not be [du] ( you know ) that's when it stops being fun to me you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right

counselor.rec	but it sounds like you're able to stop without dwelling on the good things that you liked about it
-	-
client.r+a3	yeah ( i ) i am ( you know )
client.fn	[du]
counselor.gi	which can lead people to slip back and try it again
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah but ( i you know like ) a lot of people say go to a_a go to c_a talking about cocaine is gonna make me want to use it
counselor.fa	ahh
client.fn	( i don't ) i don't like going to the meetings and all that because everybody talking [du] and they all say we're not glorifying but they really are you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	hmm
-	-
client.r-3	i mean if you're ( talking about it ) trying to leave it alone but you're talking about it every day that'll even make me want to try it one more time maybe i'll get some different results this time knowing that i won't but ( i'm thinking you know ) the addict in you is thinking maybe it'll be a little funner this time it wasn't fun yesterday it might be [du] today you see what i'm saying
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.res	[du]

client.fn	yeah
client.r+3	yeah they're not real yeah they're not real it's delusional
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.af	wow
counselor.res	so you said earlier that ( you can be you know ) you went from ninety_two to ninety_eight or ninety_six whatever it was clean and then woke up one day and kinda thought back when you got high
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah my wife was kind of tripping too because i woke up that morning and she must have ( you know ) knowing me ( like ) we've been together off and on since we was kids sixteen seventeen so she kinda knows
client.fn	she said what you thinking about ( i said ) she said wendell don't i said what you talking about she said i see you got that look i see what you [du] she said you try and you go do what you wanna do go get high
-	-
client.fn	and she had been clean ( like ) seven years at that time and then when i relapsed she relapsed and so ( you know ) it was kinda like a chain reaction ( you know ) and
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.quo	what do you think was the [du]
-	-
client.r-3	like i told you ( i i you know ) i just had a flashback a memory from the last time i got high which was like i said six years ago and i kinda had fun that day and i said well i wonder if i can have fun today
client.fn	( you know ) and i had a bunch of money ( you know ) and i said well i'm gonna go buy me ( s* you know ) everything that i need and that's what i did
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i stayed on relapse mode from two_oh_seven no from two_oh_four to two_oh_seven a three year run a mean one you know what i'm saying all the way to the penitentiary you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	hmm
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	i'm just coming home from the penitentiary i've been gone three years so
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and then now ( this is ) this is the cold one and i'm gone from all this oh_seven to july ten so i haven't been home quite two months yet it would be two months this month on the twenty_second
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( um ) i had to report for sixty days so ( you know ) when i first go down there i gotta give a u_a
-	-
client.fn	and ( uh d* d* ) two days before i go report i decided to get high ( you know ) that's the cold thing because i knew i had to go report i knew i had to
client.fn	[du]
counselor.res	so you knew that was coming up
-	-
client.fn	yeah and i got high so when i go down there my c_c_o asked me he said ( uh ) well you been getting high i said yeah my u_a is dirty he said why did you do that i said i felt like getting high ( you know ) he said well you knew you had to come see
client.r-3	i said well ( you know ) consequences sometime don't outweigh [nvv] whatever i said [du] sometime the consequences don't outweigh what you wanna do or how you [du] on drugs [du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but he was cool
counselor.quo	so what do
counselor.quo	you get from it
-	-
client.fn	what's that
-	-
counselor.gi	using
-	-
client.r-3	from getting high ( uh ) when i get high on cocaine to me and i tell people this and they laugh ( i uh ) i get to act out how i wanna say it i get to be different and i can justify me acting different by being on a different on ( you know you know ) when you aren't [du]
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.quo	different how
client.r-3	i don't know how you feel [du] smoked crack cocaine but if you have you know it puts you in a whole different state of mind
client.r-3	so i get to act out i need to run around ( i get to be ) i can act paranoid i can think i see shit hear shit
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.quo	( i mean ) do you like that
-	-
client.r-d3	sometime
client.r+d3	and sometime not
client.r-3	just depend on sometime it could be a good trip
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	sometime it can be a bad trip
counselor.fa	right
client.r-3	( you know ) when it's a good trip it's a good thing
counselor.res	but there's something
client.r+3	but when it's a bad one it's a real bad thing
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	so ( you know )
counselor.fa	sure
-	-
counselor.rec	but there's something that you're looking for it sounds like because you said i get to act out in a way that i don't normally
-	-
client.fn	yeah i mean because i'm normally like when you see me now ( you know ) i'm a calm cool collected type of person
counselor.quo	what do you want to do
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right
client.r-3	and then when i get high under the influence ( i ) i can grab my pistol if i want to and i can think that somebody is behind [du] get ready to knock it down with a hammer or a batter ram or i can [du] around it knowing that they don't but who knows they might you feel me [laugh]
-	-
counselor.gi	so i wanna make sure i understand because ( i ) i understand all that but ( i i'm ) i feel like i'm missing a piece ( in ) in getting you
client.fn	okay
counselor.res	so i understand that the drug changes your brain and how you see things and you get paranoid and see things that aren't there sometimes and that stuff i get
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	but you're saying it's almost like i wanna be able to act differently than i do in my normal life
client.fn	[du]
counselor.quo	and i'm wondering what is it you're trying to ( what ) what do you [du] to act different
client.fn	i don't know if i s*
client.fn	i don't know if i said that right
client.r-3	but my thing is sometime i don't wanna be calm and cool and collected
counselor.gi	that's the piece i'm trying to understand
counselor.quo	what do you want to be
client.fn	( sometime i )
client.fn	sometime ( i ) i like to be ( you know ) how i ( like ) when i'm normal when i get high i'll pretend that i'm normal knowing that i really ain't feel me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) so ( it's it's ) it's kinda hard to really explain
counselor.quo	so what do you
counselor.su	yeah i know
client.fn	i'm not a psychiatrist or sociologist or nothing [du]
counselor.gi	you don't need to be
-	-
counselor.gi	you're talking about you and your experience
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	but ( it's it's ) it's different
client.fn	and some people i can get high but most of the time i get high by myself my woman i can get high but her
client.fn	i really can't get high around people because i don't trust them when i'm high and then i get [du] i get paranoid and think they might be trying to rob me something [du] [du] gonna tell them everybody gotta get out of here right now see you later
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	you know what i'm [laugh] saying so ( you know ) and my girl she knows how i be so if we have company and we get ready to get high she'll tell them no don't huh-uh
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.res	go
client.fn	she say [du] you guys better go because he ain't nothing nice when he gets high ( when it's like ) if it ain't just me and her if it's her and me it's cool but me and other people
counselor.nc	[du]
-	-
counselor.rec	( you know ) what i hear is this real mix for you kinda like you're pulled in two different directions there's this part of you that doesn't like the hassle and the hustle and doesn't like the paranoia and the weird feelings and things that go on
client.fn	ki* ya*
client.fn	but it
client.fn	make you wonder why i keep doing it
-	-
counselor.rec	well but on the other hand there's a part of you that feels like it sounds like you need to kinda get out of your normal quote-unquote mode you wanna feel i don't know if it's freer or more excited or something that you're wanting that's different than your normal life and yet you don't like it when you get there and so you're kind of ( in this ) between a rock and a hard place sometimes
client.fn	yeah [du]
counselor.rec	there's a part of you that wants the normal life and the other part of you is wanting to ( be ) be able to be different and how you i'm not quite sure what the different is that you're wanting but how you've gotten that is through the cocaine
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	[du]
counselor.quc	and i'm just wondering have you ever thought about being able to be whatever that different is freer more [du] without the cocaine
-	-
client.fn	yeah when i'm not under the ( in* ) i'm a real nice person non-violent all the way
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-3	cocaine don't make me violent it just ( bring ) it might bring out violent traits
client.o-3	and you might think that i'm a violent person just by the way i [du] maybe i'll say i'm more aggressive when i'm under the influence of cocaine but i don't have ( a ) one violent thing on my record in my whole life so
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i'm more scared of you than you are of me when i'm high on cocaine
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know ) so i'll be trying to get away from you if i got high around you or anybody other than my woman i'll be saying i'll see you guys later if i'm at your house if you're at my house you gotta go you hear what i'm saying so that's just how it is
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	so other than this different feeling that ( we're ) we had a little trouble pinning down what else do you get out of getting high
counselor.quo	what else are the benefits what are the good things for you of getting high
-	-
client.fn	i haven't really thought about it like that
counselor.fa	mm
client.r-3	other than just getting away from myself for a little while ( you know )
counselor.fa	hmm
counselor.quo	why do you need to get away from
counselor.quo	you
client.r-3	i don't know ( just you know ) just being different ( you know ) i like being different a lot i like to be by myself a lot ( you know )
client.r-3	so i like to do things ( you know ) where ( i'm not bo* ) i'm not bothering you i'm not a burden to you i'm not [du] i get my own money i do my own thing i take care of me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-3	i'm looking for nobody to do nothing for me that's the worst thing you could do if you're on narcotics is be dependent on other people for you to get high you know what i'm saying i won't do that
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.rec	so ( there's a real ) you have a real sense of responsibility and self care
-	-
client.fn	yeah i make sure
client.fn	i [du]
counselor.quc	do you ever feel like you can get away from people without getting high
-	-
client.fn	yeah of course i mean i've done it for years from birth to fifty_two years old i think i've done just about everything a ninety year old person might [du] life ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.res	uh-huh you've got a lot of experience
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	( you know ) good ones and bad ones ( you know )
-	-
counselor.af	so i'm kinda ( s* ) fascinated
counselor.res	you said you'd never really thought about kinda what are the good things and the bad things
client.r+3	( i ) i never because i don't think there's any good thing about getting high
client.r-3	but in your mind you think there is so i kinda think it's ( a dis* ) what you call a disillusion ( or ) or whatever i'm saying i'm [du] if i'm saying it right but you think though that it is
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+3	i don't think there's anything good about spending your money and all your money your last money and you hustling to get this money and you really need this money and you turn it around and give it away like you don't like money or something so that's the bad part that's the flip side
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.rec	so wendell what i'm hearing is i work hard to get my money and then to turn around and just blow it on blow doesn't make sense i don't like the paranoia that comes with it ( um ) i don't like that kinda sense i don't wanna be around people i don't see any in your own words you said i don't see any benefits of using
client.fn	yeah
client.r+3	it doesn't
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	so why do you use
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know ) so [du] next time i see you maybe i'll have my answer for you right now my mind ain't thinking because i could say a whole bunch of things but if i say something i wanna make sure that's the right thing ( you know ) ( you know )
counselor.fa	hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	sure
counselor.fa	sure
-	-
counselor.nc	[du]
client.o+3	i know today that i won't use
client.o-3	i don't know what tomorrow might bring
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+3	but today i'm kinda cooling off [laugh] ( you know )
client.ts-3	i had a wild one yesterday so kinda
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.rec	oh mellowing out a little today
client.fn	uh
-	-
counselor.rec	mellowing out a little today
client.r+3	yes yes yeah yeah i had a wild one yesterday it wasn't a very good one wasn't a good experience and so when i tend to have bad episodes when i get high i kinda tend to stay away from getting high until i can figure it out in my mind
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	sure
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	is today a good day to try this one again maybe i'll get better results or maybe i'd better just leave it all the way alone and go into my clean and sober mode for a little while
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	so ( you know ) i don't care about labels
counselor.res	you described yourself as a functioning addict
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	( um ) what do you what's your plan
client.o-3	very functional
counselor.res	you talked about you think you're kind of heading toward a clean and sober phase
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	( is there ) do you have a plan about when that's gonna happen or how that's gonna happen
client.fn	my plan [du] do that
client.r+3	is because there's a lot of things that i need to do excuse me that i want to do
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	there's a lot of things first of all that i need to do for me and then there's some things that i wanna do for people that i care about and love which is my kids and my grandkids and i know it isn't always amusing spending [du] dope
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	can't do that
client.r+a3	can't do it
-	-
counselor.res	okay so that's a real
client.fn	so
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.r+n3	that's a block right there bam it's gotta stop ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.rec	( so that's ) but it's also a real vision and goal that you have to work for if i want to be there for those people and help them out and do [du]
client.fn	yeah
client.r+3	my kids
client.r+3	my kids know i'm used to having a bunch of money so when they call me and say dad i need a hundred dollars or dad your grandson lost his ( cell ) blackberry or blueberry whatever they call them things he need another one and they know and if i say i don't have the money right [du] they know i'm back under the influence of narcotics that's not a very good feeling for your kids to know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.res	so you don't like that they
client.fn	well they know what i do
counselor.fa	right
client.r+3	but they don't like me being [du]
client.fn	i don't lie to them if they ask me dad are you getting high yeah ( you know ) why [du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	[du]
counselor.quo	what's that like for you ( s* ) admit to them that you've been
client.fn	well i got
-	-
client.fn	me and my kids always been close and ( you know ) always had a open understanding and ( we ) we talk about everything
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so we know and their mother used to be an addict prostitute and everything else and i used to be this and that and so ( you know ) there ain't no secrets in our family so ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	sure
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r-3	and some of my kids can accept
client.r+3	and then some of them can't
counselor.fa	ahh
client.r+3	( you know ) ( some i i ) a couple of them it's real verbal and ( real you know ) real vocal about how they feel about ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	and you sell a bunch of dope ( and and and so you ) and you take e_p_o that's cocaine and heroin and that so you ain't got no business talking about ( you know ) and being judgmental

counselor.fa	right

counselor.fa	right
client.o-3	the only difference between me and them is they're in denial about what they do and i ain't never been in denial for what i do ( you know )
counselor.fa	sure
client.fn	and then ( if ) if my thing is if you're ashamed of what you're doing stop doing it
counselor.fa	sure
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	and if i felt ashamed of what when i stopped getting high it ain't because i'm ashamed of getting high i'm just tired of getting high ( you know )

client.fn	[du] it's just answering the questions honestly and trying to get some help for yourself
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+3	well for me anyway
-	-
counselor.res	mm-hmm so you're kinda looking at yourself ( trying to get ) trying to get some help
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm because i have behavioral problems more ( uh uh ) [du] i think my thing is more behavioral than it is
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	[du] i know what i'm trying to say but i'm not saying it right
-	-
counselor.rec	( that ) you're trying to say you feel like maybe you're not addicted it's ( like ) the circumstances and stuff like th*
-	-
client.o+3	no i am addicted
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	[du] but ( i ) i think i change [du] ( uh )
-	-
counselor.rec	do the same things over and over
client.fn	over and over
client.r+3	yeah when i know that they're not no good for me so that's
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.rec	( like ) if you could change those patterns something like that okay
client.fn	my prob*
client.fn	yeah
client.o+3	yeah yeah
client.fn	[laugh] yeah [laugh]
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	well ( um like ) like megan said i'm alex and ( this part of the ) this part of the interview is a little bit different
client.fn	uh-huh
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.res	( um ) because i know she's been asking a lot of questions like you said
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.st	and here we just kinda wanna give you a chance to talk a little bit more about drug use and i'll kinda just be following along with you
counselor.rec	and ( um ) it sounds like you've been thinking about change
counselor.gi	that's definitely not ( uh you know ) and that topic might come up but ( this isn't really a um ) this isn't really a situation where i'm trying to force you change one way or another or anything like
client.fn	right
client.fn	right
counselor.ec	that i'm really just trying to hear your ideas about kinda what you want ( um ) to happen with your drug use and stuff like that ( you know )
counselor.gi	because some people come in they don't wanna change anything some people come in they wanna do complete ( you know ) one_eighty
counselor.ec	so that's up to you you're in the driver's seat
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.st	okay and it usually takes about fifteen to twenty_five minutes ( um ) and ( uh ) let's see there's anything else that we should mention
-	-
counselor.gi	they also give us this sheet here ( that ) to share with you and this is based on some of the answers that you gave us
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	and this is risk factors based on ( um ) drug use and you scored an eight which is up here ( in the ) in the severe risk
client.nc	[laugh]
client.o+3	( w* ) yeah oh yeah it's pretty severe it's not a question about that
client.fn	that's why i [du]
-	-
counselor.quc	mm-hmm can you tell me about that
counselor.quo	( like what's ) what's severe about it
-	-
client.fn	( i been ) i been using some kind of substance for the last forty_some odd years
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-3	and ( uh you know it's just ) like i said it's just ( a ) a behavioral thing ( i just ) more like just going through the motions not something that i seek out to do kinda thing
counselor.fa	okay yeah
counselor.res	so
client.r+3	and ( uh ) i'm getting older [laugh] and physically i'm not well either ( so i just ) and i haven't been for a long time
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+3	and ( if i ) if i can get ( s* ) some kind of help so i can change my pattern my thoughts the behavioral part of it ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	so it seems like ( there's there's ) now that you're getting older there's a connection between drug use and your health
client.fn	uh-huh
counselor.quc	and we're talking mostly cocaine right
client.fn	uh-huh
counselor.rec	okay so you see a connection between the two
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+3	and [du] and has been i'm not just sayin it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+a3	i'm just tired i can't i'm tired
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	it's taken a toll on me mentally
client.r+3	and it's [du] i don't want ( uh ) using ( and ) and going out there in the streets to be the reason that i
client.fn	well ( i ) he's not gonna take me until he's ready to go anyway [du]
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+3	but ( i don't ) i don't want that to be
-	-
counselor.rec	maybe the scene where you go
-	-
client.r+3	yeah [laugh] yeah ( you know ) oh god [du] me somewhere and ( uh ) you know
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+3	because i know better i have known better
client.fn	so that's where i'm at with you today
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	it sounds like there's something about what you're thinking about where ( it's ) it's definitely there's a better place than where you're yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.r+3	what i'm doing yeah
counselor.quc	can you tell me more about kinda that pattern or ( like how ) how it fits into your everyday life like
-	-
client.fn	well ( uh i just re* ) i relapsed about six months ago ( and uh ) after almost three years
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+d3	and ( uh i i ) i'm seeing old behaviors that i don't like
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	and i know for me what my things that i will do or have done and i'm heading that way if i don't stop now
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	so
-	-
counselor.rec	so based on some of your doing some of the old behaviors now you kinda see that maybe spiraling out of control
client.fn	yeah
client.o+3	i see
-	-
client.o+3	right right
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+3	if i don't yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	this ain't your first rodeo
-	-
client.r+3	no [laugh] no and it should have been my last years ago
counselor.fa	ahh
client.fn	but i shoulda coulda woulda
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+3	yeah but i can see that ( i i ) i know me and i know if i continue to keep going the way i'm going i'll [du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	i came too far where i've been now for three years i haven't had ( my own place w* ) my own place in three years in couple decades and they took me i it wasn't easy
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+3	i don't wanna lose my place i don't wanna go back out there on the streets
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like ( there would be some ) there could be severe consequences based just on using cocaine okay
client.r+3	yes
client.r+3	there will be
client.r+3	mm-hmm so yeah
counselor.res	( um ) so ( you me* ) you mentioned that there were ( like ) patterns of behavior things that you do over and over again
-	-
client.r+3	yeah going around people that i know they ain't no good just using what is that about [laugh] why am i [du] i know what they're doing so why would i even wanna entertain the thought of going around those people
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	you know stuff like that
-	-
client.fn	( you know )
counselor.rec	kind of caught yourself doing that it sounds like you said kinda like ahh yeah i could see myself doing that
client.fn	yeah
client.r+3	yeah i mean i
client.r+3	know what they're doing so why would i wanna go around them
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.res	i see so you find yourself ( throughout ) throughout the day
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	is this ( like ) every day or most days
client.fn	no not
client.fn	every day
counselor.res	not every day
counselor.quc	a couple days a week or
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and i start my ( uh uh ) ( i'm going ) i'm gonna start me some outpatient volunteer
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( um ) and as a matter of fact she'll probably call me this afternoon and let me know what day i start yeah i even started that no i'm not on probation or none of that deal so [du] none of that and i just yeah i did do that [du] see
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	definitely yeah and it sounds like there's ( like a ) maybe a sense of pride about getting this stuff together and trying to seek help for you
client.fn	mm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	so i don't know ( which day ) what days ( um ) i start ( you know ) i'm going to outpatient ( uh ) three days a week
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like you have a strong awareness of what you're doing where you need to be and what you need to do to do that and ( you're ) you're already getting some of that in place but you're still finding yourself doing some of these behaviors
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm
client.fn	my old thoughts
counselor.res	some old thoughts even
client.fn	thoughts
counselor.rec	okay so some of it's the old behaviors like hanging around people who are using when you know that's what they're doing but then there's also ( some ) some thoughts ( that ) that keep this going as well
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	mm-hmm yeah i'm curious about ( what ) what maybe some of those thoughts are ( if you ) if you're okay with sharing them
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) some of the thoughts of
-	-
counselor.res	sound like you said some of those old thoughts keep you
-	-
counselor.res	going
client.fn	yeah ( uh ) well maybe if ( uh ) i don't use i could steal me some money [laugh]
client.r+3	ahh ( uh ) doesn't work been there done that [laugh]
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.rec	so it's not working for you
client.fn	no
-	-
client.r+3	no no
counselor.res	no
-	-
counselor.rec	( so it's actually it's a ) so it's costing you more money than you
client.r+3	than i would like yeah [laugh]
counselor.rec	should be spen*
counselor.fa	okay [laugh]
client.r+3	and ( i i you know ) i don't have a significant other i don't have nobody helping me pay my bills and this like and they're not ( like ) yeah i'm spending money that is just not it's really not there for me to be trying to spend it
counselor.fa	hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	right it sounds like ( it's ) it's hard to get by
client.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.r+3	( i* ) yeah and it seem like it's getting harder ( when i ) when i wasn't entertaining those thoughts or before i relapsed ( those were ) i was doing okay now it seem like [du] i'm coming up short [laugh] and everything
counselor.res	a*
counselor.fa	uh-huh yeah
client.r+3	( you know ) i wasn't having this problem a year ago and
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah it's almost like ( you're you're you're coming up you're com* ) you notice that you're coming up short and you're thinking ( like th* ) there's a red flag there
client.fn	but ( uh )
client.r+3	yeah oh they're pop* man they're popping yeah they're popping up ( you know ) and ( like ) up ooh so yeah
counselor.res	[laugh] they're popping up
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	yeah and you also said that it ( sound ) seemed like there was some relationship between using and your health
-	-
client.fn	yeah well ( i'm i i ) i'm h_i_v well i'm closer to aids now
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	but ( uh ) yeah ( you know ) i'm a diabetic i'm big i got liver problems oh god ( uh ) heart problem well ( uh ) everything besides being a diabetic i've had for quite some time
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	well i was born with the heart thing ( uh ) i've been hiv well i've known that since ninety_three
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but my health is s* ( um ) and i've never been on the medication but now that my count has gotten low they want me to start on the medication
counselor.fa	mm-hmmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	and ( uh ) [du] and then i relapsed so [du] well that's really not the answer [du]
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.su	well it sounds like it's just been a real ( s* ) stressful trip for you
client.fn	yeah the last ( f* uh ) yeah six or seven months and it's like ahh la la la la la
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	and there's ( something that ) something about ( if ) if cocaine was out of the picture or scaled back that this would be a little bit
-	-
client.o+3	yeah an association yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) because ( i'm ) i'm not a i've always been a loner ( i don't ) i don't do neighbors and i don't have people coming over to my house and stuff like that but ( uh ) yeah ( i i i ) i find myself going what's that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm so ( some of that s* s* some ) some of that might be ( making ) just making a connection with all those people also who use drugs that's kind of become a strong association between seeking out people but people ( who ) who use drugs yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	but yeah
counselor.quo	( um ) so what do you ( uh ) there must be something about it that does do something for you
-	-
client.r-3	( i i ) i [du] well ( uh ) for me over the years i think it just got to be a comfort zone
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm sure well it sounds like you could use the comfort i mean it sounds like you could use some comfort i don't say that comfort but some comfort
client.fn	right but yeah
client.r-3	( you know and ) and over the years that's what i was comfortable with
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-3	( you ) you know and not that that was all i knew but i was more comfortable in those surroundings
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-3	so that's what i went to and then when i relapsed i went to where i was more comfortable with
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( i di* ) i don't
-	-
counselor.quo	i wonder what's comfortable about it ( like ) what
-	-
client.r+3	i don't know just ( uh ) well it's really not comfortable
client.r-3	[laugh] but ( um uh ) that probably ain't the word right ( uh just ) i don't know ( uh ) i don't know just being around people that are just thinking the same
client.fn	( i ) i don't know i don't really know how to explain it
-	-
counselor.rec	( so ) so w* so there's some sort of sharing of experience ( with ) with these people then
-	-
client.fn	yeah just
counselor.quc	( is it is it the ) is it
client.fn	well
counselor.gi	oh go ahead i'm sorry
-	-
client.fn	yeah it's ( uh ) i don't know i don't really know how to explain ( uh )
-	-
client.r-3	( uh ) i don't know i guess just being around a certain kind of people who ( i ) i can do things and that if i was with somebody that wasn't using i can't do
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-3	( you know um ) it's not a big deal doing whatever it is that i feel like or need to do around this group of people that's [du] people that don't i can't ( you know )
-	-
counselor.rec	so even though it's a group ( that ) that uses cocaine and stuff like that there's something that's still
-	-
client.r-3	( we have a common ) there's a common whatever you wanna call it
-	-
counselor.rec	it's like a understanding or you guys go through some of the same things or very
client.fn	or yeah
client.fn	something
client.fn	like yeah
client.fn	things that yeah i don't
client.fn	really know how to word it but i know what i'm trying to say ( you know ) yeah
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	you've got some shared experiences and ( you're ) it sounds like they're pretty accepting of the things that you need to do
-	-
client.r-3	( l* ) yeah ( and i'm ) and vice versa
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah yeah ( so there ) so yeah ( so there's ) there is something positive about this group of people that's there's something that you're getting out of hanging out with them but then you're also using drugs with them that sounds like yeah
client.fn	uh-huh
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	and it's
-	-
client.r+3	it's no way for nobody to be nobody mm-hmm so yeah mm mm mm
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.su	yeah ( that's been a ) it's been a rough ride for you ( up and ) up and down huh
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yes it has been [du] last four or five month [du]
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm so it sounds like i mean you told me there was a lot of kind of like negative things you're seeing connection between your use and your health the money ( um ) and [du] it was almost just ( uh ) like there's something about using that's just not where you wanna be at
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+3	yeah [du] i'm just going through the motions and the novelty wore off quite a few decades [laugh] ago pretty much ( um ) yeah i just it's tasteless
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i don't yeah i don't ugh i'm not tryin
counselor.res	tasteless
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	( but then on the ) so then on the other side the positives is ( it ) you get ( to ) to hang around these people you kinda get a social support that way as well
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and oh i can make some money
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	why don't you all get a job what what [laugh]
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.quc	( you ) that you could make some money
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.quc	or ( they ) they
counselor.nc	[du]
client.fn	well i can
-	-
counselor.res	( your ) you can
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm and i have
-	-
counselor.rec	( uh ) through selling
client.fn	but
client.r+3	easy to come easy go dirty money
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	as soon as you get some you spend it
client.fn	yeah
client.r+3	dirty money it's no good it's not [du] mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	and ( uh when you ) when you ( uh ) well i know for me when i tend to get it like that ( it's it's uh ) fast as it comes it goes because it doesn't mean anything it doesn't have no value to it ( you know ) i didn't really work for it honestly so ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	so something about earning money that way that doesn't sit well with you as well
client.r+3	n* no
-	-
client.r+3	( you know i i ) i've been through that ( you know ) and the end result is always the same always
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	and it sounds like lately you find yourself more scraping by than you'd like to be
-	-
client.r+3	yup exactly because there's no need for that
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	yeah so and then the positive side ( was the ) was the relationships
client.fn	excuse me
counselor.quc	was there anything else positive about it that
-	-
client.r+3	no there's nothing positive about none of that
-	-
counselor.res	no it's just hanging around with the friends
client.r-3	friends that yeah
counselor.quo	( and then ) and then what happens ( like ) when you're with these people ( like ) how does it turn into ( um ) using
-	-
client.fn	( well because ) well ( for m* ) for me ( i ) i've always pretty much been a loner and i don't really need a buddy to [laugh] to ( uh ) do whatever i need to do commit a crime or whatever
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( and um ) which is i'm not trying to go there either
client.r-3	( um ) i don't know like i said it's just something that everybody has in common with each other
client.r-3	everybody understands [du] he had to do what he had to do she had to do what she had to do type of thing
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+d3	and ( i ) i just don't really care to for none of it i don't
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	( um ) because it's always ended up the same for me ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	and what was that
counselor.quo	( like ) what was the
counselor.quo	same
client.r+3	going to prison
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+3	or get sick
-	-
counselor.res	go to prison or get sick
client.fn	yeah ( you know )
counselor.rec	so ( it's ) it's always some pretty bad consequences
client.r+3	conse*
client.r+3	yeah and it always has been ( for m* ) for me
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah and it sounds like there's been periods of time where you've been clean and you've seen the other side of the coin
client.fn	and since i yeah
-	-
client.r+3	and i know what it is and i feel much better about myself when i'm clean
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+3	( you know ) ( a* you know i ) i don't [du] you know i don't do things that i enjoy doing
client.r+d3	( you know ) i don't really like ru* running around out on the streets [laugh]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	( you know i ) yeah i just don't do things that liz enjoys doing ju* for herself
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+3	( you know and you know ) i go and spend forty or fifty dollars on some dope or what about those tennis shoes you was talking about you wanted yesterday you know i say to myself oh no well i'll get em tomorrow or later
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah so ( you ) if you spend the money on the dope like you said that ends up being kinda meaningless whereas you could be treating yourself
client.fn	some
-	-
client.r+3	yeah and appreciating it because i could look at my shoes and yeahh
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	you've been wanting those
-	-
client.r+3	yeah yeah ( you know ) and i i was like oh god yeah so
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	and so ( when you were when you were clean ) the periods in your life that you've been clean you've noticed that that's kind of what the experience has been like it's pretty
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+3	( and ) and that's how i like to be because i like things
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah i even see you bubble up a little bit when you talk about it [laugh]
client.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	yeah
client.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	so ( uh ) yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah so ( that's a ) that's a better time for you it sounds like
client.fn	so
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.res	yeah and so ( you s* ) you said you were taking ( some ) some next steps ( to ) to get there and you said that you were
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yeah so my outpatient ( um it'll pro* ) it probably won't be this week but next week but all the paperwork and everything is done
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	so they'll be calling me and [du] she said she was gonna call me monday because i talked to her on friday
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

client.fn	and this is all volunteer
-	-
counselor.res	a voluntary ( out ) outpatient
client.fn	mm
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	you look like ( you're very ) you're ready for that it looks like you're anticipating it
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	( um ) and ( what are the ) what are your goals for that program
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) to complete the program and ( um s* you know s* ) start being more productive with myself ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( uh ) more structure i need more structure
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.res	yeah so is there some things that you would like to be productive with
-	-
client.fn	with myself
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( that's i just ) when i leave here i'm going to the house put on some tennis shoes and a light jacket and go and buy me some ice cream and stuff [laugh] and come back to the house ( uh just you know )
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	otherwise i would probably just go because ( i ) i fell into a really bad depression mode here
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	and mm ( i use i ) i just don't wanna fall back into that mode you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	yeah yeah and so is this outpatient program is it a drug treatment program
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	yeah okay okay it's a
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o+3	well you see how severe [laugh] that's pretty bad
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	( you know )
counselor.gi	it's the top of the chart
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	so ( i mean where would you ) where would you like to be on that
-	-
client.r+d3	at no risk
-	-
counselor.res	at no risk so you'd wanna be down there
counselor.gi	( so ) so your goals for using and so i saw on this sheet that you wrote that you wanna quit using once and for all
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.adw	and so ( i mean ) there's a lot of different things that you could do one is definitely to quit once and for all

client.r-2	because i smoke the weed it helps me with the pain because i have arthritis
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r-2	so it helps me with my pain a lot ( you know ) especially because i'm not on my other medications that i normally take for it
counselor.fa	okay

counselor.nc	[laugh]

client.r+2	( you know ) because ( that ) does surprise me ( i you know ) i'm not that type of person ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah

counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	it's for the pain

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.o+2	( you know ) and like i said once i get because i'm getting my vicodins and my percocets that will give me ( you know ) the pain relief without using the marijuana
-	-
counselor.res	okay so right now you're not getting ( your ) your pain medications

counselor.quo	uh-huh ( um ) if you were to stop how would you what would you see as
counselor.quc	do you see any problems with not doing it
client.fn	no
client.fn	no
counselor.quc	even if you didn't get your vicodin and that would there be more of an issue then
client.o-2	then then yeah
-	-
client.r-2	( because of ) because it does help me with the pain
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+2	( you know ) if i have something to help me with the pain ( th* you know ) then yeah i would leave it alone
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+2	and it wouldn't be a problem i wouldn't have withdrawals because it's not a big deal i mean i've gone for months without smoking
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	but i've suffered a lot of pain during it
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah yeah

counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-d2	i mean ( i i i ) i do enjoy it
client.r-2	( you know ) and it does help me with the pain
client.r-d2	and like i said when i have my medicine and i did smoke my weed ( it was just ) it's because of pleasure because i did like the high
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	but ( you know ) without my other medicine it's more for the pain than it is for the high
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+2	and no ( it's not uh it's not ) it's not like trying to quit cocaine or heroin or anything like that ( you know ) or have that kinda withdrawal it's not like that at all
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+2	( you know ) i just don't eat as much ( you know ) if i'm not smoking it so
-	-
counselor.quc	is that a good thing or a bad thing
-	-
client.r+2	it's a good thing because i've gained a lot of weight here ( late ) lately
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+2	so ( you know ) and that's because when you smoke you get hungry and then you eat and you gain the weight
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+2	( you know ) but ( uh ) i can do without that because i wanna lose weight anyway i'm ( a_hundred_and_six ) a_hundred_and_seventy_six pounds i'm only four_foot_ten_and_three_quarters
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+2	that's a lot of weight for my body to be carrying
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.o+2	so ( you know ) yeah ( i ) yeah once i got my medicine yeah i'd quit
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+2	( you know if ) if i find other things that would help with the pain i would quit i would quit with it so
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

counselor.rec	buy a tank of gas

client.fn	i went in there thirty days came out and started drinking again
client.fn	( i ) and i know thirty days don't work ( you have to ) if you want to stop you have to have more time
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	you have to do it and you have to do it for yourself you can't do it for nobody
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( you know i ca* ) i went in saying ( i'm ) okay i'm gonna quit for my daughter it doesn't it wasn't nothing

client.fn	( you know ) she was behind me she was and my brothers ( my ) my family was behind me when i stopped
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) and i to me that was a big thing ( having support to ) for me having support is a big thing
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	because ( uh mm ) to me if i don't have support i don't care
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.r+2	( you know ) so and i ( you know ) with mike and charlotte i know i have my support for that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+2	( you know if ) but if i do get that urge that i really need it ( you know ) i can talk to mike
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+2	mike i mean he'll take me to the park and play frisbee with me ( or ) ( you know ) or barbecue or ( you know ) laugh and carry on ( you know ) to distract me from that [du] so
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.res	so you'd mentioned the benefit to you is what was ( the mo* ) the big motivation ( for ) for [du] drinking
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	what is the benefit to you for stopping the pot
-	-
client.fn	the benefit for me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.fn	that's a good question because i dunno
client.r+2	i mean saving the money ( would be a big ) would be a benefit for me because i would be able to do more for myself with that extra money ( like ) if i wanted new clothes or i wanted to do my hair or what ( you know ) join a fitness center or whatever
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm okay
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+2	( you know ) that would be a big plus for me
client.r+2	not gaining extra weight would be a big plus for me ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+2	it'd be a big benefit ( you know ) because my husband says the weight might be a lot of the reason why i have a lot of pain in my knees and my hips is because of the weight extra weight
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+2	i have never in my life been a_hundred_and_seventy_six pounds a_hundred_and_fifty has been the most ( you know ) so that extra twenty_six pounds yeah it could be a lot of my pain ( you know ) i know i have arthritis but it could ( be ) still be a lot of other things ( you know ) so yeah
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.r+2	so loss of the weight
client.r+2	the money i could spend on myself or on us ( you know ) that's a big gain for me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	mm-hmm so those are two of the big gains
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	okay all right well it does sound like you've got your supports in place ( um ) and it also sounds like you've come up with some reasons that it might be a benefit for you
client.fn	yeah
counselor.st	yeah yeah so that's all i need to do probably i'll try and be in touch with you or charlotte will we can follow up with you
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) this is for you if you want it
counselor.adp	i dunno if you wanna post it someplace or not
client.fn	yeah no i want
-	-
client.o+2	i want my husband to see it so he can see where i'm at with my weed smoking ( you know ) and where i could be ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.st	right so ( and and um ) and then ( you know ) you just need to follow up as they call you to continue on if it's a benefit for you to do that
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	here's your gift card and there will be more of those as they talk to you
client.fn	okay
client.fn	okay
counselor.nc	we can stop this
counselor.nc	i'm remembering how to use this tape recorder

-	-
counselor.af	great then ( um )
-	-
client.fn	i even cleared [du] called on [du] answers to that
-	-
counselor.af	okay good
-	-
client.fn	i was this telling ( wha* ) what was her name
-	-
counselor.gi	alicia
-	-
client.fn	alicia that's what i thought
client.fn	i was telling alicia we could had much more of a colorful conversation if we had this about three_and_a_half years ago
-	-
counselor.fa	really
-	-
client.fn	( uhh yeah ) [laughs] it definitely had worked
-	-
counselor.rec	( s* ) so i know ( from that ) from that ( um ) comment that you were using more three_and_a_half years ago
client.fn	comment
-	-
client.fn	no i quit drinking three and a half four years ago just all together so
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	( okay ) i remember you mentioning that you were in recovery the last time we talked
-	-
client.fn	actually i don't even perceive it that way anymore it's ( um )
-	-
counselor.gi	( yeah ) recovery was my word it wasn't your word
-	-
client.fn	yeah because ( it's not it's it's it's ) it's nothing in my mind that [du]
client.fn	when i quit i didn't i wasn't obsessed with it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( um ) i mean didn't really didn't went away
-	-
counselor.af	( hmm ) wow
-	-
client.fn	and that's
-	-
counselor.quc	did you kind of had an epiphany or anything that
-	-
client.fn	yeah when my dad died
-	-
counselor.fa	( oh )
-	-
client.fn	i quit the day after my dad died
client.fn	or after i got back from burying my father
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( and uh ) i wasn't even plan on quitting i had given up on the idea of quitting
-	-
counselor.fa	really
-	-
client.fn	( oh yeah um and ) for some reason i woke up the very next day back here in washington i just woke up
client.fn	i hadn't really even thought about it you know [du] me
client.r+1	i just woke and said yeah i needed to grow up somehow
client.fn	and ( um ) [du] i'm drink for almost four years
-	-
counselor.af	wow that's amazing
counselor.gi	that's a big event a parent passing away that's ( um ) major
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) actually i was just thinking you know i can't wait to see what's more [du] kinda release the other half die [laugh]
-	-
counselor.quc	( hmm um ) can we chat about ( um ) the paperwork
-	-
client.fn	of course absolutely that's what we're here for
-	-
counselor.gi	( okay so one ) of the you answered a lot of the questions with alicia
counselor.gi	and ( um one of the um one um one sec* ) one section of the questions that you answered is called the dast the drug abuse screening tool
-	-
client.fn	( umm okay )
-	-
counselor.gi	it's a ten point screen
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	and it measures the risk of harm that one might um have in relation to their substance use
counselor.gi	and so on a scale of um actually zero to ten
counselor.gi	uh how does it go here zero being no risk one or two being some risk three to five being moderate risk six to ten being severe risk
counselor.quc	where do you think you fall on that scale
-	-
client.fn	today zero to three
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	i think that's where it is
-	-
counselor.gi	okay so on the dast you scored a four
counselor.quo	so what
-	-
client.fn	close enough
-	-
counselor.res	close enough
counselor.gi	well and actually um a zero to three well so this is the triangle here
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	so zero to two is ( um ) no risk to some risk
counselor.gi	( um ) three is moderate risk four is moderate risk
-	-
client.o+7	( uh ) i'm gonna go with that ( i ) i do have the track record to prove going off on that
-	-
counselor.res	( okay so so ) you say it's congruent
client.fn	i'd say
-	-
client.o+7	yeah i'd say looking at a overall thing i'm moderate risk would be a fairest option
-	-
counselor.quo	okay tell me more about that
counselor.quo	why is that
-	-
client.fn	my last i mean there isn't really a drug out there that i haven't done
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( um ) i can't say that there wasn't a drug out there that i didn't enjoy
client.r+d5	except amphetamines i'm not a speak freak
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( um ) up until recently they've always been my emotional escape
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r-7	as of right now i'm under probably the largest emotional stress any one human being could possibly be under in their life
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r-7	and i'm all alone i probably at severe risk level right now
client.r+7	but i just happen to know better
-	-
counselor.rec	so severe is for ( uh ) relapse
counselor.quc	is that what you mean
-	-
client.o+7	( yeah ) i mean if ( i ) i would if i was looking at myself from just a clinical point of view i'd say he's high risk
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+7	( you know ) as far is let's make sure that he's got ( you know ) certain things going
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+d7	but because of my own desire ( to uh ) to have changed my life without any external influences made that decision for me
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( um ) then i'd put it back to moderate under these circumstances
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+7	and different circumstances i'd still probably be at a moderate at risk
client.r-7	because i've always used it as an escape
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+7	and until it was something engraved in my behavior pattern as far as emotional [du] it'll always exist
-	-
counselor.quo	and how as an escape did it harm you
counselor.quo	how did the substance use harm you
-	-
client.r+7	[sigh] i walked out of a doctor's office two weeks ago and gave me five months to live
-	-
counselor.gi	well
-	-
client.r+7	i think that's a real good direct cause of how this happens
-	-
counselor.fa	i see
-	-
client.r+7	because that is cause and affect
-	-
counselor.rec	your liver disease is the
-	-
client.fn	it's 'cause of hepatitis c.
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm it's not because of your substances
-	-
client.r+7	more than likely
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	but ( even if ) even if not just because of my social behaviors ( any ) any thought of any kind of treatment or possible getting out of this
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	would be ( ou* ou* ) out the window because my social primer is just wouldn't even be close to within or even worth it
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( um so ya know umm ) but as far as except of diagnosed with ( ya know ) liver cancer ( uh yeah ) i attempted suicide last april almost successful
client.fn	um i always [du] with my friends i'd had me a good stiff martini with that one didn't even cross my mind didn't even cross my mind [sniff]
-	-
counselor.fa	( hmm )
-	-
client.o+1	i never run into another reason to drink ever since then i quit
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+1	and i've been through hell and back
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i have more than half a dozen people die on me
-	-
counselor.res	mm-hmm yeah i remember you telling me this last time
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	it's been a lot
-	-
counselor.res	it's been a lot ( yeah )
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( so as ) far as to what we are doing on the survey
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	no ( i i ) i'd say four is moderate
client.o+7	( ya know ) looking at the clinical point of view ( um ) at my past behavior ( yeah ) i had moderate risk ( yeah )
-	-
counselor.gi	( mm-hmm okay and um ) there's two boxes checked here
counselor.gi	but ( ah i ) i ( kinda ) think that one of them is not counting
-	-
client.fn	probably
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	is it life expectancy
-	-
counselor.gi	the opiates for pain which is ( um )
-	-
client.fn	two boxes were checked
client.fn	well that wasn't being honest
-	-
counselor.gi	( so um ) i'm not sure ( that ) these are included at all when your answering these questions up here
-	-
client.fn	i don't know
-	-
counselor.gi	that's why i'm saying ( i i ) i don't see how this one ( um ) can count right now because you are
counselor.quc	( okay so ) this is opiates that are being prescribed for pain which are related to your ( um ) liver disease right
counselor.quc	and have they ( um ) done a biopsy on that yet
counselor.quc	are they going to do a biopsy
-	-
client.fn	i've already done chemo ( on ) on mobilization
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	( yeah ) they ( um ) did the first half of the chemo on mobilization
client.fn	( uh ) we could go tuesday
-	-
counselor.quc	( so did they ) did they confirm that it's a pata cellular carcinoma
-	-
client.fn	( oh yeah )
-	-
counselor.gi	because when i think i last saw you that was suspected but not yet confirmed
-	-
client.fn	( yeah ) well i suspected that it was confirmed a long time ago
client.fn	they were just trying to be even today call or having a hard time looking at me square in the face and saying yeah we're telling you your going to die
-	-
counselor.fa	( hmm )
-	-
client.fn	and she's still having a hard time using those words
client.fn	and i'm ( like ) come on you know let's not candy coat
-	-
counselor.quc	is that polycost sot
-	-
client.fn	[du]
-	-
counselor.gi	that's whether ( umm ) yeah doctors don't like to use those words because ( it's um as if it's that that ) they're predicting the future and they don't like to do that
-	-
client.fn	well no they're not
client.fn	they're just presuming that the reality of the future with facts presented to them
client.fn	that unless those facts are changed that will be a reality
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	that's not fortune telling
client.fn	( that's just taking ) that's ( like ) looking at this and going from what we know from what we've seen to where you're going and you don't do this ( this ) is where you're going to be
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm yeah
-	-
client.fn	( but ) but even to this day she has a hard time just talking just saying you know i have to [du]
client.fn	don't worry about that i'm used to the idea
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yeah well really i'm not but the words don't make you just curl up and die
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm you're not avoiding the world anymore
-	-
client.fn	i never was yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	( i knew ) i knew where i was before i even came here
-	-
counselor.fa	did ya wow
-	-
client.fn	[du] back to this
-	-
counselor.st	yes back to this [sigh] ( okay um )
-	-
client.fn	( so ) yes i believe this does not apply to that
-	-
counselor.quc	right and ( um ) have you been how long have you been smoking marijuana
-	-
client.fn	oh since i was twelve
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	thirteen years old
-	-
counselor.rec	( so ) it started before the cancer ( and so ) it's not
-	-
client.fn	( oh yeah ) a matter of fact my step-father [du] bought me my first bong
-	-
counselor.fa	( hmm )
-	-
client.fn	interesting huh
-	-
counselor.fa	yes
-	-
client.fn	yeah [sigh]
-	-
counselor.quo	so what are your thoughts on that
counselor.quo	how do you feel on your marijuana use
-	-
client.fn	actually you know ( it's ) it's gotten to the point where i'm curious about it
client.fn	so therefore ( in ) in certain ways ( this s s ) this is going to be interesting experiment
client.r+n2	because i have to quit
client.r+2	because ( um ) 'cause if i'm smoking then i ( prob* ) probably [err] won't be eligible for the liver transplant
-	-
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	( yeah ) i have to and most of the ( you know ) ninety_eight percent of my social point ( are ) were ready in line you know as far as being eligible [du] major trying for that
client.o+2	( and so ) and i think it would be interesting because ( um i ) as i'm getting more and more conscious ( um ) i'm starting to question my on reasoning of why i would do that
client.fn	because one thing i really [du] 'cause there is one thing that can worse than this and [du]
client.fn	because i love [du] me
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( i i i ) i think my mind is weak
client.fn	and mean they are lost and everybody should think they're ready weak
client.fn	( uh ) but my mind is an incredible thing and it works incredibly well
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+2	( uh ) and it's time to use it and i don't want to gamble
client.fn	so ( i i ) even before this came up over the last i don't know six months or so i think just playing around backin' off
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	[du] you know i guess where it goes ( ya know )
-	-
counselor.rec	( mm-hmm so ) so you have more than one motivation then
counselor.af	that's great
counselor.rec	you have
-	-
client.r+2	( oh yeah ) i know
-	-
counselor.rec	you have the motivation of ( um ) maybe to qualify or wanting to qualify for the liver transplant and the motivation of really wanting to enjoy your mind and how you think ( and ) and to stay sharp and yeah
-	-
client.o-7	( yeah ) exactly and ( you know um ) even if it comes appropriate in my life to do so ( um ) i want to pick and choose a ( little ) little shall we say more pleasantly
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.o-7	( yeah know ) if i'm going to do such thing i'm going to embrace it in the way i used to embrace it [du]
client.o-1	and that's with the right company a nice fire place and a warm stiff of cognac [du] and there's so much sense in life to enjoy things
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.fn	( so )
-	-
counselor.quo	and ( um ) what is the
counselor.res	( uh ) so ( he he's ) you mentioned a few minutes ago
counselor.quc	but ( um so ) you've been backing off
-	-
client.fn	( hmm-mm )
-	-
counselor.quo	what've you been doing
counselor.quo	tell me more about that
-	-
client.r+n2	( just uh ) just ( you know ) aware of what i need to do
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.fn	and just instead of unconsciously going oh sure i'll take a hit ( um ) consciously though i'll wait
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.fn	there's a better time for me
-	-
counselor.quc	( so ) have you actually then reduced your use
-	-
client.ts+2	( oh yeah ) by almost eighty percent
-	-
counselor.af	wow that's great
-	-
client.ts+2	[du] down to three joints a day down to maybe quarter of the joint ( um )
-	-
counselor.quc	just the period of time were diagnosed
-	-
client.fn	just sixteen days
-	-
counselor.af	that's great wow
-	-
client.r+a2	i put alcohol by myself i can do anything
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.fn	( i mean i i ) it was six months before i went to aa meeting after i quit
client.fn	i was never stranger to aa or any of that
client.fn	( yeah i mean ) i've been riddled with a classic problem with any substance [laugh] abuse that one tunes to get towards the latter part the of their addictions [laugh] ( um )
-	-
counselor.ec	so it sounds like your one of those lucky people who once you set your mind to doing something you can do it on your own
counselor.quc	you don't need any support you don't need any ( um ) regular check in with a support group or anything like that or
-	-
client.fn	i enjoy it
client.fn	but actually i find it more annoying
client.fn	but depending on how it's all approached
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.fn	( you know um ) i find it particularly annoying
client.fn	( um ) [du] made beneficial in certain areas
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.fn	( um ) but i think it's an absolute farce
client.fn	and i think it is an absolute joke that people really honestly think that they can be born in alcohol
client.fn	i do not ( i i ) i'm [du] between both sides of that argument disease or affliction
client.fn	well one of my arguments used to be when i was leaning towards the disease side of it was you can be born diabetic or you can create the scenario in your or create diabetes through poor diet or whatever
client.fn	[sigh] really it such unless you were born with alcohol fetal syndrome you cannot be [du] alcoholic
client.fn	you can be born with the social parameters to make you one you can have a drunk mother a drunk father
client.fn	but that's not being passed on to your genetic cellular level as your maturing in the womb
client.fn	it means you are probably cursed from the second you get out that warm happy place [laugh] but that just the way it goes
client.fn	( and and where i ) and where people i think it confused with it is that most alcoholics are even really moved to talk about it or even participate in any legitimate research it gets to certain point with their affliction
client.fn	and by that time almost everything about it does look like a disease because they've inflicted it upon themselves
client.fn	because ( like ) anything if you eat only twinkies you will become diabetic and therefore what started as an infliction now is a disease
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.fn	same with alcohol
client.fn	what started as an affliction manifested into a disease
client.fn	because nobody and i mean no physical corral being i don't care about mine he's capable of injecting one practical substance especially poison without having its adverse affect and it will manifest itself as a disease
-	-
counselor.quc	( so ) is that a big argument in aa
counselor.gi	i wasn't aware of that
counselor.quc	is it a kind of a philosophical under pendulum you have to get on board with in order to a
-	-
client.fn	( no no ) no you don't have to be on board with it
client.fn	you supposedly ( you know ) have to be board with on anything but
-	-
counselor.gi	well right [laugh]
-	-
client.fn	( whateva um but ) it is one ( that ) that a lot of alcoholics like to favor
client.fn	because first of all it takes absolute responsibility of the
client.fn	a i was to born do remember roger_rabbit the movie
-	-
counselor.gi	( um-hmm oh ) that came out a long time ago
counselor.gi	( so ) the details are fuzzy but ( yeah ) i remember
-	-
client.fn	[du] you know the bad bunny in the picture
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.fn	she goes don't hit me because i'm bad i was just drawn that way
-	-
counselor.gi	[laughs] yeah that was a good movie
-	-
client.fn	[laugh] ( ah well ) [du] ( you know ) you're not drawn that way
client.fn	( you know and and and you know um ) having it becomes ( a disease ) a weird disease which is very convenient on a wild level
client.fn	first and foremost it takes away the responsibility it wasn't all me
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) then who the hell was it
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( yeah and you know ah and and it it gives ) it gives a nice a squeaky little back [du] i mean this behavior that might happen again
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) it leaves room for oh well i slipped but it's a disease i'll keep [du]
client.fn	( ah ) that's bullshit you know and they use it as a way to just kind of keep the revolving door open pretty door stopping that sucker you think
-	-
counselor.fa	( um-hmm )
-	-
client.fn	[laugh] ( um ) not allowing it to be a disease it is a choice ( um )
client.fn	because you are ultimately responsible for your own choices [du]
-	-
counselor.ec	( yeah ) it seems so much more empowering to make it a choice ( uh you know ah )
-	-
client.fn	i would think
-	-
counselor.fa	( yeah )
-	-
client.fn	unless if you seem to be one of those people that are shamelessly unsuccessful at it
client.fn	which unfortunately most people are not
-	-
counselor.st	( so um um ) back to the original question
-	-
client.nc	[nvv]
-	-
counselor.st	are you one of these people who can do things once you put your mind to it
counselor.quc	( i ) is that how it's feeling with ( uh ) giving up the marijuana
counselor.quc	that you feel ( like yeah ) this is fine i'm gonna be able to do this
-	-
client.r+a2	( oh ) yeah
-	-
counselor.af	good
-	-
client.r+a2	yeah i mean that's no big deal
-	-
counselor.af	good
-	-
client.r+2	( i mean the way ) i look at it saves me money for my toys
client.r+2	i have too much of an imagination ( to um to uh nvv ) everything is doing great
client.r+2	( you know i mean ) i saved a couple of months worth what i used to spend on [du] probably having a nice decent night or two nice snort somewhere
-	-
counselor.st	yes ( so ) i wanted to ask you about stress too
counselor.res	because last time you and i spoke there were ( um ) a lot of stress isn't
counselor.gi	stress make it difficult to achieve a goal
-	-
client.fn	if that would ( it ) it yes it does
client.fn	( uh ) but a matter of fact i would've done a lot of things ( uh ) stress [du]
-	-
counselor.gi	( well and i uh um and ) i asked this in a spirit this intervention but also in the spirit of i lost encounter
counselor.gi	you and i was supposed to follow up
-	-
client.fn	i'd just split the two
-	-
counselor.gi	( yes it and i and i ) i've been told you don't have to split ( um ) the roles completely
counselor.gi	( so ) i can be interventionist and social worker and at the same time thank goodness
counselor.rec	( um so um ) you are committed to this goal of ( um ) giving up marijuana
counselor.af	which is great
counselor.gi	and ( um ) i want to just offer any support you need around ( um ) creating whatever you need to create in order to ( um )
-	-
client.fn	( oh ) trust me i'm sure you're on my schedule somewhere [du]
-	-
counselor.gi	well you know i checked the other day and you weren't on my schedule
-	-
client.fn	( w* w* ) well
-	-
counselor.gi	there's no follow up appointments ( so )
-	-
client.fn	we need to correct that then
-	-
counselor.gi	( yeah 'cause i i think that this is
counselor.quc	uh ) have you applied for social security yet
-	-
client.fn	no [sigh]
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	i did not ( i* i* ) i've

-	-
counselor.su	yeah it's probably just keeping track of all the medical appointments and such
client.fn	uh
client.fn	it's enough just so i can just walk through everyday
-	-
counselor.fa	hm-hmm

client.fn	( um ) yeah ( you know ) but i hope it helps in the long run
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	okay alright well one of the things he did with the total numbers was to add it up and score you on a dast score
counselor.gi	and that's this little pyramid here and it's called the drug_alcohol_and_abuse_assessments_tool
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	and so ( it kinda ) looking at what other people have and ( what ) the way you responded to the answers it kinda puts you at a seven which is up here at the top of the pyramid
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	does that surprise you
-	-
client.o+7	( um ) no ( i w* ) i wanna be really honest with them i do know that i have a serious problem

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.quo	so ( tell me w* ) tell me about that
counselor.quo	tell me what you've done as far as trying to control it
counselor.quc	and first of all what is it [laugh] to control
client.fn	well
client.fn	as far as my ( my uh ) drug addiction ( uh ) it's not a lot of drugs it's basically one drug
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+7	( a* and um and ) and for the longest time ( i've i've um ) i've always ( um ) said to myself that i can go ( a ) a week ( c* ) couple weeks without doing it ( and and i ) but i just go right back to it again you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	( and and um ) so within those two weeks i don't do it i go out get a job ( you know ) i communicate well and everything
counselor.fa	wow
client.r+7	but once you start working ( you can't ) you can't mix them both together and that's when problems start
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) but i've been doing it a long long time you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	how long
client.o+7	( and ) and people have asked me do you have a drug problem and ( i'll say ) i'll deny it ( you know ) and i know the rules that ( that uh ) after four days you're clean in case they do give a urine test and the whole little sneaky game ( you know ) ( that ) that people play ( when ) when they don't wanna confess that they have a problem ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+d7	but i want to end that

client.o+7	( there )
client.o+7	( there ) there's a problem there there is a problem there
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+d7	( uh ) the only green light that i see is like today i don't wanna do it and i'm not thinking about it at all
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	it's not like ( uh ) there's a lot of drug people ( that ) that every day they go out and try to find it you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	my mind is a little bit more i guess complicated but the result ends up the same i still can go out and get it when i want to ( a* ) and
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	mm-hmm so what's different today
counselor.quo	( w* ) why don't you want to
counselor.quo	go out
client.r+d7	i want to end ( that ) that's the whole reason why i'm here ( i want ) i want this little cycle to end
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so i wanna see if i can ( dr* ) get directed the right way i've never spoke to a social worker or a case manager or nothing like that ( men* ) mental evaluation counselor or nothing
counselor.fa	uh-huh uh-huh
counselor.rec	okay ( so ) but it sounds like there are days that when ( you're using that when you're not ) you choose not to use that there's something going on within you that makes you decide today isn't gonna be the day
client.fn	( y* y* )
-	-
client.r+7	( uh ) yeah because ( i [nvv] ) if i wanna get healthy ( you know if if if i ) if i feel weak at all then i don't want to do it at all
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.gi	so
client.r-7	( i ) i think what prolong this ( i* ) is i eat really well
client.o+7	( you know a* ) and ( um ) because i know i have a drug problem
client.fn	and ( uh ) because i see a lot of people that do the same exact thing i do and they're super skinny ( or or ) or you can see it in their face that they
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+d7	( you know and um ) and ( i don't ) i don't wanna be like that even though ( i ) i can't tell if i look like that at all or nothing
client.r-7	but ( um ) even though i ( do that do ) do that drug ( um i try to uh i ) i work hard at ( trying to ) trying to be somewhat intelligent i guess you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+7	( in c* because i ) in other words i wanna be ready in case somebody hey you know what ( i ) i heard you're a good worker you wanna work with me because ( i don't li* wa* ) i don't want to end up that day saying well i can't ( you know ) ( i gotta ) i gotta find a drug or something
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like that today when you're choosing not to use that it has to do with you wanting to remain healthy and you want to remain intelligent so that if that opportunity for a job should come up you can take it
-	-
client.r+7	i'll be ready yeah
counselor.rec	yeah yeah well those are good strong reasons huh
-	-
client.o+7	they are they are yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	so ( what ) what are the advantages of that for you what
-	-
client.r+7	( um ) in the back of my head i know ( that ) that if i stop this completely i can go right into an interview room ( a* a* ) and get the job
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	wow
client.r+7	( a* ) and i need to work i haven't worked for a couple years i've had a couple of setbacks
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i broke my back ( a* ) and ( um ) going through ( m* ) i don't even want to talk about them but ( uh i was um ) right after i broke my back a month later i broke my leg for the same reason
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( uh ) so i haven't worked for a long time
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so all this idle time i didn't use to my better advantage you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i started drinking ( and and and ) and doing drugs and stuff
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+7	( and ) and ( it messes ) it kinda put a big strain on my relationship with my family ( you know )
counselor.su	wow
client.r+7	( so uh and it ) but it's never too late
client.r+d7	so i wanna end this get healthy ( and uh ) and go out and get a job you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+7	because ( this ) this is the ending of this ( now ) now that i've been clear with my leg and all that
-	-
client.r+7	( um ) i don't have any more visits or anything so it's time to go out and work ( you know )
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	right
client.o+7	so i need to get healthy and ( a* ) hopefully i get directed the right way
client.fn	because i never had like i told you a social worker or case worker ( you know ) ( that ) that has ( has uh ) outlets on where to go to take care of my problem
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	that's what they're for right
-	-
counselor.gi	mm well what we're talking about in this particular study right now is just to see ( what y* ) what you have ( s* ) used ( in ) in your daily life ( to ) as cues to use or to not use and that's one of the things we're looking at right now
counselor.res	when i ask you like today you see health as being very important to you and being sharp and being able to get that job is very important to you
-	-
counselor.rec	it sounds like ( that um ) also meeting with your family and getting back connected with them is very important to you
client.r+7	oh yeah
client.r+7	is very important also
counselor.st	so now let's maybe talk about
counselor.quo	on the days you do use what's going on

counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.gi	well

client.fn	yeah
client.fn	well
counselor.gi	( and ) which is why we're kind of exploring some of
-	-
client.fn	right yeah well see that could go on for an hour i got a lot of things to say

counselor.quc	is that okay with you if we continue
client.fn	well
client.fn	i want to get the big picture on what's going on with it
client.fn	because he was straight from the book ( he ) he ( gave ) gave me questions i answered
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	right here we're having ( like ) a discussion
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i'm not getting upset or nothing ( but ) but ( uh ) i want to get a picture on ( what ) what we're doing
counselor.fa	uh-huh

counselor.quc	( what would you like ) what would you like us to be doing right now
client.fn	well i've already been here an hour
counselor.fa	uh-huh

client.fn	see i don't mind answering none of this but i don't want to go on another hour or hour and a half
counselor.res	so you
counselor.st	well ( i ) i
counselor.st	wasn't planning on going
counselor.st	for an hour
client.fn	but you haven't given no time or nothing see

client.fn	yeah
client.fn	they told me it was gonna be a twenty minute total ( you know )
counselor.st	and it proba*
counselor.fa	yeah

counselor.fa	alright
client.fn	okay see what i'm getting at though ( i you know )
counselor.st	well we can

counselor.quc	so ( you you ) you're feeling like you're all done talking about this now
client.fn	well
-	-
client.fn	( um ) i want a big picture and you still haven't answered that ( on ) on ( how ) what you're gonna do
counselor.gi	we're just gonna talk we're just gonna talk this is what joey asked you
client.fn	( a* ) and
client.fn	what is that
client.fn	uh-huh
counselor.gi	these are some of the things you circled
client.fn	so the purpose
client.fn	( f* ) for ( the ) the visit with you is just to have a conversation and record it
counselor.gi	right
-	-
counselor.gi	uh-huh
client.fn	mm
counselor.quc	is that okay
-	-
client.fn	i'm a little uncomfortable with that right now because this could go on for hours ( you know you just )
counselor.st	no it's probably
client.fn	you just get a little band-aid ( uh ) picture ( on on ) on my addiction really ( you know )
-	-
counselor.st	well ( i'm i i'm ) i'm trying to help you and we're trying to look at ( what ) what are positive reasons for you when you don't use and then again what are things that are going on letting you explore what some of your thoughts on
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	yeah ( i've ) i've gone over this with
-	-
client.fn	many many people ( you know )
counselor.fa	really
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	who have you gone over it with
-	-
client.fn	family family and so-called friends and stuff ( you know )
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	it's not does it ( make ) get you u*
counselor.rec	sounds like it gets you upset talking
client.fn	well wouldn't it get you upset
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) i never met you before okay and ( i'm i'm ) i'm letting you know what all my problems are you know ( and ) and i told you
counselor.fa	uh-huh uh-huh
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.st	okay but again if we could kinda go back and because we looked at ( the things ) the positive things that you see ( when you're ) when you're not using
counselor.af	you've got some really ( s* ) positive strong things that you've told me about when you're not using
client.fn	right
counselor.gi	but i'm not really clear ( what's ) what you're thinking about when you do go out to use
-	-
counselor.quc	( it's ) so ( it ) it does it make you unhealthy
counselor.quo	does it ( you know ) just kind of see what your cues are ( what ) what gets you ( to ) to decide to use
-	-
client.r-7	( um ) i guess it has to do a little bit with anxiety depression ( you know )
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( um ) now this whole incident with my back thing ( and and and uh ) and i have a primary doctor named miss_enzian okay
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.nc	[du]
client.fn	( a* a* ) and she talks clear she makes a lot of sense this and that i don't think she did ( a ) a good job with me at all okay
counselor.fa	really
-	-
client.fn	yeah because i broke my back and ( um ) i needed coverage to take care ( of uh of ) of the bills and she was aware that when i broke my back
client.fn	and she decided to go on vacation which is fine but when you're aware ( that ) that one of your patients something happened like that you should at least sign so i can get the coverage that i need
-	-
client.fn	( i got ) my credit ( is ) is [sound effect] totally totally messed up because ( when the ) when ( uh ) the ambulance takes you ( a* a* ) and you're ( a* at at a ) at a hospital bills start stacking up you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i told them ( right away ) right away can you call miss_enzian ( and ) and have her sign papers so i could get that what is it called g [du] the medical coupon thing
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( and ) and it didn't happen it did not happen
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	okay ( and ) and my back goes out on me from time to time
client.fn	and ( uh ) one of these times ( it ) it went out on me and i fell and i broke my leg because of my back
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and the same thing happened again
client.fn	this time i made it real clear can you please call miss [du] let her know that because she knew ( that uh ) that was collapsing because of my back
client.fn	same thing got a bunch of bills you know
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	it's not her fault it's not her problem but ( i w* ) i was smart enough to think ahead of time ( to to ) to prevent ( um ) these bills being piled up ( and ) and it didn't happen
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yeah [du]
counselor.rec	that sounds like it's pretty frustrating for you
client.fn	it is frustrating yeah
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	so how did you cope with that
-	-
client.fn	( j* ) just coped with it yeah i just coped with it it's all you could do now you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( i g* ) i guess i'm not getting a big picture on what they were gonna do here today ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( um ) i'm shutting down right now because ( um ) i don't wanna discuss with somebody i do not know
client.r+n7	but what i do need to know is see if i can be directed into a way ( where ) where i can maybe prevent the next time i think about using you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and discussing ( doesn't ) does not i'll tell you right now it doesn't work with for me [du]

-	-
counselor.quo	( how ) how would somebody do something about it
counselor.quo	tell me what you mean by that
counselor.gi	because i'm not really clear
counselor.res	i mean you just told me that you really don't know if you want inpatient treatment or if you want any treatment
client.fn	i don't know if i
client.fn	do or not ( what what ) ( you know if i knew ) if i knew what some options were you know
counselor.fa	yeah

client.fn	and i don't mind this
counselor.gi	you
counselor.gi	this is a study again as i said before
client.fn	[du]
counselor.af	and i appreciate you agreeing to it
counselor.st	but part of the study is to kind of work on the questions i ask
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	and he doesn't know what you and i talk about either because it is a study and it has to ( you know ) so ( he ) i'm the interventionist he's the person who helps gather the information and the people who qualify ( um you know ) and ( that's ) that part of it
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	okay
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	okay
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	i guess i'm just a little uneasy just having a conversation about something i've been ( you know )
counselor.gi	oh yeah and i'm not
counselor.gi	really clear what
client.fn	because i've done it many many many many many many many many many times yeah with a lot of different people

client.fn	people that i care about [du] doesn't have to be family [du]
counselor.res	okay so people in your life
counselor.res	and you care about
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	and yet you also told me that you really hadn't talked to anybody about it ( when you fir* ) when we first spoke
counselor.gi	so i'm
-	-
counselor.gi	( you know )
client.fn	what do you guys usually do when if somebody is severe
client.fn	just talk about it or maybe try to resolve it
-	-
counselor.quo	and how do you mean resolve it
-	-
client.r+d7	i don't want this problem anymore
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	but i don't want to talk about it i want to see if we could find some way to just talking about it would
counselor.co	so what you want is a magic something that's going to stop it from happening
client.fn	is it magic that's gonna take care of my problem
counselor.quc	is it
-	-
client.fn	( w* ) i didn't bring up magic you're the one that brought up the word magic okay

counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i thought you did
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	alright
-	-
counselor.ec	( i think ) i think the thing that's gonna take care of it is inside of you and that's what we're trying to explore
client.fn	okay
counselor.ec	you know because nobody is with you twenty_four hours a day it's you and your thoughts
client.fn	okay thanks
counselor.quc	( do ) do you agree or
-	-
client.fn	you're right absolutely right so you think by me talking about it to you it's gonna help

-	-
client.fn	no

client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.fn	( you ) you don't know any one of these that will take me ( like ) right now that can help me huh
client.fn	you haven't called any of these
-	-
counselor.gi	( i you know what ) most of the places want to speak with you directly
counselor.gi	because like i'm talking with you right now ( it's it's ) part of it is is that you're the one who needs the assistance and they want to talk to you directly about what's going on with you and what the problem is
client.fn	right
-	-
client.fn	( s* ) sounds good sounds good but that hasn't happened [du]

client.fn	okay
counselor.af	that's good
-	-
counselor.gi	so [du]
client.fn	okay thank you very much i appreciate it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	so
-	-
counselor.gi	this is all yours if you want it
client.fn	okay
counselor.quc	okay
-	-
client.fn	alright thank you
-	-
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.nc	set it here i guess
counselor.gi	( um ) so i don't know how much they told you about what we would be talking about or
counselor.gi	( um ) i can give you a little background so basically our study is looking at drug use
counselor.st	and ( um ) the purpose today is basically for us to just talk about your drug use
counselor.gi	but you don't need to ( um ) make a change that's not why i'm talking to you
counselor.gi	i'm not trying to drug counseling about abstinence or anything like that
client.fn	right
counselor.gi	so we're really interested in ( you know ) why people use what it means to them things like that
client.fn	okay
counselor.st	( um ) and then we follow up ( and ) and check in on you and how you're doing
counselor.st	but it's more of an informal conversation really focused on ( you know ) what you think about your use so
client.fn	alright
-	-
counselor.gi	( so that
counselor.quo	um ) kinda tell me a little bit about your
counselor.quc	you're using marijuana
-	-
client.r-2	( um ) yes i use medical marijuana because ( um ) when i was born i was born with no thyroid and it causes a whole slew of different ( um ) physical emotional ( uh ) problems
counselor.su	oh
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	( um ) another reason i use medical marijuana ( um ) when i was twenty years old i worked for nasa and i broke my back in four places and pinched off my spinal cord and had massive brain trauma
counselor.af	wow
counselor.su	oh my god
counselor.su	gees
counselor.su	wow
client.fn	and so i feel very fortunate to be alive
counselor.su	yeah
client.r-2	and so in that aspect i think that if using medical marijuana helps take away the pressure in my brain it takes pressure off my spinal cord
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	it helps me eat when i don't really feel like it
counselor.su	gosh
client.r-2	( um ) you know what i'm saying and i have a lot of pain ( like i have um ) i was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in nineteen_ninety_nine and i guess it did some damage even though they can't
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.su	wow
-	-
client.r-2	( you know ) the cancer itself part may be in remission but the damage and the pain and the sickness and everything that that causes is still with me ( i ) i carry that every day
counselor.fa	wow
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
counselor.su	so you've had ( i mean ) a go of it your whole life it sounds like every kinda turn or something happening
-	-
client.fn	yeah it's been pretty rough
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	so i think me using medical marijuana considering what i've been through is more of a godsend than a curse ( or ) or a problem ( you know )
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah so it's never really been for you an issue in your life
client.o-2	( not re* ) nah not really no
counselor.res	yeah and it sounds like ( um )
client.o-2	no
-	-
client.r+2	seen other people ( have more ) have had more of an issue with it than i have
client.r-2	but then they didn't consider at that time then if somebody that they knew and loved was hurting and sick the way that i was that they might have looked on it a little differently if it was somebody that they cared about
counselor.su	oh
-	-
counselor.rec	so you've had other people kinda look at this and say ( um ) this is ( not ) still not okay
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.su	that must be really tough
-	-
client.r+2	it's not easy
client.fn	( you know ) it's like don't you have your own issues that you need to be worrying about ( you know ) that kind of thing [laugh] surely you do [laugh]
counselor.res	uh-huh so you feel like
counselor.rec	alright yeah so you feel like you have to kind of justify this a lot and kind of explain your story ( and ) and your pain ( uh ) it feels kind of like an uphill battle
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	constantly
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+2	yeah and ( it just i i ) sometimes i get tired of ( like ) explaining ( you know ) not to you but to ( like you know ) people that don't really have any business asking me
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like in your experience sometimes when you're using people will come up and be like why are you doing that or what's going on and you have to explain it or
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	is that
counselor.quo	i don't know if you can tell me a little bit more about that
counselor.quo	or how that feels for you
-	-
client.fn	( um it just ) it's ( um ) invasive because if i saw them doing something i wouldn't think that it would be okay for me to just go up in their business and ask them ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	so i think people need to lay off ( you know ) if somebody's not bothering you and they're not talking to you and you don't know them and you see them smoking weed don't bother them you know
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.rec	so you really just want privacy kind of
client.fn	i just wanna be ( left al* you know ) just left to my own devices so to speak
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	because ( i have a lot of ) because of the cancer and everything i have a lot of emotional stuff that i have to work through every day just to get out of bed and function and you know what i mean
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.rec	so you've been feeling pretty depressed it sounds like
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	and that's one of the reasons i smoke ( um ) medical marijuana too is because it helps with depression
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	i'm an artist and a poet and a writer
counselor.fa	right
client.r-2	and so on days when i'm in a lot of pain like today and i have stuff ( like ) i had to do like i had to come to the doctor this morning and no matter how much pain or sick i might be yeah i still gotta get up and i still get dressed and i still gotta get on the bus and i still ( you know )
counselor.fa	right
counselor.rec	right you have to go
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	right so this has been not just ( um ) something to help you with the pain or really just to get through every day kinda getting motivated ( and ) and getting out ( um ) things like that
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r-2	exactly
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like ( you um ) even just to get out of the house sometimes ( have to ) you feel like you need to smoke to do that oh
client.r-n2	oh yeah ( because like )
client.r-2	yeah ( because i i go i just ) i guess because i'm in a lot of pain that little things aggravate me ( you know ) it's like stupid little things like somebody kicking me when they get on the bus and that kind of stuff
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	huh uh-huh
-	-
counselor.su	yeah that sounds aggravating
-	-
client.r-2	well it's just ( you know i just it makes me when i ) when i smoke before i leave home it makes me be able to put up with that more
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.rec	so this is kind of like for emotional regulation
counselor.rec	you feel like
client.r-2	yeah and emotionally basically keeps me emotionally stable
-	-
counselor.rec	and it sounds like specifically ( with ) with anger too that it kinda helps you to chill out or
client.r-2	yeah it does
counselor.rec	[du]
client.r-2	yeah because being in pain a lot does cause ( some some ) some issues like that and ( um )
counselor.su	i can imagine
counselor.su	yeah
counselor.su	you've got a lot to be angry about
client.fn	so
-	-
client.fn	( s* ) yeah ( i'm just ) i'm not sure i used to be angry at god for ( you know like ) because i know what the other children ( like ) that grew up with cancer and stuff and it's like i know what they're going through
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know ) and it's like ( it ) it made me ( i'm a c* uh ) i believe in god so as a christian it was hard for me really testing my faith because how can a god that i'm supposed to love and serve allow this kind of pain and suffering to go on
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right
counselor.rec	right so it kind of brought up some big questions for you
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	( it it it ) it hurt
counselor.su	yeah i can imagine
client.fn	( you know )
counselor.rec	that's also really difficult smoking being in the christian community
-	-
client.fn	( um they're um i'm kinda ) i'm going to a church up in shoreline right now
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	and ( they're kind of um ) they have had some members in the past that used medical marijuana ( and ) but ( um ) i guess they kept it hidden
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	well i'm tired of hiding i'm tired of ( you know ) some kids used to have to fake being sick to get out of school well i used to have to fake being well so i could go to school
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	right
counselor.res	the reverse
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
-	-
client.fn	so i couldn't spend time with my friends ( and ) and do stuff because my parents were really worried about me so i had to stay home a lot
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.su	oh gosh
client.fn	you know what i'm saying i wasn't allowed to go out and participate in all of this stuff that
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	wow so your whole life has been affected by this
client.fn	all the
client.fn	( you know )
client.fn	( and i ) and ( i did ) i even went against my parents' wishes and i played football in school and i ran track
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i think the reason i did that it helped get rid of the anger
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah yeah kind of an outlet for you and also kinda feeling like another normal kid
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( i* ) totally yeah i just wanted to fit in i didn't wanna be the freak ( or the ) the kid that ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah right yeah
counselor.su	it makes sense
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	so you kinda took a risk ( um ) for your health ( to ) to be able ( to ) to fit in and to ( um ) feel normal
client.fn	oh absolutely
client.fn	yes and i still do
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.gi	so
client.fn	( i ) i still find myself in that position where i'm having to do stuff and not really tell anybody that ( i'm ) there's anything wrong with me because then they look at you funny
-	-
counselor.rec	right so you feel like you're always hiding
client.fn	or ( like )
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( or that ) or if you tell them there's anything wrong with you they're like oh i guess maybe you're not capable of doing this or that so i'm just not gonna not consider you for this or that ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.rec	so you feel like you have a lot to kind of ( um ) hold back ( and ) and not let people know about to try to prove that you're okay and you want to participate and and it sounds like that at church too that there are other people that were kinda hiding their medical marijuana but ( you're ) you're tired of that
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yes and i'm kinda breaking them in to letting them know that it's okay to be sick
counselor.su	mm yeah
client.fn	that ( um ) i don't like it ( you know ) ( and it's like i'm ) and since i'm the one that's sick i'm the one that should be worried about what kind of treatments and stuff i'm taking for my personal illness
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	you need not concern yourself with whatever is going on like i said before ( it's like ) i think you got enough issues ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.ec	yeah so you're really trying to kind of have personal control over your health
counselor.rec	and ( like ) people might be judging your choice around marijuana use especially in the church
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	definitely and then some people there is totally okay with it
counselor.gi	( um )
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( beca* ) and i think ( um ) can i just be open with you
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( um i ) i'm a songwriter too and i wrote a song for my church and ( um people were ) some people really liked it and stuff
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	and i did that before i let them know that i was sick because in the past i've had problems where i let people know ( that there was you know ) that i had issues or whatever
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	uh-huh uh-huh
client.fn	and then ( i wasn't allowed to par* they didn't then ) i was shunned away and wasn't allowed to participate in the regular stuff you know what i'm saying just outcast because i wasn't well
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	and i notice society does that a lot to people
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah they kinda push you away or they expect less from you
client.fn	yeah oh totally yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah they just really well if there's something wrong with him i'd just really rather not be around him ( you know )
counselor.su	oh yeah that's tough
-	-
client.fn	and that's pretty much
counselor.res	so you did the song first because you didn't wanna experience that
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( i wanted to get ) i wanted a chance for them to get to know me as me and what i was capable of providing or helping with before they knew i had issues
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	right so you did that and then you told them
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	and then ( how ) what happened
-	-
client.fn	it blew them away [laugh]
counselor.res	yeah it sounds like they really liked it
client.fn	because they
-	-
client.fn	well ( they ) they said that it was testing their faith because they weren't sure how to take me
counselor.fa	hmm
client.fn	because here in one aspect i'm an excellent songwriter and encourager for our faith
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but then on the other hand here i am using this drug that a lot of people say oh it's bad for you there's no benefits to drug use of any kind
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.o-2	and ( i just ) i just don't believe that
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	right so it's testing their faith but for you you never felt ( that ) that way yeah
client.fn	you know
client.o-2	no no no
client.r-2	in fact it was the total opposite i felt that ( um ) marijuana was ( like ) a godsend
counselor.fa	right
counselor.res	like you said yeah
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) because when i was like ( i s* ) first time i smoked i was five
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i was really sick ( um ) i went home from the hospital and they told my parents that i was gonna die
counselor.fa	mm-hmm yeah
counselor.su	oh my god
client.fn	and i had been going through that for all my life i guess
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
client.fn	and so each time that i went to the hospital and had to stay for three or four days to get checked out and then they sent me home with no cure no medicine to help my nausea ( no ) ( no no ) nothing to help my depression nothing to give me energy nothing nothing
counselor.fa	ahh
counselor.res	nothing
client.fn	( you know ) they sent me home with nothing oh i'm sorry that your child is gonna die kinda thing just take him home that kinda thing you know
counselor.su	ahh
counselor.su	that's horrible
-	-
counselor.rec	i'm sure you and your family were just devastated
client.fn	and
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( it wasn't and and ) and the medical bills they just piled up and it ( uh ) put a lot of pressure on my family
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm so marijuana was kind of a way to save your family in a way
client.fn	( um )
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( a* ) and then again it was ( the ) the state where i grew up they used it to tear my family apart
-	-
counselor.quo	oh what happened
client.fn	because even though i was sick ( they didn't ) the law enforcement officers they didn't care
counselor.fa	oh
counselor.su	wow
client.fn	it's like they had this it's just like i said it's like how society says well if you're sick we don't really want you
-	-
counselor.res	right so you had an experience in your family where the marijuana they actually took it to be [du]
client.fn	( you know ) we don't
client.fn	oh yeah my family
client.fn	yeah they raided my house when i was a kid
counselor.su	oh my god
client.fn	[laugh] took my parents to jail and took me and my sister to a foster home and stuff
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	and so yeah it was not a pleasant experience
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.rec	so this is ( like ) a huge deal the legalization of marijuana for you because that would have saved ( your ) your family a lot of pain
client.fn	yes it would have ( a lot )
-	-
client.fn	a lot of pain and heartache and legal fees and all kinds of other stuff that ( you know )
counselor.su	oh my god
client.fn	and ( i feel ) grew up in texas and ( i ) i grew up right down the road from the bush family seriously
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.su	oh no
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	and so ( all of their they ) they used to really ( um ) barbara_bush never bothered me but all the guys really did
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and she kinda bothered me in way too because ( it ) you know how the mother figure usually ( um ) preempts what ( the ) the male children what type of behavior they have ( um ) depends on i guess how much love from their mother they get
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) and not just the fatherly discipline stuff but the compassion side of guys or whatever usually comes from their mother
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	right
counselor.res	yeah they need both
counselor.res	that love and the
client.fn	and they didn't have it
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	and ( uh ) so they started making all these stupid rules and laws around where we lived at that hurt people and it benefited them greatly but it hurt everybody else
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	and it really ticked me off because i knew ( their ) they have a younger brother that they don't really talk about a lot but ( he's a ) he's probably four years older than me but we used to hang out and smoke weed when we were kids
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	we lived on a farm we grew up in a farming area you know what i'm saying we rode horses we ( you know ) did that kinda stuff and we smoked grass ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and it
counselor.rec	so it felt ( you know ) like a thing that brought you guys together it was a bonding experience
client.fn	it was a yeah it was
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( and ) and because of that ( his ) he was ( like ) the black sheep of the family
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	that's why they never talk about him on the media or nothing like that he's like the black sheep of the family you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	oh
counselor.fa	geez
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	( let's not ) let's not ever mention him and maybe nobody will bring it up
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	which they got it ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	nobody beside people like me that even know that there is a little brother that's in and out of rehab and that kinda thing you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	right
counselor.rec	so it kind of helps you to feel a little bit better to know that there are ( you know ) people ( like ) even in the president that have problems like ( you know ) every other person but in texas it sounds like they legally kind of attacked people like that huh but for you it felt like
client.fn	yes
client.fn	yes
client.fn	for
-	-
client.fn	their own benefit
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	because ( they made ) they made monetarily funds ( from the ) from the federal d_e_a program to enforce the marijuana laws in texas
counselor.fa	yeah gees
client.fn	they didn't care if you were sick and ( you know i ) i just
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah wow so you've had ( a i mean ) an incredible life story and a long relationship with the marijuana that sounds like it really saved you from pain and then you also have some mixed feelings about what happened
client.r-2	i think i'm still alive because of it
counselor.su	wow
client.fn	because ( um ) i guess you can only ( um ) i felt bad for ( like ) that doctor_kevorkian guy because i know in some aspects he was really weird but in some aspects he was really trying to help these people that didn't see any ( of the ) other way out ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	because they were sick i mean they knew they were dying anyway ( it's like ) and they didn't wanna suffer anymore and i've been there
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.res	right so you have
counselor.rec	yeah you've been there and you really have a handle on kind of the ethical
counselor.gi	there's a lot of ethical questions that come up ( with ) with drug use
counselor.rec	and you kind of have been on the side of someone that's really benefited from this
counselor.quo	( um ) so going forward ( you know ) what do you want ( um ) to have your life look like in your relationship with marijuana and with how it is in your life and with other people
-	-
client.r-d2	i want to be able to have a place where i can grow my own medicine and so i ( begger ) better regulate what i get when i get it how i get it and that kind of thing and i'm working on that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( um i had an ) i'm about to lose my apartment my landlord is selling the house that i live in and my apartment is ( like ) in the house and so i have until the end of november to get out
counselor.su	oh gees
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.su	gees
-	-
client.fn	and so on top of being sick and stressed out i now have ( the ) the probability of not having a home at the end of the month ( you know ) because i have low finances ( i ) i get s_s_i disability every month ( um ) i get food stamps and stuff but ( it's ) it barely covers stuff you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( just that i i think ) i think in order for ( our ) our country as a whole to get back to being like a grassroots kind of country and supporting each other is lay off the people that are sick give the people that are sick more resources so they don't have to be so sick
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( like ) giving somebody enough food stamps to barely feed them when you know that one of their disabilities is ( like ) a eating disorder or they don't eat enough they're ( maltrition* ) malnutritioned or whatever and you're not giving these people enough ( to satisf* or ) to help them ( you know and ) and sometimes they're just making their condition worse
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	because a lot of people i know not me personally but a lot of my friends ( have said have s* um ) they used to ( like ) sell their food stamps and stuff because the food stamp office didn't give them enough to satisfy a need but if they were to take that and transfer that over for cash for something then they were able to pay their light bill
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm yeah
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) and i'm just tired of our government putting people in a position where they have to do that kinda stuff
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.gi	yeah so in the future
client.fn	( stop ) stop
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	claiming that people are frauding the system when you all are setting it up to be frauded
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah i mean it sounds like you have the experience and the knowledge about what would help the system kind of from your first hand experience
client.fn	definitely
counselor.rec	( um ) and in the future for you it sounds like you'd like a safe place to live ( um ) and you want to grow your own so that you know what you're getting
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	so right now are you getting it from dispensaries or
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	yes
counselor.res	but you'd still like more control over kind of what exactly you're getting and how that looks
client.fn	right
counselor.rec	( um ) and then it sounds like you're gonna be working with your group at your church to kind of work on this acceptance and understanding around ( you know ) how you've been in this world and how marijuana fits in
-	-
client.fn	( and ) and i'm working on that ( um i just ) i recently asked them they have ( like ) a benevolence fund that's been set up through the church and they know that i'm on disability and i'm barely making it and stuff like that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( um ) i told them that ( i'm ) i had money to cover my rent and my bus pass and all the bills that i incur every month but when i get done paying that i'm broke
-	-
client.r+2	and the dispensaries don't exactly wanna give out the medicine you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	oh right
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+2	every now and then you might find one that'll help somebody out a little bit yeah ( not ) not enough to make a significant difference in a person's life
counselor.res	yeah but not
counselor.res	really enough
counselor.fa	right
client.r-d2	and i want to be able to do that for other patients i wanna be able to grow enough
client.fn	because ( these ) some of these dispensaries around here are really greedy i mean ( they ) the prices are so extravagant and the ( just it's really ) it's not a good situation and they don't really help people
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	right so you wanna set up some sort of cooperative where people that have serious disabilities or are sick can come and not have to pay those prices
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o-2	in fact instead of ( like um ) it's like ten dollars for ( like ) a gram of medicine i wanna make it like two dollars you know what i'm saying
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.res	wow well
counselor.rec	yeah it sounds like ( you have kind of a ) you've kind of turned your life experiences that other people have judged or been really difficult it sounds like you're turning it into something really positive [du] around and giving back to other people you just need to get the pieces in place to do that
client.fn	i'm wanting to
client.fn	it's good
-	-
client.o-2	yeah ( i'm i'm i'm ) i need to get a license to where i can distribute and help people and not just have one for myself
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm hmm
client.r+2	( you know um ) i talked to my mom she lives in florida she's really worried about the whole situation ( you know ) because of what happened ( when ) when i was younger
counselor.su	oh yeah
client.r+2	( you know ) she's like i don't wanna see you go through what we went through kinda thing ( you know and it's ) because ( it's ) you remember how ugly it all was
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.res	yeah so she's worried for you [du] involved in any legal issues
client.fn	( you know )
client.fn	she ( uh )
client.r+2	exactly
client.fn	and i told her well stop worrying about me so i won't worry about it so much
client.r+2	because ( you know ) ( it's like ) if you had somebody really worrying about you and then ( your ) part of your brain is gonna be always on that mindset that ( you know ) never be able to truly get away from that worry
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	right so it sounds like when you're gonna do this you're make sure you do it in the most legal way possible so something like that doesn't happen to you
client.fn	oh
client.fn	definitely
-	-
client.fn	and then i have other issues where ( um i* ) being on disability they don't want me ( they ) they figure
counselor.rec	can't
counselor.rec	really make money or yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and so i'm thinking that ( um ) i can set up ( it's like a ) a lot of these dispensaries and stuff say that they're for profit
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-2	well i want mine to be ( like ) not for profit ( a truly ) a true not for profit and not a corporation that just says oh yeah we're not for profit but yeah we don't help anybody either
counselor.fa	mm yeah
counselor.res	like a non profit
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	yeah yeah cool
client.fn	( you know )
counselor.st	well that's about the amount of time we have
client.fn	okay
counselor.quc	is there
client.fn	i'm sorry ( um ) i hope i ( didn't say i* ) didn't ( um ) waste it on stuff that wasn't important
-	-
counselor.st	oh no ( i ) i didn't mean to i mean we all just end ( you know ) whenever
counselor.af	but ( i ) i really appreciated hearing your perspective today
counselor.gi	i think ( uh ) a lot of people that that use marijuana ( you know ) they have different reasons for doing it
counselor.rec	and just hearing your story it sounds like you really have an inspiration on how you want ( to ) this to look for you in the future
-	-
counselor.su	and you've been through a lot of pain that this has helped so it's understandable where you're at

client.fn	yeah [du]
counselor.gi	and moderate's so it's a little higher than you were thinking

-	-
client.fn	yeah i thought it was ( like ) moderate i thought i was ( you know )
client.o+7	i guess an addicted person think they're in control or something i don't know yeah you think you [du] you find out that you're at the bottom of the [du] [laugh]
counselor.nc	[laugh]

counselor.res	and ( uh ) so i heard you say some things like being an addict
counselor.quo	so tell me more about that
counselor.quo	what's that

client.r-7	it's like ( you know ) you're at the top of the world sometimes
client.r+7	and the bottom of the world most of the time [du]
client.r-7	i don't know you think you can ( uh ) manipulate their way through life or whatever
client.r+7	and you think sometimes you get high and you reflect on your life what the hell wrong with me [du]
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	so i'm hearing ( like y* ) when you're high and you're kind of cruising along you don't really think about it you just sort of cruise ( and ) and every once in a while something pops up like this where you go oh gees ( you know )

client.fn	( uh ) i'm living on ( uh ) s_s_i for depression ( you know ) just [du] in and out of jails all my life
client.r+7	it really never clicked for me that every time i got in trouble i was under the influence of something it's rare that i misbehave when i was behaving
-	-
client.fn	[du]
counselor.rec	wow so ( you ) you're saying that when you get high you get in trouble
-	-
client.r+7	right yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	and it is just starting to click that after all these years you've been ( feeli* ) feeling kind of depressed and whatever these getting in trouble but then now you're looking at it a* i don't know how old you are but now you look at it as like gees every time ( i ) i got in trouble i was using
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+7	right mm-hmm and that's a very true statement [du]
counselor.fa	wow
counselor.fa	wow
client.r+7	i don't think i ever got in trouble when i was sober ( you know ) nothing ever bothered me ( you know i ) i could control it
client.o+7	( you know ) thinking of ways to improve my life [du]
-	-
counselor.rec	so when you're sober you think about goals
-	-
client.fn	yes yeah it's goals [du]
-	-
counselor.rec	uh-huh things you wanna do and then when you're cruising ( you ) on drugs you're sort of thinking about just
client.fn	yeah

counselor.res	what
client.r+7	need some more drugs
client.fn	[du]
counselor.res	yeah get more drugs sort of
counselor.rec	and then also boom you're in trouble and bam get thrown in jail or ( you know ) get hurt

client.r+n7	i need help [laugh] that's what i need yes i need help i need to stop ( i need to ) i need to do a lot of things ( you know ) but i definitely need some help
client.o+7	( you know ) i'm really beginning to review my [du]
counselor.res	so you think
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.quc	so tell me how important is it for you to change ( uh ) your drug use ( uh ) in terms of ( like ) one to ten
-	-
client.o+7	i would say nine
-	-
counselor.res	nine
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	why isn't it like six or four
-	-
client.r+7	because i'm one of the people that ( i ) like i said i reflect on my life and every time i got in trouble i was using ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+d7	i would like to one day not use anything ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+7	[du] ( you know ) types of normal ambitions learning new things or something or doing new things ( you know )
client.r+7	because really i think getting high ( like ) replaces valuable time that we you should be trying to do something and you just lay around getting loaded all day and sitting around not changing [du] and stuff to do
counselor.res	so that
-	-
counselor.res	so yeah it takes away from all those goals you were talking about you wanna do yeah cool
client.r+7	right right yeah
counselor.quc	how confident are you from one to ten that you could make this change
-	-
client.r+a7	i think like about a eight or nine yes
client.r+d	( you know ) because i really wanna change
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-7	( you know if you know ) it's just my circumstances in life has me dealing with a certain type of people all the time
client.r-a1	and i can't go in a bar and not have a drink
client.fn	( you know ) some people can ( you know ) [du]
-	-
counselor.rec	( s* ) so by living the way you're living you keep running in you get triggers
client.r-7	yeah it triggers [du] yeah i get
client.r-7	triggers all the time ( you know ) and stuff just from the life that i live ( you know ) so
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm so it sounds like ( y* ) your number is really ( l* ) high up there confident and you're ( like ) way up there at the top that you can make a change
-	-
client.o+7	yes i believe in myself
counselor.quc	the only
-	-
counselor.quc	thing that you're saying is that it's ( um ) lifestyle
-	-
counselor.nc	[du]
client.fn	no in any addiction
client.r-7	the addiction is there ( you know ) because when i get depressed i self-medicate basically
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

client.fn	( like ) chronically depressed all my life ( you know ) and stuff i was getting in trouble even as a child ( you know ) and stuff [du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and having problems dealing with people and things ( and ) and not care about other people's feelings and things and stuff
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r+7	( you know and ) and i'm getting pretty old and i don't wanna ( you know ) spend all these years and never accomplish anything ( you know ) and stuff
client.fn	and the end is a complete mess
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	the what
-	-
client.fn	in the end i was a complete mess and stuff
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+	( you know ) like uh if life ended today and stuff i'd feel it's [du] wasted [du] and stuff there's nothing positive to think or reflect upon anything ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.af	you sound like a pretty reflective guy
-	-
counselor.res	but ( when you're ) when you're [du]
client.fn	yeah it's just it's just i get in moods and stuff ( you know ) i
counselor.rec	but ( whe* ) i'm
counselor.rec	hearing you really thinking about a lot of things ( when ) like your goals that you know you have goals when you're clean sober and you know that when you get high you get in trouble and some scary stuff has happened

counselor.adw	there's ( you know ) well or no change you could leave it the way it is
counselor.adw	or you could ( um ) completely stop abstain
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.adw	( um ) you could choose not to you know those places where you got in trouble and make sure if you're gonna use and get high make sure that you're doing something in a place where you'll not get in trouble
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.adw	( you know ) like not go to that bar where you know that so-and-so is always there and every time you get high you guys get into it
client.fn	right
counselor.adw	( you know like ) eliminating those things you [du] stay safe ( you know ) or don't drive or don't operate machinery [laugh] ( or ) or things like that you know [du]
client.fn	yeah

-	-
counselor.af	and ( i you know ) i think you can do it

counselor.quo	okay well ( tell me about ) tell me about that
counselor.quo	tell me about your use
-	-
client.r-d2	i just like smoking weed
client.o-1	and just have a couple of beers after work
client.o-1	i don't do it to get a drunk drunk i don't do it to get wasted
client.fn	i do you know like to have a couple of beers after work that's about it
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.o-2	the same way as pot i don't abuse it
-	-
counselor.quc	okay and so do you use weed and alcohol then every day
-	-
client.fn	uh yes and no
client.fn	sometimes i go without it sometimes i don't
client.fn	it depends on what mood i'm in
-	-
counselor.quc	okay can you give me an example of when you do use it
counselor.quc	and then when you don't use it
-	-
client.fn	like if i don't have any i don't use it
client.fn	but if i do have some i still use it
client.fn	and then if i still have it and i don't want it i just don't i won't use it
-	-
counselor.quc	okay you said it depends on your mood right
-	-
client.fn	it depends on my mood
client.r-1	if i'm in a very good good mood and all that i can usually have a couple of beers and smoke some weed
client.r-1	if i'm in a bad mood i do the same thing
-	-
counselor.res	okay so even if you're both in a bad mood and good mood you use it you use it anyways
client.fn	bad mood and good mood i still do it yes
-	-
counselor.res	okay because you said earlier that it depends on how you feel the amount that you use and how long you use
client.fn	yeah you use
-	-
client.fn	it depends on how i feel too
client.fn	like i can be in a good mood and still use it
client.fn	i can be in a bad mood and still use it
client.fn	i can be in a really yeah a shitty mood and i still use it
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so it sounds like you pretty much use it then no matter how you're feeling good or bad or in between
client.fn	good or bad no matter what
-	-
counselor.rec	you use it anyways
-	-
client.r-d1	yes ( it's my personal ) it's ( my personal ) my personal preference to do that
client.fn	and like uh i don't do any other drugs and all that
client.fn	i mean i used to but then a long time ago and that's almost thirty years
client.fn	so i don't consider that a you know
counselor.quo	what were you using back then
-	-
client.fn	um some coke and all that
-	-
counselor.res	so you say you've stopped you've been sober from clean and sober from coke for at least thirty years
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	wow
counselor.quo	boy what was that like using it back then
-	-
client.fn	well i'd try it so i'd use it
client.fn	i liked it so i just continued trying it
client.fn	and then i just stopped
-	-
counselor.quo	so yeah what was it that made you stop
-	-
client.r+d3	didn't want it anymore
-	-
counselor.quc	okay did you
counselor.quo	how did you do that
-	-
client.fn	just gave it up
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	all my friends used it they did it around me
client.fn	every time they offered me i told them no
-	-
counselor.quc	okay um so did coke in any way interfere with your life
-	-
client.fn	nope
-	-
counselor.quc	okay do you feel that using pot and drinking do you think that interferes at all with your life
client.o-1	nope
counselor.quo	well what do you see are some of the good things about using and some of the bad things
counselor.quc	say if you were to pick ( one ) one between alcohol and marijuana which one would you be using
-	-
client.fn	pot
-	-
counselor.quc	okay so ( with ) with pot
client.fn	well actually
-	-
client.fn	actually i'd be using both
client.fn	i won't i just won't pick one
-	-
counselor.quc	do you have a preference as to one
-	-
client.fn	pot
-	-
counselor.quo	okay so what do you see are some good things about using pot
counselor.quo	and what are some ( bad things ) bad negative things about using pot
-	-
client.r+2	negative hmm the only thing negative about using pot is having to pay for it [laugh]
-	-
counselor.quc	okay okay um-hmm that's not cheap right
client.fn	you know this
-	-
client.r+2	no
-	-
counselor.quc	okay and do you see any other negative
-	-
client.fn	negative about that
-	-
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
client.o-2	i don't actually no not really
client.r-2	because it kind of mellows me out a little bit so
-	-
counselor.quo	well tell me about the good things
-	-
client.r-2	good things it just calms my nerves down a little bit
client.r-2	i can be uptight frustrated just smoke a bowl and it calms me down a little bit
-	-
counselor.res	so it helps relaxes you and makes you feel better
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.rec	okay so on the one hand you're saying that
-	-
client.o+2	um that's not a good reason to use it
client.r-2	but it does mellow me out a little bit
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+2	i'm not saying it's good to use it like that for that but
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so on one hand you're saying that you know on the positive side of using pot it calms your nerves and sort of makes you more even ) even mood right
client.fn	um-hum
-	-
client.fn	um-hum
-	-
counselor.rec	what you're saying is you don't really think that should be a good enough reason to be using marijuana and then on the negative side it's pretty costly
client.o+2	probably not
counselor.rec	you know well it sounds like it's important for you to use though
-	-
client.fn	um no not really
client.o-2	it's not it's i can take it or leave it any way i want
-	-
counselor.quo	okay so if you were able to leave it you know what would that look like
-	-
client.fn	if i have to leave it if it depe*
client.o+2	i'd say put it this way if i had a job that's saying they're going to ua me and all that i would stop
-	-
counselor.res	okay so you okay so you would stop if your for example your employer is gonna is gonna ua you
client.o+2	i would just completely stop
client.o+2	if they decide to ua everybody then yeah
counselor.quc	so you would stop because you now that there's a risk right and being found out
-	-
client.o-2	i really don't care if anybody knows that i'm doing it just as long as i don't do it at work just as long as i don't do it where the bosses are at
-	-
counselor.af	okay well that's good i'm glad to hear that you're at work and you know you care about your job
counselor.af	( that ) that's a big thing
counselor.af	and that you don't you're not using when you're at work
counselor.quo	what do you do for a living
-	-
client.fn	i'm a detailer i detail cars
-	-
counselor.quc	okay do you like your job
-	-
client.fn	yes i like detailing cars yes
-	-
counselor.af	okay yeah great great it's good to hear it
counselor.rec	it sounds like it's really important to your job is
counselor.rec	because you're not using when you're there and you care about what happens to you right but you're also saying on the other hand you really don't care if anyone else
client.fn	um-hum
-	-
client.r-2	i don't care what anybody else thinks that i'm using pot
counselor.gi	i thought so
-	-
counselor.rec	so keeping your job ( is ) is
-	-
client.fn	keeping my job is number one
-	-
counselor.quc	okay okay all right so at this point on a scale of one_to_ten
counselor.gi	ten is the highest
counselor.quc	how important is it for you to continue using
-	-
client.fn	i'd go five
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	half
-	-
counselor.quc	( can you tell me ) can you tell me more about that
counselor.quo	why would it be half
-	-
client.fn	why would it be half
-	-
counselor.gi	um-hum
-	-
client.r-d2	because i like it
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.o-2	and until the day i either die or until i got forced to quit then i will quit
-	-
counselor.res	so if you were
counselor.quo	what things would force you to quit you think
-	-
client.o+2	ua ( getting a new job ) getting a new job
client.o+2	if i was to get fired from this one just stuff like that
-	-
counselor.quc	okay so a lot of it really has to do with your ability to earn money right
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.rec	and income
counselor.quc	is that right
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	okay how do you think using pot is linked to your health
-	-
client.fn	i really don't know man
-	-
counselor.gi	you're being seen at family medicine clinic
counselor.quo	what brought you into the clinic today
-	-
client.fn	oh my back
-	-
counselor.res	your back
counselor.quc	okay okay so how long have you had back problems
-	-
client.fn	uh off and on about a couple of years
-	-
counselor.quc	okay did you get that from an injury or
-	-
client.fn	um i think solely in um just doing stuff that lifting wrong and all that crap
-	-
counselor.res	okay so it's been a couple years since your back ( was hurt ) started hurting and it comes on and off
counselor.quc	do you take anything for that
counselor.quo	what's your doctor say about it
-	-
client.fn	um i got some muscle relaxers now that i'm supposed to get filled up and all that
client.fn	and i got some kind of little painkillers for it too
-	-
counselor.quo	okay okay so you what do you think about marijuana and your back issue
counselor.quc	do you think they're linked at all your marijuana and [du]
client.fn	man i don't think so
counselor.quc	okay you said earlier that the marijuana sort of relaxes you right
counselor.res	puts you in a better or an even more mood
client.fn	um-hum
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	does it help too with the muscle-relaxing piece of it
-	-
client.fn	um sometimes it does and sometimes it don't
client.fn	it depends
-	-
counselor.quo	on what
-	-
client.fn	on anything and everything
client.fn	i mean i can just be chilling right here and right now i get a real sharp pain in my back so
-	-
counselor.quc	um-hum well do you have any other health problems
-	-
client.fn	no i'm pretty much healthy besides my back and all that
client.fn	i mean i got allergies and i've got you know asthma and all the other good stuff
-	-
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
client.fn	which i've never had when i was little so
-	-
counselor.res	so you said you have asthma
counselor.quc	okay so you see a doctor for that
-	-
client.fn	no i've got an inhaler it's
-	-
counselor.res	oh you do have an inhaler okay
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah but see i've never had asthma when i was little
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah some people develop it when they become adults
client.fn	and i
-	-
client.fn	i thought asthma was only for little kids
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah no you can get it as an adult too
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	so do you see a link at all with using marijuana and having asthma
-	-
client.fn	no not really
-	-
counselor.quc	okay well can i share with you what i know about that
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.quc	well you know cigarettes are not good for you right
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	smoking at all is not good for you
counselor.gi	but i believe that with marijuana the impact on your lungs and respiratory is much more worse than smoking cigarettes so that will affect how you breathe
counselor.gi	so if you want to know more about that you can talk to your doctor too
counselor.gi	i mean ( they're always ) they're always there
client.fn	yeah
counselor.su	and i hope you have a relationship with your doctor
-	-
client.fn	oh i tell her stuff that i normally won't tell nobody else
-	-
counselor.quo	okay so mister_garcia if the time were right
counselor.res	right now you're saying that you're fifty_fifty between quitting and not quitting
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.quo	um what would you do
counselor.quo	if the time were right to stop using what would you do
counselor.quo	what would that look like
-	-
client.fn	it depends on the circumstance
client.o+2	if somebody was to offer me let's say a hundred_dollars a job that requires a lot of you know yeah i'd quit right there and then
-	-
counselor.res	okay so it would take um
client.fn	but it
-	-
client.fn	would have to be something that i wanted to do something that people cannot make me do
-	-
counselor.quc	okay so unless they were your employer right
counselor.rec	unless you feel like it would be too risky depending on the good jobs and [du]
client.o+2	if i thought it would be too risky to continue smoking pot then i'd quit
counselor.gi	okay and then that brings back again to your ideal or how much you value your job as an important part of your life
counselor.quc	is that right
-	-
client.fn	um-hum
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r-2	so ( right now ) right now i could still smoke and still do my work see
counselor.fa	okay
client.o-2	but i don't do it at work and ( i don't ) i don't carry that stuff with me
-	-
counselor.quc	okay so it sounds like you're really cautious about making sure you're not caught right
client.fn	yes i am very cautious about that
client.r+2	especially at the workplace
counselor.res	okay okay so
client.o-2	any other place i won't care
-	-
counselor.res	okay so ( the legal ) the legal possibilities concerns you if you were to get caught
client.r+2	at my work
-	-
client.r+2	at my work
client.r-2	anywhere else no
client.r-2	what are they going to do just take it away and slap my hand and give me a two_hundred_fifty_dollar fine
counselor.quc	have you
client.fn	yes i've already
counselor.res	it sounds like you have you been there before
-	-
counselor.fa	[laugh] okay okay so
-	-
client.o-2	and no i haven't learned my lesson
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and that was going to be your next question
-	-
counselor.res	[laugh] okay well yeah right i mean you haven't learned your lesson as you say in your own words
client.fn	i'm being honest
counselor.quc	because you still use it right
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.res	and you're still talking about not caring unless it's job related
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.quc	okay well how many times were you busted i guess in the past
-	-
client.fn	um walking down the street so i'd say about twice
-	-
counselor.res	two times okay
counselor.quo	and what happened then
client.o-2	that's only been that's only because i was smoking a joint on the street so
-	-
counselor.res	okay so you were smoking pot both times
-	-
client.fn	um-hum
-	-
counselor.res	in public
counselor.quc	were you arrested
-	-
client.fn	no they just took it away from me and told me i got to go to court so
-	-
counselor.quc	and did you end up going to court
-	-
client.fn	yeah i went to court and all that
-	-
counselor.quo	what happened there
-	-
client.fn	they dismissed one of the charges because they didn't have nothing because somehow it got lost
client.fn	which i don't think it got lost i think the cop smoked it all [laugh]
-	-
counselor.res	okay so one of the cases got dismissed
counselor.quo	what about the other one
-	-
client.fn	the other one i just had to pay spend the day in jail and pay two_hundred_fifty_dollar fine which i hadn't even paid that
client.fn	they just let it go on that i just stayed my day in jail and that's it
-	-
counselor.quc	okay does it concern you at all worry at all if say a third time happens and
-	-
client.o-2	not really
counselor.quc	and there's more
-	-
client.fn	it's been
-	-
counselor.quc	( of a ) of repercussions
client.o-2	the last two times i got
-	-
client.o-2	i got caught with that has been over two years ago so
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	not really
-	-
counselor.res	okay two years ago was the last time
-	-
client.o-2	yeah ( i really ) it really don't faze me one bit
client.fn	i mean some people might think i'm negative like that but i'm just being honest
-	-
counselor.af	um-hmm honesty is good and you've surely been honest with me today
counselor.af	so ( i do ) i do ( appreciate ) appreciate that
counselor.rec	okay so at this point the way i see it then is that you're kind of thinking about changing or ( stopping ) stopping using but you're feeling that unless it impacts your job you're not going to stop
counselor.quc	did i get that right
-	-
client.fn	yup
-	-
counselor.res	okay and you're also concerned about
client.o-2	i only
-	-
client.o-2	got two bad habits
client.o-2	and i'm going to keep them until the day i die
client.o+2	or ( until some ) until i get a better job or something like that
client.fn	whichever comes first [laugh]
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like the job thing is always a goal that you're looking at you'd like to get a better job
client.fn	that's that's my number one priority right now is not to
counselor.quc	are you looking for other work then or
-	-
client.fn	no actually right now no i just like what i'm doing
-	-
counselor.ec	okay okay but here's the thing you always have choices right
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.adw	you're an adult you have choices so you can either manage how you're using instead of doing it every day
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.adw	you do it every other day or you know manage how you're going to use it use it less frequently
counselor.adw	you could quit altogether that's your other option
counselor.rec	sounds like you're sort of not there yet at this point
client.c-2	nope
counselor.adw	take less risks when you're using
counselor.quc	have you thought about that sort of unsafety when you are using
client.fn	i use it i normally normally i do it at home now
-	-
counselor.res	okay so you do do it at home
client.fn	so
-	-
client.fn	i do it at home i leave my stuff at home do my drinking at home
client.fn	and then sometimes ( we go ) we go to the bar and have a few you know drinks
client.o-1	but nothing to the point where we're staggering out
-	-
counselor.quc	okay do you get behind the wheel
counselor.quc	do you drive
-	-
client.fn	i don't drive
-	-
counselor.quc	okay do you watch kids when you are high
-	-
client.fn	um if i'm driving i mean if i'm riding with somebody in the car yes i do look out
-	-
counselor.res	okay you look out right
-	-
client.fn	i'm just cautious it's just me i'm always like that
-	-
counselor.quo	when you say you look out what do you look out for
-	-
client.fn	you know like people in the crosswalks
client.fn	see if people are trying to cut in front of you or something like that
-	-
counselor.res	okay but you say you're not driving
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.adw	okay any other choices you'd make no changes
counselor.adw	you like things
client.fn	what's that
counselor.adw	the other choice you have also is that you make no changes
counselor.adw	you sort of leave things where they're at
counselor.adw	and then your other your fifth choice is to get some help
counselor.quc	you know that right
counselor.ec	okay so yeah i mean you have the power to to make you have the power and the choices to think about and it's what you do with it it's up to you
counselor.gi	so what i did want to do is give you this resource list of places to seek help
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	if that fifth choice is what you want to do
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.gi	okay because i think you know ultimately the risk i mean the point is to take you from this moderate risk and bring you down to really sort of no risk
counselor.gi	right because this questionnaire right here this d_a_s_t score triangle that you're looking at
counselor.wa	the higher you go up on this triangle that means the more at risk you'll be
counselor.wa	you'll be more likely to get to develop health problems
counselor.wa	you're more likely to get into legal situations
counselor.wa	you're more likely to affect your mental health emotional well being
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.wa	the higher you go up on this triangle
counselor.st	okay okay so mister_garcia i want to follow up with you in about one week
counselor.quc	what's a good number to call you
-	-
client.fn	um hang on a minute
client.fn	four_two_five_seven_seven_three_zero_three_three_two
-	-
counselor.res	zero_three_three_two
counselor.quc	okay is there a better time in the day to call you
-	-
client.fn	you can call me and just leave a message on my phone then i can get back to you
-	-
counselor.gi	okay so i hope you remember my name when i do call
counselor.gi	irena fahardo
-	-
client.fn	irena i understand
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	[laugh] so at this point i don't
counselor.quc	you know we talked about the choices right
-	-
client.fn	um-hum
-	-
counselor.rec	and you're saying you're really not willing to do anything at this point sort of leave things status quo
client.c-2	no
counselor.co	okay that resource list i gave you right there are you willing to at least take a look at that
client.fn	i will look at it
counselor.co	read it and maybe when we talk in about a week sort of talk about what's on there
counselor.co	can you agree to that
-	-

counselor.gi	okay so what joey asked you you've spent a lot of time with him answering a lot of questions and stuff
counselor.gi	what he did was he gives me this sort of profile of what you kinda talked about and then he scores you on this pyramid as to where you are at risk with your behaviors
client.fn	oh
counselor.gi	it's called the dast score d_a_s_t and it ( stand ) stands for the drug_abuse_and_screening_test
counselor.gi	and that's from what you two talked about is kind of ( where you ) how it might

client.o+3	stay busy stay busy it helps
counselor.res	stay busy
client.o+3	( you know i i you know ) i ain't ( no ) no motivator speaker or no god or nothing like that but ( you know i ) there's certain spots i go up there on the ave and there ain't none coming in and ( um ) they put the curtains ( you know ) across the stage ( you know ) and ( you know )

-	-
counselor.rec	so just to kinda summarize i don't wanna keep going back to that one thing ( is ) is that ( uh ) if there's something that you would like to be without it's without that and the best way for you to kinda do that is to believe in god and do some of your preaching and be recognized for that and to stay away from the areas and to keep busy
client.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o+3	stay busy that's the key word

counselor.fa	yeah
client.o-2	it's not something i have to have
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	so yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	well it sounds like ( you um ) you use it in a way that's pretty controlled
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	( um ) and that it works for you
-	-
client.o-2	yeah and ( you know ) to me i do it ( you know i'm ) i'm really cautious about the whole
client.fn	you know how people say drinking and driving is bad and all of that
client.o-2	so like with me whenever i do it i make sure i'm ( in home at ) at home and i'm not going nowhere else ( you know )
client.o-2	'cause even if i was to get in the car ( i ) i would feel ( te* ) terrible feeling like that ( you know ) so i don't never do it like that
client.o-2	( you know ) it's not something that i even it's not that i i'm not careless with that
client.fn	'cause i really do to me there's consequences to everything
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.o-2	you know so ( i i ) i'm really cautious about that i'm ( like ) oh my gosh i have to stay in the house and just be in the house let it do what it needs to do and then i'm done i'm just there you know ( so yeah )
-	-
counselor.rec	( so you really ) you understand that there is some risk involved and then ( you ) you are making decisions
client.fn	right
counselor.rec	based on that to reduce risk
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah because ( you know i ) i've seen people who abuse it and i've seen ( you know um ) and i ( you know ) and not only people
client.fn	but when i was younger of course ( you know ) smoking weed and then driving to work ( you know ) in that situation but i was young ( you know )
client.fn	and i know what that feels like
client.o-2	so as an adult now it's like you have to for me it's like i have to it's a [du] oh don't do this you gotta be within the house and going nowhere else and be here
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	'cause i would feel terrible ( you know ) even with that little bit in my system i would feel terrible if anything is to happen you know
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and i caused somebody else ( yeah ) i couldn't live with that that'd be too much it'd drive me insane
client.o-2	( so yeah ) i'm really cautious about all of that
-	-
counselor.af	yeah you're a thoughtful person
-	-
client.fn	thank you ( i i do ) i really do
client.fn	because i get really angry when i see people ( like )
client.fn	i'm always the designated diver to everything i have friends that party and stuff so i always suggest and put myself out there and say ( you know ) call me i'll come and get you or i'll drop you and come get you back with your own car [du] stuff like that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	'cause now i don't have my car ( so yeah ) that's a big thing to me
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	a very big thing and then of course when you're work release and to hear the stories about these women that was drinking and driving
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o-2	( even so ) even more so i'm ( like ) oh my gosh [du] everything i'm really cautious about
client.fn	'cause i would feel bad i couldn't live with that i could not live with that on my hands
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	at all ( so yeah ) i'm very anal about all of that yeah [laughter] i really am [laughter]
client.o-2	yeah people say well come on let's go no i have to sit in the house for a while [du] ( yeah )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-2	yeah i always do that so especially when i feel ( like ) i just especially when i have to hit the weed and i always make sure that i don't have no plans to be nowhere fast yeah and when i say nowhere fast it has to be ( two hours ) two three hours before ( you will ) i will be getting up to go to anything else
client.o-2	( yeah so ) yeah i'm very cautious with that
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o-2	i consider that
client.fn	( so ) yeah
-	-
counselor.af	good
counselor.fa	well
-	-
counselor.fa	well
-	-
counselor.af	well it seems to me like you're thoughtful of that how you're using and
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	( um ) and it works for you
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	and you're not interested in any kind of change and you understand that there are some risks
-	-
client.fn	right yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	and you're making accommodations for those
-	-
client.fn	yeah and ( you know like ) i talk to the doctors here ( you know ) of course
client.r+d2	( i do wanna you know )
client.r+d2	i don't wanna have to
client.o+2	( i ) you know of course it's gonna be at the point where i'm gonna go like you know what i this is it i don't need it ( you know it's just ) just live through it basically
client.o+2	( you know o* o* o* ) of course i'm gonna get to that point
client.o-2	i'm not there now i can honestly say that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o-2	so that i can say truthfully i'm not there i know that
client.r-2	'cause i do like just recently i was not feeling good i was supposed to see doctor [du] and that day i just was ( like ) oh my gosh it was insane and i could not i felt like somebody just came and sat on me with just all this ( uh ) i felt just really it was not me i was not feeling it was ( like )
client.r-2	i wasn't sick it was just felt ( like a really ) like there was a cloud over me it was so weird and i just couldn't do it and i was like oh my gosh i'm not going nowhere ( so yeah )
-	-
counselor.rec	( so you're hoping that ) it sounds like you're hoping there's a time when you're not gonna feel this way
-	-
client.r+d2	yeah i want it to ( like ) you know
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+d2	to be ( like ) oh okay you know you'll be okay just go with it you know ( so yeah ) }
client.o+2	cause for me going for me actually partying ( you know ) not partying but for me it's just smoking everyday now ( i ) i don't even ( like ) i don't miss it
client.r-n2	i only ( like ) when i'm feeling really sick is when i need it
client.r-n2	it's ( like ) oh my gosh i have to just to get all that yucky icky feeling for me to go away and then i'm done
client.r+2	and then i'm ( like ) it is funny because i always say to myself this is ( you know ) i'd be always thinking about ( like ) this is not normal is this normal i ( you know ) i'll ask myself ( you know )
client.fn	and i don't get i guess people say they get ( um ) some people will be ( um ) goofy or whatever they are
client.r-2	( uh ) to me i just know it feels good and i'm ( like ) okay i feel like my everything all the knots would go away and i'm good that's all
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i don't know how to explain all that ( but yeah )
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	now okay yup
-	-
client.fn	i'm doing a lot better for me
-	-
counselor.fa	when i first
-	-
client.fn	first met you
client.fn	i just told claire that
counselor.res	yeah well
client.fn	when i first found carrie i was in bad shape
counselor.res	you were
-	-
counselor.res	having a hard time yeah
client.fn	and then
-	-
client.fn	[du] so the most recent thing is with this mis* ( you know ) the pregnanc* ( you know ) being able to ( um ) get pregnant
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and that i'm dealing with very i mean not very well but i'm dealing with it in a way that
client.fn	seeing doctor [du] has been ( you know ) it's helping because ( you know ) she touches things that i don't think i would normally talk about
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but part of bringing it up makes it so much easier and ( you know ) we kinda get to the whole pregnancy thing and we go back and forth so it's really nice that she picks and chooses the things that she wants to ask
client.fn	because ( like i said ) i don't think that ( like ) she ( like ) today she asked me well what do you think that way she said it i don't know i there's so many things i it's easier for her to just throw it at me
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and then i can ( you know ) say oh yeah duh duh duh and duh duh duh. and [du]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) so that way to me ( is helping me ) is healing me in a way that i talk about it so
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah sounds like it's ( or* ) organizing things a little bit [du] think about and yeah
client.fn	yeah yeah yeah and then like
-	-
client.fn	her ( you know you know ) of course she her job is to take [du] and all that but
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	it's nice that to know at least she knows the things or the areas to pick on
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	or to work on not pick on i shouldn't say pick 'cause
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	it's not picking
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	it's working on so yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	i'm so glad you're doing that
-	-
client.fn	yeah i am too ( ya know ) i really am ( like ) ( a* a* )
client.fn	at first i was kinda leery 'cause i didn't know 'cause i was ( like ) am i going insane or am i ( you know you i ) i feel like people who go to see a psychiatrist they got a lot of issues
client.fn	and in my case i have issues in a lot of it has to do with depression and i didn't realize all this time that i was that depressed and it took somebody to ( like ) i guess touch things for me to ( like ) open up about them 'cause like i said i don't think i would talk about stuff ( you know ) like i said the most recent thing is with me not being able to conceive ( the way you know ) the way most women do
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and that's very hard and ( you know it's hard ) it's a swallow but i'm accepting it and making peace with that by myself ( you know ) with the help of doctor [du]
client.fn	all the help that i get here i am so appreciative you guys just don't understand yeah i am very thankful well for a lot of stuff so
client.fn	i'm [du] you guys here [laughter] yeah i do
-	-
counselor.af	well i think that ( you ) you were talking about the time when we first met and then when i met you most recently ( um ) i'm just so impressed with ( what ) what you have accomplished
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	thanks
counselor.af	( i feel ) i feel ( you are you are just mo* ) you are moving along
client.fn	yeah
counselor.af	and ( you're ) we're working day to day and ( um )
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and it helps
-	-
counselor.af	and it's obvious
-	-
client.fn	yeah it helps ( you know ) and 'cause when i first went to see her when you first set me up with her ( you know um ) she was ( like ) well you tell me how much days you wanna come here and then i was ( like you know ) i don't know if i wanna ( keep ) keep it i don't know if i wanna see this person twice a week why don't we do it once a week and i know this if i do the once a week
client.fn	it gives me time to ( you know ) have all these things to work on ( you know like ) you know i have all this ( like ) oh my gosh doctor [du] do you know what happened this week ( you know )
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	so it's not overwhelming her and it's not overwhelming me it's kinda healing in it's own way so yeah it's been very good to me yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.af	that's good
-	-
counselor.res	so ( um ) one of the things that you mentioned about your depression
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.su	( um a lot ) a lot of people have depression like you have depression
client.fn	yeah
counselor.af	and i think it's great that you're working on it
client.fn	yeah
counselor.af	( um and ) and identifying it and realizing ( connections )
client.fn	yeah [du]
counselor.af	making the connections
-	-
client.fn	i told her i'm [du] and i didn't realize how i was that depressed
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i guess 'cause i don't know if i'm hiding it in a way but i think maybe it's because i just kinda overlook it ( you know you cover it with ) or i was covering it with all the other things that was kinda happening ( you know ) right over eachother so i really didn't have time to really take care of that you know what i mean
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	so it was just in the back burner ( bur* bur* ) burning
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and it's gonna catch up with me ( so ) this way ( i'm i* ) it's been very good to me
-	-
counselor.af	good
-	-
client.fn	it really has it really really has
-	-
counselor.adp	( as ) as you work on your depression ( and ) and ( when you're ) when you're ready i want you to think about the fact ( that ) that marijuana is a depressant it does have that impact
counselor.rec	and so right now it sounds like [du] you're
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.o-2	mellow with it yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah
counselor.af	it's good
-	-
counselor.di	but just keep in the back of your [du] thoughts that
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.r+n2	you know what's funny i don't know if it even sounds right but like i said there's times when i'm like ( you know this needs to ) [du] needs to be a cut off with this 'cause i find myself ( telling asking mys* or ) telling myself that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+d2	( like you know ) i wanna completely
client.fn	it's like i said i used to oh my gosh every day i
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.af	so you've cut back quite a bit
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	a lot }
client.fn	to even where people are ( like ) what you don't smoke no more i was ( like ) no i really don't
client.r-2	use like when i'm not feeling good
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	aand ( you know ) of course i know where to find it because ( you know i ) i have that circle of people that i know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but other than that it's not ( like i said it's it's totally different ) a totally different person now but ( is ) it amazes me but it's so good for me ( it really is ) it really is such a positive thing to me
client.fn	and i'm glad that ( uh ) i have doctor [du] to really ( you know ) 'cause she's like the outsider she's not within my family ( you know ) she's not somebody that i see every day ( you know ) so for her it's not so much for passing judgement it's nice to know that she has a whole different perspective she's coming from a different angle versus my family that sees only this [sound effect] ( you know ) right down the isle [laughter] [du] ( you know )
client.fn	so yeah ( it's great ) it's been great so
-	-
counselor.af	good i'm glad that connection is working for ya
-	-
client.fn	yup i love that connection [laughter]
-	-
counselor.af	well i appreciate you meeting with me
-	-

-	-
counselor.rec	ah ah you think it wasn't even the right place
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.gi	no that's interesting
-	-
client.fn	think
-	-
counselor.gi	because you don't look you have many physical or even cognitive
client.fn	well i have my hand
-	-
client.fn	you know
-	-
counselor.gi	oh i see but that would be almost more of uh physical ( ther* ) yeah physical therapy
client.fn	physical
-	-
client.fn	i don't know
-	-
counselor.rec	( so when ) maybe it was meant to be huh
-	-
client.r+7	yeah that's what i'm saying

client.r+7	god sent me somewhere

counselor.gi	and
-	-
client.fn	he says until you ( g* ) feel like he said but if you ever you know feel like you've gotta talk call me you know

client.fn	i thought they were like you know
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-

client.fn	i usually take the key back to the share office
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	right
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	well okay they said you were supposed to pick the key up
client.fn	well they have a token or something that they give you in order to give share to pick up the key
client.fn	well i didn't have the token but they barred me
client.fn	because ( they ) they put these other people that are at the shelter in charge and the you know they power play you know ah well i'm just gonna bar [sound effect] ( so ) so
-	-
counselor.su	all that just makes it difficult
-	-
client.fn	i know and i was just like chaotic last night
counselor.su	oh my gosh
client.fn	i'm going why i said i didn't do anything wrong you know why how could you just kick me out on the street for four days
client.fn	you know i've been here almost three weeks you know what's going on you know and i was just oh
-	-
counselor.quo	so where would you go tonight jana
-	-
client.fn	well uh i've just been staying with friends
-	-
counselor.fa	have you okay
-	-
client.r-7	but see you know that don't work out either because then pretty soon because if they're active in drug use or alcohol or you know there's a it's something they want something you know
-	-
counselor.res	and that's what you were just talking about the fact that you need housing
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	i need to have my own spot
-	-
counselor.rec	to get away from that
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	so i'm not paying somebody money that i don't have you know in exchange for whatever you know [laugh]
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r+7	you know and i'm just i'm tired because ( i'm not i'm not going to be out ) i'm not into sex industry no more
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r+7	you know ( i ) i that was the number one i had to quit doing that
client.r+7	( i ) i because if i do that it just leads to the drug use you know
client.o+7	so [sound effect] it's all gotta go
-	-
counselor.rec	you've definitely ( you've definitely ) reached that point where it's enough is enough you know
-	-
client.o+7	yeah i'm done
-	-
counselor.quc	so when you pursue housing do you need to have your fiance with you
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.res	oh you don't
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.fa	no okay
-	-
client.fn	he's cool he's ( he's ) got his own drug thing going on ( it ) through drug court
client.fn	and he's ( he's ) gotta do what he's gotta do
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	you know to keep head above water
counselor.gi	so uh yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	( if you'd ) so if you'd like um we can put you you know we can pursue housing in ( in ) that regard
client.fn	i mean we can
counselor.gi	and there might be something else you know along the lines of cooper_house
counselor.gi	( i'm ) i'm not actually familiar with cooper_house myself
counselor.gi	i don't know if it's a transitional setting or a
client.fn	why
counselor.quc	is it a
-	-
client.fn	it's temporary [err] housing
-	-
counselor.res	it is it is transitional
-	-
client.fn	temporary yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	okay well
-	-
client.fn	but that's cool
-	-
counselor.rec	but you can get in sooner
-	-
client.fn	( it ) it yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and that ( that ) just means you know it'll give me time to put a little money away ( to ) for us to look for something else
-	-
counselor.af	good okay
-	-
client.fn	together
-	-
counselor.rec	see ( you ) you've got you've been ( en* ) you've been envisioning things jana haven't you

client.fn	my head spinning all the time
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah yeah

-	-
counselor.gi	but ( but ) imagine where you head would be if you didn't have these things that were pursuing
-	-
client.fn	no it would be empty
-	-
counselor.gi	it would be empty [laugh] because those are the ( the the ) that's huge uh that
-	-
client.fn	because your mind gets uh so wrapped up in ( in ) the hustle of everything that you ( you ) don't have time to think about what you really ( really ) gotta do
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	so you've made that decision
-	-

counselor.fi	bless you
counselor.res	okay ( so so that ) so you don't use the marijuana or you

client.fn	no ( i don't get ) i don't as of right now
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i mean i have used marijuana [sneeze] all my life i've run into marijuana one way or the other that's something i know very much about
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah well marijuana has it's own set of side effects also you know
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	so it sounds like you've cut back on the cocaine though because it
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah
counselor.res	because of medical advice
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	was that difficult for you
-	-
client.fn	was it um you know it's always been recreational it's never been something that is compulsive has been compulsive for me it's recreation
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and [du] wanna stop
client.r+3	especially since i moved into my apartment because used to go [du] ( i don't have ) the temptation has been very [sneeze] reduced
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	well then and are you happy with that
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	good good
-	-
client.fn	of course
counselor.gi	well some
client.fn	oh no no i'm not [laugh]
client.fn	of course i'm happy with that
-	-
counselor.gi	well some people ( miss ) say that you know they will always miss something
client.fn	hmmm
counselor.gi	they'll remember whatever their benefit physical or psychological from the
client.fn	ah
counselor.rec	but you feel like you're not missing it and it sounds like you have more important things your apartment your health
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+7	my health
-	-
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.r-7	yeah well it's been a situation where i have a date and we share you know drugs you know
client.fn	otherwise usually i'm not
-	-
counselor.rec	so social
-	-
client.fn	i'm not sitting there otherwise by myself
-	-
counselor.rec	so in a social situation
-	-
client.fn	yes
-	-
counselor.quc	even when you have the apartment
counselor.quc	would you have people over to your apartment to do that
-	-
client.fn	not no no no no no not lately no not for that purpose
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+7	but i know but i know that since i had my apartment compared with when i'm in the street i buy less of it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so having your own housing has reduced what you've used
-	-
client.r+7	yeah just temptation yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so it could be a tempting thing when you're out on the street and homeless
-	-
client.r-7	yes yes because you kind of um it's everywhere it's everywhere
counselor.fa	mm
client.r-7	and it gives you something to keep your mind off of you know anything you know
-	-
counselor.rec	you say that there's been a few times though that you've taken it to the apartment
-	-
client.fn	oh i didn't say that
-	-
counselor.res	okay so but there's been times that you've had the
-	-
client.fn	i have yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	and what's going on then
counselor.quo	what happens at that point
-	-
client.r-7	i have a date or
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so if you're with somebody ( that you're you share the ) you share some drugs with them
-	-
client.fn	it's happened in that situation
client.o-7	i said it's not necessarily a trigger or anything like that
-	-
counselor.quo	what do you mean trigger
-	-
client.o-7	it's not something that makes it a necessity
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so it sounds like you have dates where it isn't there
-	-
client.fn	right
-	-
counselor.rec	um-hum yeah so it's important that this not be a necessity to you
-	-
client.r+n7	( no it's not ) no it's not necessary to me not necessary
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	is there ever a time it does feel
-	-
client.r-7	when i'm depressed when i've been depressed i'm sure a couple times when i've been depressed and it's been available i have kind of been more acceptive of it
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.quc	okay ( so being ) so when you're feeling low when you're feeling depressed is there something going on
counselor.quc	or are you just feeling bad about yourself
-	-
client.r-7	When it's been available it has been easier it has been more acceptable
-	-
counselor.quc	does that are you feeling depressed now that you have housing
client.fn	no
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	no i've been very much less depressed since ( i've been since ) i've had the housing
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	in fact i'm less depressed i've had ( more ) more to do things you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i get on my computer and [du] and i just ( forget to ) forget the world you know i know how to operate it and it's always good for something you know
-	-
counselor.rec	( the compu* ) playing on the computer or working on the computer yeah ( you can ) a lot of time can go by when you're on the computer right yeah yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	right right
client.fn	right
counselor.rec	but when you have a date that doesn't sound like that would be too depressing
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so there are times when you
-	-
client.fn	( i'm just saying ) i'm just saying that that being the situation you know when it's happened you know couple times like that you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	um-hum um-hum
client.o-7	but it's not something that i sit there by myself and i say well you know i want to find a way to get me some drug and some [du] you know not like that [du]
-	-
counselor.quo	what is it like when you decide to have some drugs other than the date and
-	-
client.fn	it's because it comes with the situation you know
-	-
counselor.quo	what sort of situations
-	-
client.r-7	it comes with you know say i'm with a person that's you know suggest it or have access to it yeah i participate
counselor.fa	uh huh
-	-
counselor.res	you participate
counselor.quo	how do you feel when you do that
counselor.quc	( do you ever ) do you feel badly about that
counselor.quc	or is that okay with you
-	-
client.fn	uh i don't assess it like that
-	-
counselor.res	you don't assess it like that
counselor.quo	how do you assess it then
-	-
client.o-7	as just a part of the social
-	-
counselor.res	it's just part of your social
-	-
client.o-7	what i do [du] at the moment yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	is that anything you want to change
counselor.quc	or you're okay with that social moment or
-	-
client.o-7	yeah ( it never gets i never ) it's never too intense for me you know [du]
client.o-7	and besides this is something that probably happens very seldom
-	-
counselor.quc	do you ever see a time where you just would cut it off
client.fn	so you know it's like twice a month
-	-
client.o+7	yeah i can
client.o-7	( i don't see ) i don't have any it's been worse
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah so you've really sounds like you've really reduced what you use it's been worse
client.o-7	yeah it's been worse
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( it's been like ) it's been like going from every day when i was in the street to maybe once a month or so you know or less you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so you know i'm not thinking about it probably like right now i haven't had it you know i've had it in the last couple weeks
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.o-3	but it's not something that i'm anticipating that will happen again it might be just as far as i'm concerned it's in the past
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah yeah so you don't see future social 'cause it sounds like you don't go out and seek it you just have social situations where somebody might come by or you have a date
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.ts+3	i have somebody who was [du] call me and say well 'hey would you like to get together and do this you know' and i say no
-	-
counselor.rec	so you've been saying no more
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah ( i don't do ) i don't do it because somebody calls me and they need yeah you know money to get together
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and [du] if i want to contribute or anything like that you know stuff like that
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so that must make you feel good that you're able just to kind of tell somebody no when they're trying to get some group together
-	-
client.r+7	oh yeah ( not many no no ) yeah they don't come ask me 'cause they know they would not come ask to me if i want to
-	-
counselor.quc	so it sounds has there been a reduction in people calling you about it
-	-
client.r+7	people don't call me about it
client.r+7	i'm just saying that if because i'm not very obviously actively participating so ( i don't get ) i don't get suggestions
-	-
counselor.rec	uh huh yeah so now that you're not actively participating it sounds like it's sort of a date and you're not feeling this depressed it feels like it's
client.nc	laughing
-	-
client.fn	i think you're good enough on that date thing
-	-
counselor.fa	no
-	-
client.fn	i think you're good enough on that date thing
client.fn	so it's just ( that ) that situation that has happened you know
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	well sometimes when you invite somebody over for the date that's the expectation ( that they ) that part of their evening out is to have some cocaine
-	-
client.fn	yeah and i'm not so desiresome so desireable that i have dates all the time
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i don't feel like i'm that hot [laugh] that's just something happened
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	you know it's very irregular
-	-
counselor.rec	um-hum um-hum so you're cutting back it sounds like
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah okay you can put it like that
-	-
counselor.gi	but if it's not true i don't want to say that
-	-
client.fn	[laugh] no ( i'm to say ) talk about cutting back i would say way back
-	-
counselor.res	you would say you've cut way back
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.st	and then i guess getting back to the question i asked
counselor.quc	is do you see a time when you just won't use it at all
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.res	you do see a time
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	what would be happening in your life if that were to happen
-	-
client.fn	it's happening right now i think
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i'm not looking for it for a treat like that you know
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	you know i guess i would be like you know
-	-
counselor.quc	would you have to make any changes to make that
client.o-7	i haven't sworn against it
-	-
counselor.quc	okay if you were to swear against it would
-	-
client.o-7	it would be different you know i'm not i haven't sworn against it right now you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-7	but it's something that i don't go seeking and it's certain that it's i don't you know it'd be all right if i don't do it anymore ever
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-7	but it's not troubling for me right now
-	-
counselor.quc	okay if it became troubling what
-	-
client.fn	again
-	-
counselor.gi	well again
client.nc	[laugh]
counselor.rec	so it was troubling before
-	-
client.fn	oh yes
-	-
counselor.rec	it was a troubling situation
-	-
client.fn	oh yes
-	-
counselor.ec	but the cutting back you've done on your own and some of it
client.fn	yes
client.fn	yes
counselor.af	okay all right well that's good that's i'm really glad

client.fn	i have no idea
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah okay from one to ten what do you think it was
-	-
client.fn	five maybe

counselor.res	five okay
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	'cause the score's gonna range between zero and ten
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	um yours was eight
-	-
client.fn	okay
client.fn	and what does that mean
-	-
counselor.gi	well it means let me show you what it means
counselor.af	that's a good question
counselor.quc	eight ( this is what ) see this little triangle here
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	so eight is severe risk
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	and this is called the dast drug abuse screening test
-	-
client.fn	um-hum
-	-
counselor.gi	and it's been used to kind of measure to see the impact of drugs and how that affects people's lives
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	so that's uh
-	-
client.fn	well i've had it i've been on drugs for 28 years so it's been my main thing
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+3	and now i'll be going to treatment monday to try to kind of get back into socio-type stuff
counselor.af	oh wow
client.fn	but i was a functional addict
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i mean i went to school i did all ( my everything i did all ) my family stuff i raised my kids i did the whole work and go to school and all that and still did drugs so
counselor.fa	uh huh
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah so you were able to function but and get some things done
client.fn	very well function very
-	-
client.fn	nobody knew it just me so
-	-
counselor.rec	really so you just had this whole secret sounds like
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
client.fn	it was kinda weird i mean because i had this double life going on for a long time
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	and i was a city homemaker on one hand and going to school and working and all this you know
client.fn	i'd sneak out and go out at night and do things and sneak back in the morning and go to work or whatever
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	and i could use during the day where i was working and it wouldn't affect my ability to yeah
counselor.res	wouldn't affect your job or anything
-	-
counselor.rec	wow so it sounds like ( you had a you kind of ) it kind of didn't get in the way at all
-	-
client.fn	no uh-uh it wasn't that important to be
client.fn	a lot of people when they do cocaine the cocaine has the craving because it hits that pleasure nerve in your brain that causes
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	or not let me rephrase this there's a central nerve in your system that requires you to breathe and have water and food and everything else and cocaine has a tendency to hit that neuron [err] or whatever
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and once it hits that it's over i mean you're just [sound effect] off to the races you know
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	and i don't know if it just didn't hit the nerve or what but it didn't do that for me
counselor.res	it didn't do that for you
client.fn	no it just gave me a little pick-me-up you know it was more like drinking a cup of coffee or that five_hour energy or something like that it was just not something that had me just in one mindset
counselor.fa	i see
counselor.fa	uh huh
-	-
counselor.quo	so why are you changing
counselor.res	because now i'm hearing you you really want to change it [du]
client.r+3	well because because what's going on
-	-
client.r+3	what's going on is that it's become unfunctional over the course of the last couple years
client.r+3	it's getting to where i'm not functioning
-	-
counselor.rec	oh it's doing the opposite then
-	-
client.o+3	right i'm like spiraling
counselor.fa	uh huh
client.fn	i think it's like you go through phases in your addiction or something
counselor.fa	uh huh
client.r+3	for so many years you can do this and then eventually it starts messing with your brain cells to the point where you just you know
counselor.fa	uh huh
-	-
counselor.rec	so for a long time it served a function
client.fn	right
counselor.quo	and how long would you say that was
-	-
client.fn	probably a ten-year span
-	-
counselor.rec	so ten years it was functional it worked for you nobody knew but your whole thing
client.fn	right
client.fn	but then yeah
-	-
client.o+3	but then ( after within the last say since i ) in the last eight months or so it's been spiraling
client.r+3	all of a sudden now people are wondering why i'm not showing up this place or that place or why didn't when they call i don't answer the phone or something like i isolate
-	-
counselor.res	oh so ( things that ) you're saying things have changed now in the last eight months
-	-
client.r+3	it's affecting me more emotionally than it did
counselor.rec	emotionally
-	-
counselor.rec	with friends family
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	you have kids and
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+3	i'm ignoring them to do drugs
-	-
counselor.su	oh boy
-	-
client.r+3	i'm not i'm not the happy grandmother or the mother or the friend or anything that is
-	-
counselor.rec	your relationships have really shifted
client.r+3	are crumbling crumbling yes
-	-
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
client.fn	and this has been happening over the last year
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.fn	'cause i got clean before and i had eleven months clean and i just i've relapsed
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and since that relapse it's just the whole street thing and running
client.fn	and i did the homeless thing for fifteen years [du] behind drugs you know
client.fn	i'm talking about way in my early use in ' 81
counselor.fa	uh huh
client.fn	between ' 81 and ' 97 i was good functioning from ' 97 to 2010 or ' 09 nonfunctional
-	-
counselor.res	nonfunctional
-	-
client.fn	yeah for a while
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	then i got clean from 2009 to 2010 now since 2010 about four months ago i started using again
client.r+3	and when i started using again everything started crumbling
client.r+3	i mean my housing was in jeopardy um my housing meaning that i could have became homeless
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	again i could have lost everything that i had gained by being clean
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	like i had got a car family relationships were good housing you know the whole thing
-	-
counselor.rec	i'm hearing that ( you're like you're really clearly you're ) like to look back at that since what ' 81
counselor.quc	is that when you started using drugs
counselor.rec	and like you can clearly look back and say okay this time this really didn't interfere with ( my ) who i am you know how i see myself being producting being a mom being a grandma or whatever
client.fn	um-hum
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	and i don't think you were a grandma in ' 81
-	-
client.fn	i'm a grandma now not in ' 81

client.fn	no not in ' 81
-	-
counselor.fa	okay all right
-	-
client.fn	i've got a two_year_old and a four_year_old grandkid

counselor.rec	okay okay but then you can look back and you can see okay clearly that you know it started i'm hearing most of your relationships
-	-
client.r+3	yeah are starting to crumble
-	-
counselor.rec	and those are important to you

client.fn	and then i got off my pity pot and said hey you know this ain't you
-	-
counselor.quo	( you ) your what
-	-
client.fn	i got off my pity pot
-	-
counselor.res	oh you got off your pity pot okay

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i said you know what do i want to spend the rest of my life like this i am productive i have a college education what am i doing here
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	you know kind of like when you can't get on drugs for a while you kind of face reality [laugh] you start facing reality
client.fn	and you're saying to yourself hey i got a masters in child development what do i look like being out here in the street sleeping on the ground
-	-
counselor.su	oh man
-	-
client.fn	you know
-	-
counselor.rec	yes you had a big wake-up call and you're like oh pity party's over you know

counselor.res	go
client.fn	so i got clean
client.fn	[laugh] and you know and then about three months ago my addict started gettin' me again which he did for a while my addict got me pretty good there for a while
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	and i just woke up probably about three weeks ago and just said you know here we go again are we gonna you know are we getting complacent in our wallowing in our drama [laugh]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	i'm hearing that you're really committed to you know you have a plan this next week you're going into treatment
client.fn	uh huh

client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	really where you going
-	-
client.fn	uh sunbird
client.fn	i have to be there on the second and i will come out
-	-
counselor.rec	this is really important to make this change
-	-
client.o+3	yes it is
-	-
counselor.res	yeah
-	-
client.o+3	and ( it's not ) it's not anything legal it's not nobody pushing me this is just
-	-
counselor.rec	no no you're really clear it's about you and your family
-	-
client.r+3	it's about me too a lot about me
counselor.res	you and your family
client.r+3	self esteem it's about the self esteem
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r+3	the self destruction you know let's get that out
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	let's find out what the core of everything was [laugh]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	i mean it's important for you to take care of yourself you like to dress nice you like you know taking care of yourself and that that's part of who you are this other piece just doesn't fit in there
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+3	no it doesn't
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i don't even fit into ( that ) the people out here i just don't even really fit in with them
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
client.fn	so it's not like you know um have you ever hung around a crowd that you really just didn't really fit with
-	-
counselor.gi	oh yeah yeah
-	-
client.fn	you know but you kind of was just thrown in for some reason maybe an ulterior motive or
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but see the alternative for me is the drugs so it's hardly ulterior motives
counselor.fa	yeah uh huh
client.r+3	but the people that are dealing in drugs and the people that are in the streets i never really had a lot in common you know there wasn't a common ground there
counselor.rec	would not are not people
client.fn	of course i got along with everybody
counselor.rec	so ( if it wasn't ) if there weren't drugs
-	-
counselor.rec	you wouldn't be drinking coffee and you know talking about [du]
client.r+3	no or grandkids or whatever
-	-
client.r+3	these aren't the people that i would generally even associate with if i wasn't using
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	so i'm like i mean don't get me wrong i've spent a lot of time in the streets and i have a lot of friends there in the streets
counselor.fa	mmmm
client.r+3	it's just that i never really clicked in with that fast life you know that fast lane thing you know
client.r+3	( i was always ) i was never in the crowd i was always off to the side sitting by myself i never
-	-
counselor.su	yeah i hear you
counselor.res	no you're
-	-
client.r+3	and really with drugs doing the whole paranoia thing on me too
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	and i ( was ) never had a bad experience with drugs as far as violence
client.r+3	but i always think that somebody's gonna do something really crazy to me you know
-	-
counselor.rec	and that goes partly with crack
-	-
client.r+3	yeah so that's the paranoia thing
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	it's not the police i could care less if they talk to me they're harmless
client.r+3	i'm talking about you know the way i dress and the way i carry myself maybe just somebody that doesn't know me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i'm not homeless i've never carried like backpacks and stuff like that
client.r+3	so what i'm saying is i always felt like somebody might see me and think i have money and desperate people do desperate things and so i didn't know if they'd try to you know get me off somewhere and beat me up and try to rob me or you know stuff like that
client.fn	which it never happened
counselor.rec	it's really important
-	-
counselor.rec	for you to make this change
-	-
client.o+3	yeah it's very important
-	-
counselor.quo	how confident are you that you can make it
-	-
client.fn	how confident on a scale of one to ten probably a six
client.fn	and i'm saying that because
-	-
counselor.rec	six being that you can complete this
-	-
client.o+3	oh i'm gonna complete the thirty days
counselor.rec	to maintain
client.fn	but the maintain part is probably a six just fifty_fifty
client.o-3	i mean it's not i'm not promised anything so i don't want
-	-
counselor.quo	why isn't it like lower like a three or a two
-	-
client.o+3	because ( i'm pretty str* i'm pretty i'm pretty ) my head's pretty strong on this i mean i'm really determined
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm-hum
client.o+3	last time i went in i wasn't ( very ) as determined as ( i was ) i am this time
client.o+3	to really work the steps you know to really get into that whole
counselor.fa	mm-hm
-	-
counselor.res	so you're really focused you're really determined
client.fn	right
counselor.rec	( you're really ) you've been there you know where you slipped the last time it's different this time
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	right
-	-
client.fn	well i didn't do the ( ninety days ) ninety meetings ninety days i didn't do that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i didn't get a sponsor
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	i didn't go to the meetings
client.fn	i just felt like okay i can do this on my own
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	that lasted about six
client.fn	months [laugh] i mean hell i started [du] the relapse process was just like you know contemplating and then
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	thinking about it
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	( so you know ) so this is different now because it sounds like you really know mentally what goes through your head too in relapse
-	-
client.fn	yeah the steps and what i go
counselor.rec	the drama
client.r+3	yeah exactly the mental energy that's wasted [laugh]
-	-

counselor.st	and this is where i kind of just want to tell you what i think i'm hearing
counselor.quc	can i tell you
-	-
client.fn	you can sure
-	-
counselor.rec	um i think that the reasons for making this change are ( you ) you don't see yourself as and it's not in a negative way because they're people they're human beings on the street but you don't have the same kind of drive as they do or a different way of being that they do you're different from that you haven't
client.fn	right
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	i'm not gonna rob a person because i think they have money in their pocket i'm not gonna bust them in their head and take their money i'm not gonna rip 'em off for twenty_bucks to go get high you know
counselor.fa	right
counselor.rec	right you have a family you have children grandchildren
client.r+3	if they wanna buy a twenty i'm not gonna say hey i've got it and then grab the twenty_dollars and run you know i'm not that way i never have been so
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so there's you know a lot of reasons you know the street life your family and then yourself just that you are you don't see yourself as being addicted to these drugs and having that be your focus
-	-
client.fn	right like my when i was homeless at one point that's when i went into treatment last time it was all about crack it was never about ( ever seeing my never ) seeing a future
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	if you'd have asked me two years ago ( what i felt ) where i see myself in five years i couldn't have told you nothing
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.fn	where do you see yourself in six months i can't tell you i don't know i don't care you know [laugh]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	i mean that's where i was at you know what i'm saying and that's not a good place

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	you know and maybe i can be a part of that by being honest you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and letting you know that hey i'm not perfect you know i don't think anybody is
client.r+a3	but i know that i have the ability to change some things in my life and make them positive

-	-
client.fn	i guess
-	-
counselor.quc	remember that
-	-
client.fn	yes
-	-
counselor.gi	okay and they're research questions we're trying to figure out see if certain techniques work
client.fn	oh
counselor.gi	and so you answered some questions yesterday that was scored
counselor.quc	are you interested in what the number was
-	-
client.fn	( i'm not ) i wouldn't know what to make of that number really
-	-
counselor.gi	really okay well i'll help you do it
client.fn	you can explain it
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah i'll help you
counselor.gi	okay so you answered some questions and scored between i think zero and ten
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	and there's a number and the number is associated with let me show you without giving it all away
counselor.gi	it's this triangle so here's this is zero area and this has to do with use
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.gi	and then ( this ) it's going up to more and more severe use
counselor.quc	so ( where do you think ) what number do you think you had
-	-
client.fn	ten being the highest
-	-
counselor.gi	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	four
-	-
counselor.af	right on
counselor.quc	did you see the number
-	-
client.fn	i did
-	-
counselor.gi	okay okay [laugh] okay so four means you're right here moderate risk
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.quo	what do you think about that
-	-
client.fn	moderate risk of
-	-
counselor.af	well that's a good question
counselor.gi	moderate risk means let's see no risk how much harm does your drug use expose you to
-	-
client.fn	oh there's a moderate yes risk associated with
-	-
counselor.gi	the level of drug use that you're currently using
client.fn	oh
counselor.quc	does that makes sense
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	and it says here alcohol marijuana
counselor.quc	is that it
-	-
client.fn	artificial marijuana [du]
-	-
counselor.quo	what's artificial marijuana
-	-
client.fn	cannabis and stuff
-	-
counselor.quc	the sting
-	-
client.fn	yeah there's all different kinds
-	-
counselor.quo	what is this
-	-
client.fn	it's artificial
-	-
counselor.quc	is it incense
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	what do you do with it
-	-
client.fn	you set it on fire
-	-
counselor.quc	do you smoke it or
-	-
client.fn	yes
-	-
counselor.gi	this is not for human consumption
-	-
client.fn	that is true yes
-	-
counselor.quc	what's that
-	-
client.fn	um-hum
-	-
counselor.res	yeah it does say that you're saying
-	-
client.fn	yes
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah okay are you afraid that that might hurt your brain somehow
-	-
client.fn	uh no
-	-
counselor.rec	no okay so it sounds like ( you're ) you think that's pretty safe stuff is what you're saying
-	-
client.r+2	i don't know probably not
-	-
counselor.res	probably not
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	okay so sounds like you are level four of risk
counselor.quo	what do you think about that
-	-
client.r+2	perhaps the way i use is open susceptible to sabotage
-	-
counselor.quo	sabotaging who
-	-
client.r+2	oh that's the funny thing something's being laced
client.fn	right you've heard that term
-	-
counselor.quc	what's that
-	-
client.fn	you've heard of lacing
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah yeah
-	-
client.fn	sabotage kind of like
client.fn	but boy that would be a strange form of sabotage if it takes resources away from somebody else
-	-
counselor.gi	mmmm ( so sounds like ) okay between zero and ten and you're at a four
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	and as far as you know sort of the amount of risk moderate risk
counselor.res	that you have and you think and i'm hearing you say ( that you ) that it might be sort of so the concern might be sabotage
-	-
client.fn	the risk involved moderate risk associated with my drug use
counselor.gi	yeah well you have yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	from zero to ten you've got a risk factor of four which
counselor.gi	would put you in the moderate risk range that the amount of harm that you're doing is like moderate risk
client.fn	hmmm
-	-
client.fn	okay can you explain that more
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	okay so moderate risk means what harm that the drug does to you does to
counselor.gi	somebody it could mean a lot of different things like socially homelessness poor relationships health jail
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	extortion blackmail
-	-
counselor.quc	what's that
-	-
client.fn	know what
-	-
counselor.res	what ( so the ) no you wanted me to explain what the harm is you know what the harm
client.fn	no no
client.fn	oh harm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	yeah and then um ( so ) so i'm hearing you say that ( that your ) your level of risk is not are you concerned about it or not
counselor.gi	i'm not quite sure
counselor.quc	can you explain that
-	-
client.fn	not terribly
-	-
counselor.quo	okay um it sounds like uh okay so how important is it for you to change any of your drug use
counselor.gi	say again from one to ten ten being really important to change and one being not at all
-	-
client.fn	six
-	-
counselor.quo	six why isn't it lower
-	-
client.fn	because
-	-
client.fn	i have my reasons
-	-
counselor.gi	okay just asking
-	-
client.fn	that's okay
-	-
counselor.res	okay ( 'cause you said ) okay so between one and ten you're at a six
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	and ten being ( the really ) that it's important to change
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.res	okay ( and so ) and you're saying you have reasons but you don't want to say what they are
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	okay how confident is it for you to make that change again from zero or one to ten
-	-
client.fn	six
-	-
counselor.rec	six okay so you feel pretty confident
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	okay why didn't you give yourself a lower number
-	-
client.fn	oh because there's a lot of different kinds of joys in this world
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.r+2	i don't imagine clinging to one to get me through the rest of my pitiful life
-	-
counselor.rec	so i'm hearing you say that there's a lot of you're thinking about joy and pain
-	-
client.fn	yeah they're sure it's related
-	-
counselor.quc	feeling pretty sad
-	-
client.fn	yes occasionally
-	-
counselor.res	occasionally
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.quc	so on a scale again from one to ten being say happy is ten sad is one where are you right now
client.fn	um-hum
-	-
client.fn	seven
-	-
counselor.res	so pretty happy
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	okay and so i'm hearing you say that it sounds like you do you smoke marijuana or you drink alcohol pretty much daily
-	-
client.fn	pretty much
-	-
counselor.res	um-hum and that you see it as a moderate risk
-	-
counselor.res	sort of
-	-
counselor.rec	you're not really quite sure what that means
counselor.rec	but you're also talking about that you're it's important for you to change this and you're pretty confident that you can do it you're pretty high up there
-	-
client.r+a2	well yeah ( it's not ) i mean i've done it before
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r-n2	it's not necessary
client.o+2	but at this moment if i can i probably would
-	-
counselor.rec	so you've done it before you've been successful in the past in making that change and you know it sort of seems like it's something you could do if you want to do it but right now you're just not really thinking about if that's something you want to do
-	-
client.fn	um-hum
-	-
counselor.res	i want to go back to something else you said earlier about a pitiful life
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	now how does the marijuana alcohol use tie into pitiful life
counselor.quc	did you have a pitiful life when you were clean before
-	-
client.fn	yeah although
-	-
counselor.gi	'cause that's your terms not my terms those are your words
-	-
client.fn	okay but your word was clean
client.fn	so i'll take that as meaning after use had begun and then seceded
-	-
counselor.res	well yeah you had said that you had a period of your life when you were clean and sober
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah when you weren't using the stuff on a daily basis maybe you cut down
counselor.gi	i'm not sure
counselor.res	but you said that you had done it before and you're pretty confident you can do it again
counselor.res	and you also said something about about pitiful life
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	and so i ( wasn't sure ) wasn't sure how much of the use is tied into this idea that you have a pitiful life
-	-
client.fn	that term is
-	-
counselor.gi	'cause this is pretty strong language
-	-
client.fn	my apologies if i offend you by offending me but i don't care
-	-
counselor.quc	what's that
-	-
client.fn	i don't care
-	-
counselor.quo	about what
-	-
client.fn	about if you think that i'm hard on myself
client.fn	if that's the case but
-	-
client.fn	so i lost my train of thought
client.fn	continue please
-	-
counselor.adw	okay um well you know you have different options of what you could do
client.fn	uh huh
counselor.adw	you can cut down your drinking or your marijuana use
counselor.adw	you could cut out both of them the marijuana and alcohol
client.fn	uh-huh
counselor.adw	you could choose to not do anything where you're gonna get in trouble
counselor.gi	you know for instance some people say you know i'm gonna continue drinking but i'm not gonna drive or i'm not gonna or i'm gonna continue using drugs but i'm not gonna drive and i'm not going to go to this one neighborhood where i know it's not safe because i want to have all my functioning
-	-
client.fn	i don't have access to a vehicle
-	-
counselor.gi	no but you know like doing things that might be unsafe like limiting marijuana use or alcohol use to where you feel you won't get hurt
client.fn	yeah i do
-	-
client.fn	i generally prefer safe environments
-	-
counselor.adw	okay so but these are options for change that if you choose to you know and you could just leave it as it is do nothing
counselor.adw	or you can also get some help to help you with change
counselor.gi	and that's through you know there's aa na different treatment groups
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.res	okay ( so that's ) so what i'm hearing you say
counselor.quc	can i tell you what i'm hearing
-	-
client.fn	okay
counselor.quc	sure
-	-
counselor.res	okay i've heard you say that you drink and you smoke marijuana kind of on a daily basis
counselor.res	pretty much you have selected placed where you feel safe and that's important for you you
-	-
client.fn	yeah it's tough to come by i'll tell you
-	-
counselor.res	but it's on your mind it's something you're thinking about
counselor.res	and you feel really if you want to make a change you could do it you're pretty high up there
counselor.res	you're pretty confident you could do it you've done it in the past
counselor.quc	um is there anything else i could add to that
-	-
client.fn	that's exactly what you
-	-
counselor.gi	what i thought i heard you say
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	( that's ) i'm just reflecting what you said

client.o-2	that's it the rest is everything cool with me man ( you know )

counselor.rec	and so ( you're you're ) you've decided that you're okay with making that sacrifice at least as much as you can do because ( it's ) it's a legal thing yeah alright
client.fn	[du] so
client.o-2	that's right
counselor.af	so i appreciate you talking to me about that
counselor.ec	and i'm certainly not trying to ( you know ) make ( a j* ) any kind of judgment about what your choices are
client.fn	oh
-	-
client.fn	i know i know
counselor.gi	um
-	-
counselor.quc	i wanted to ask if you're interested in hearing ( um uh ) the results of one of the ( um ) tests that you took one of the screening tests that you took
counselor.gi	( um ) it's called the drug abuse screening test
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	and it ( um ) rates people's ( um ) level of risk from drug use on a scale ( of ) from zero to ten ( um ) with ten being severe risk and zero being absolutely no risk
-	-
counselor.gi	and ( um it ) this is a questionnaire that was given to a whole bunch of people and it's supposed to rate ( how ) how much risk ( you may be in ) you may have in terms of your drug use
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	and risk means ( like ) risk for health problems risk for financial problems risk for legal problems
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	( um ) so in terms of how you answered or how you perceive or how you see your level of risk as it pertains to your drug use where do you think you would score on a scale of zero ( of ) which means no risk and ten which is severe risk
-	-
client.fn	you're asking me
-	-
counselor.quo	yeah what do you think
-	-
client.fn	well my marijuana smoke is it
-	-
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.o-2	i have no risk
-	-
counselor.res	no risk
counselor.quo	if you think about it in terms of legal risk risk from the legal system ( a legal system ) risk for financial problems risk for health problems ( how would you ) what kind of risk do you think you might
-	-
client.r+2	yeah for health problem that's being a problem
-	-
counselor.res	yeah so there is a health risk component
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( but ) but i don't know
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.quo	what's the health risk
client.r+2	well i have my health risk is that i smoke pot a lot and when i smoke pot i eat a lot
-	-
counselor.res	okay so the health risk to marijuana is overeating
-	-
client.r+2	yeah ( that that ) that's what i do sometimes ( you know ) i eat too much because the weed make me eat a lot and that's my problem [du] when i go to sleep i go full [du] and that's when i wake up with my pain in my stomach
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	and you're anxious to see your provider about that
-	-
client.fn	ah ( you know ) and that's what i take in my pills ( my cai* ) my painkillers and then i fall asleep but no pain
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.res	you're fine
-	-
counselor.fa	okay alright
client.fn	so
counselor.quc	so can you think of a level of risk that ( you may you may be ) you may perceive yourself at from marijuana smoking just in terms of health or ( financ* ) finances or legal or any
-	-
client.o+2	yeah could be both could be financial ( you know ) if the rest of the people started doing drug testing and thing i'm gonna lose that job too and ( then ) then i won't have no job because ( that ) everything else is drug test now
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.rec	right so there's a little bit of risk there
-	-
client.r+2	yeah there is a little bit of risk
counselor.gi	so
-	-
counselor.quc	and ( in this um ) if you're interested to see ( um ) how the ( the um ) screening test scored you
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	( um ) it has you at ( um ) a number two which is some risk
counselor.gi	so ( you know ) that sounds pretty accurate
client.o-2	it's not that bad eh
counselor.gi	it's a little bit of risk well the bad or good is it sort of depends on how you perceive it ( um )
-	-
counselor.gi	it's some
client.fn	so ( i'm ) i'm from zero i'm number two
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah some risk ( that's that's ) that's low it's not no risk
counselor.res	but you've identified some of the risks that you're taking by smoking marijuana and it sounds like you're okay ( with ) with taking those risks
client.fn	[du]
counselor.gi	( as ) as far as you can be i mean
client.o-2	yeah i am
-	-
client.fn	i'm a survivor man i don't care what i gotta do

client.fn	( if you know i ) i work for my money i don't ask nobody for nothing you know what i mean
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	so if something ( go ) go bad ( you know ) it's gonna be my fault nobody else
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.quo	( what do you think ) what would have to go bad for you to ( s* ) maybe think about wanting to make a change
-	-
client.fn	quit smoke marijuana you say
counselor.gi	yeah
client.o+2	have no job at all and have no choice ( that's ) that's just about it
client.fn	like i told you right now ( i be ) and the last ten year i be in only restaurant business ( you know ) because they don't ask for drug test
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so ( if it ) if restaurant companies started drug testing that might be a reason for you to say i need to change my lifestyle
client.o+2	exactly
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.o+2	exactly but they [du] i wouldn't have no choice
-	-
counselor.quc	mm do you think you could do that ( if ) if it came to that

counselor.fa	right
client.r-2	but so far i don't have to
-	-
counselor.quc	on a scale of one to ten with zero being not at all confident and ten being the most confident how confident are you that you could make that change if you had to
-	-
client.r-d2	ah i don't know because i like it man i like marijuana

counselor.su	wow
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	is there an explanation as to the cause of it
client.r+4	uh i_v
-	-
client.r+4	drug use
client.fn	and ( uh ) i also have ( s* ) underlying ( r* ) rheumatological condition
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	they don't know if it's lupus or if it's vasculitis or what it is
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	they're trying to figure it out
-	-
counselor.quo	yeah how would you feel about talking a little bit more about your i_v drug use
-	-
client.fn	that's fine
-	-
counselor.st	okay ( um ) kinda let ( you ) you start
counselor.quo	and tell me a little bit about your experience
counselor.gi	that's really why we're here
counselor.gi	i'm not here to ( um )
-	-
client.fn	( i've just ) i've been shooting heroin for twelve years
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+d4	and it sucks
client.c+4	and ( uh ) i'm ready to stop
client.r+4	so this is killing me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so ( that's that's ) i mean that's the gist of it
-	-
counselor.quc	mm-hmm is this your first time experiencing some medical complications from your use
client.r+4	oh no
client.r+4	it's
-	-
client.r+4	been going on for years
counselor.res	going on
-	-
counselor.rec	this is kind of the final straw it sounds like
-	-
client.r+4	yeah ( it's i'm just it's ) i'm done
client.r+4	( i'm ) i've been put out to pasture
client.r+4	( i don't ) i don't have it in me anymore i just don't have it in me
client.r+4	i'm tired
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah any benefits to using anymore
-	-
client.r-4	it might kill me faster
-	-
counselor.quo	how is that a benefit
-	-
client.fn	well i mean versus dragging it out
client.fn	( you know like ) i mean hopefully i don't die fast from ( uh ) the permanent damage that i've done
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-4	but ( if i ) if i didn't want to drag it out anymore i could use and ( you know ) get it over with [laugh]
-	-
client.fn	that's pretty much only benefit
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+4	so pretty much no there's no benefits to it
counselor.rec	no
-	-
counselor.rec	benefit anymore
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	and what in your mind are the benefits ( to ) to changing how you're using so either cutting back or
-	-
client.fn	there is no cutting
counselor.quo	or quitting
client.fn	back ( there's there's no ) i can't cut back
client.fn	( it's either i need to ) i've never gotten clean ( like ) really clean before
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so i don't know i just know that i'm gonna die i'm gonna die it's gonna happen [laugh] like this fast
-	-
client.r+4	i won't live to see thirty if i keep using the way i use
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so that's pretty much it
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like the only option is to quit and quit once and for all and be done with it or else or else i mean there's really no other no other avenue from what i'm hearing right
client.r+4	that's right
counselor.rec	and it sounds like you've maybe made some attempts in the past to get clean you mentioned that you [du]
client.fn	yeah but
-	-
client.fn	not anything significant or substantial
-	-
counselor.quc	did you go to treatment or
-	-
client.fn	sure but wasn't in it for the right reasons
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah ( are ) are there any differences between then and now
-	-
client.o+4	i'm in it for the right reasons
-	-
counselor.quo	and what are those
-	-
client.r+4	( um ) i wanna live
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	before it was like i had to do it for probation or to get my kid back or ( you know )
client.fn	so i failed all that miserably so it wasn't for the right reasons
-	-
counselor.rec	and it sounds like now it's for your own personal
client.r+4	for me
counselor.rec	yeah it's for you it's for your livelihood it's for your well-being sounds like it's also for ( your ) your health because it's been pretty compromised
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	that's pretty much what it comes down to is physically i will expire before i wait to be ready to do it
client.r+4	because i want to do it ( like ) i have to do it in order to live
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	so what is it going to take
-	-
client.fn	i don't know
-	-
counselor.res	don't know
counselor.su	that's fair oftentimes we don't know
counselor.gi	naomi was telling me a little bit and i was reading here when i came in that you've been using methodone you've been prescribed methodone for pain it sounds like
counselor.quc	are you getting any other benefit from that as far as
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	yeah
client.fn	yes
-	-
client.r+4	when you're on a_hundred_and_forty milligrams of methodone you really don't think about shooting heroin
client.r+4	it just kind of fills up those receptors
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+4	and so it's been a lot easier
client.r-4	i'm not struggling with the addiction to the drugs as much right now as the lifestyle
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so
-	-
counselor.su	yeah i imagine that's quite difficult
client.r-4	the thinking
counselor.rec	kind of that idea ( of s* ) of going out and seeking or
client.fn	hm no
-	-
client.r-4	( that just uh ) people
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-4	( um ) selling money ( you know ) that kind of thing
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-4	phone calls things like that just the lifestyle there's a lot that goes with it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-4	a lot so
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like maybe ( one of the barriers ) one of the biggest barriers is breaking free from ( that ) that social group
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	and those phone calls and those friends and
-	-
client.fn	yeah all of it
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+4	i'm going to meetings
client.r+4	my old man he doesn't use anymore and he's been clean for seven months and we have clean and sober friends
client.o+4	and so i've been trying to stay on top of that
counselor.af	fantastic
client.r-4	yeah it's just new
-	-
counselor.su	mm-hmm yeah it's a change it's a big change
counselor.rec	it sounds like you definitely have the support behind you it's just a matter of making the commitment
client.r+4	yeah i do
client.fn	right
-	-
counselor.st	well what i can share with you today if you'd like is ( um ) the results of our study and some of the paperwork that you filled out
counselor.quo	what were your thoughts
counselor.st	( um ) before we jump into that
counselor.quo	when you were completing everything what were you feeling
counselor.quo	what were you thinking
-	-
client.fn	i'm in pain right now so i'm not really all there
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i have to go fill my prescription so i'm kinda like
-	-
counselor.su	okay understandable
client.nc	[laugh]
counselor.gi	so ( um ) what we do is based on your responses ( um ) from the study we come up with a score
counselor.gi	it's called a dast score it's a drug abuse screening test score
counselor.gi	and we think of this ( uh ) scale as like a richter scale so ( it the ) the disparity is pretty high ( uh ) between no risk to severe risk
-	-
counselor.st	and let me ( sh* ) share real quick if you would like ( um ) where your score ( uh ) fell
counselor.gi	based on what you endorsed you were in the high severe risk category or high danger to drug use
counselor.gi	and so what this means is ( that um ) that you may have medical injuries you may have mental or emotional consequences from your use
-	-
counselor.gi	and ( this ) these are things that we've already talked about
client.fn	right
counselor.gi	( um ) and so oftentimes what we look for what we advise folks in these categories to do is to cut back in some way like we've already talked about
counselor.gi	or kind of look at their use and how they can change it quitting ( you know ) or even staying the same if that's something that they prefer to do
-	-
counselor.quc	( um ) looking at this does this change anything
-	-
client.fn	it's nothing i don't already know
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	it just reinforces your feelings
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	okay well we have a couple options ( you know ) that i can offer you ( from ) from at least my standpoint
counselor.res	and one it sounds like the methodone is like you mentioned helpful with kind of curbing that
client.fn	i'm
-	-
client.fn	trying to get connected with ( um ) another social worker
client.fn	now that i got d_s_h_s medical coupons
client.fn	to get
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	on a methodone maintenance
-	-
counselor.af	excellent
counselor.res	okay so you already have that in the works it sounds like
counselor.af	great
counselor.gi	i do have a list of resources for treatment too
client.fn	cool
counselor.quc	is that something you'd be interested in

counselor.gi	so ( um ) basically ( um ) all of the scores are on a zero to ten scale
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	[nvv] ( um ) and it looks like according to this that ( um ) you actually scored a nine
counselor.gi	which would ( kind of ) be ( um ) a little bit more on the severe risk scale
-	-
client.fn	okay [laughs]
-	-
counselor.quo	( so ) [laughs] so ( how do you ) how do you feel about that
counselor.quo	what do you think

counselor.quo	okay could you tell me a little bit more about that
client.fn	what
-	-
client.fn	exactly do you guys mean by severe risk severe risk of what
-	-
counselor.gi	severe risk could be anything it could be health problems
counselor.gi	( um ) it could be something like ( um you know ) drinking and driving
client.fn	okay yeah
counselor.gi	i mean a little bit more severe risk to your health or to your person so
client.fn	severe
-	-
client.fn	risk [du] anything okay pretty yeah
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+3	( uh yeah ) no i would agree oh yeah most definitely
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	all right ( um ) and it looks like that you had mentioned here ( um ) that in the past month you had ( um ) done cocaine marijuana and alcohol
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	okay ( um ) so yeah ( um ) can you tell me a little bit more about sorta your reaction to looking at this and what you think
client.fn	i mean
-	-
client.o+3	( they ) i don't really have a reaction because i agree with it totally
client.o+3	( i've got a ) i've got a severe drug problem
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	( um ) could you tell me a little bit more about that
-	-
client.fn	what do you wanna know
client.fn	i mean i use cocaine every day
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( um ) except for probably the last three days because i was in the hospital
client.fn	and now they got me in ( a ) a rest home trying to recuperate because they still don't know what's going on with me
counselor.fa	oh okay
client.r+3	( um ) i'm ( di* ) yeah i'm diabetic and my blood sugars have been they won't even read on my machine they're so high
counselor.fa	oh
counselor.fa	hm
client.r+3	and they can't get them down which i know it has to do with drugs
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i've been using drugs ( um ) since i was probably thirteen years old cocaine
client.fn	( um ) i've been using them using cocaine every day since i was probably twenty_one about ten years ago
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	( um ) i know you really ( c* ) looking at me you probably can't tell
client.fn	a lot of people don't believe me by looking at me because i've got all my teeth and i keep pretty clean cut and all that
client.o+3	but ( i'm a ) i'm a heavy user [clears throat]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i used to use heroine i used to be a heroine junkie pretty bad
client.fn	i got clean off that
client.r+4	because i seen too many of my friends die from it
-	-
counselor.quo	okay so when did you get clean off of that
client.fn	and it's
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) about a year ago last not this previous last summer but the summer before it's a little over a year maybe ( um )
-	-
counselor.af	well congratulations that's impressive
client.fn	thank you
-	-
client.r-a3	yeah but ( uh ) i ( c* ) i just can't leave the cocaine alone
client.r-a3	i can't ( say ) stay away from it
-	-
counselor.quo	what are some of the things that you like about cocaine
-	-
client.r-3	i guess i think i use it ( um uh i ) i got severe depression
client.r-3	i think i use the cocaine to medicate myself to self medicate
client.r-3	to take away the pain of my childhood
client.r-3	( um ) my depression my worries my sadness
client.r-3	( um ) the things i've done wrong to my family just all that
-	-
counselor.res	so the cocaine kinda helps you feel a little bit better
counselor.res	sort of helps forget some of the things that you were talking about
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	okay ( um ) have you ever ( um ) taken any medication for depression before or
-	-
client.fn	yeah it never really worked though at least that i could tell it wasn't working for me i've tried it [sniffs] but yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	and so are there any other things that you've found that you have liked about using cocaine
-	-
client.r-d3	i just ( it's ) i mean it's fun
client.r+d3	i well no i can't say it's fun because it's not fun there's nothing fun about using drugs
client.r-d3	( um ) i guess while you're using it it's fun
client.r+3	but coming down
client.r+3	and the mission of getting it
client.r+3	coming up with the money to get it
client.r+d3	and it's not fun
client.r+d3	but ( i ) i just ( i i ) i don't like using i mean there really is nothing that i like using about it
client.r-3	but it's like all i know is to use
counselor.fa	hm
client.r-3	that's my body craves it
client.r+d3	and ( i ) i yeah there really is nothing i like using i don't like using yeah i don't there's nothing yeah
-	-
counselor.res	and from what you would say were saying though that you've also been using pretty heavily for almost a year ( so ) so
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( at ) at first it was fun
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	maybe the ( first ) first year or two
client.r+d3	but not there's nothing fun ( the* ) there's nothing i enjoy about it now
client.r-3	it's just ( like ) a part of life it's all i know is to use and get high
counselor.fa	hm
client.r-3	and it like i said it's ( self ) self medication
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm so whereas once before it was ( kinda ) more fun and recreational now it's something that you're ( kinda ) having a hard time knowing any other way to sort of
-	-
client.fn	any other way of life
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r-3	that's yeah i don't know any other way of life
-	-
counselor.res	okay well so you had mentioned quitting heroine
counselor.quc	( um ) have you ever tried to quit coke before
-	-
client.fn	no i wasn't on heroine that long
client.fn	so i mean ( it was ) it was easier to quit heroine
client.fn	( um ) but ( i ) i was only on heroine for maybe a year and a half so but yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	no ( i've ) i've tried to quit using i guess cocaine
client.o-3	but it just [nvv] somehow it falls in my lap or somehow i go back to it or something yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	do you have ( um ) a lot of friends or a lot of people that you know that use pretty heavily
-	-
client.r-3	all my friends
client.r-3	( every* ) everybody except for my family members ( everybody ) uses coke everybody
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like also kind of being in that environment of pretty heavy using as well might make it difficult
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r-3	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.res	and so ( um ) even though i mean you had said that you weren't using heroine for too long
counselor.af	i mean i still think it's ( um ) really awesome that you were able to quit
counselor.quo	were there some what were some of the things that you were able to do ( um ) to help you quit
-	-
client.fn	( um ) i was in treatment and i kicked heroine in treatment
client.fn	and then ( i ) i left i actually ended up leaving treatment early and i just never went back to it
client.fn	it was like i quit and i didn't have i didn't ( um ) it was more of a maintenance when i was using to at the end it was ( to you know ) to maintain out of habit
client.fn	and i just didn't have a habit anymore i was clean from it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so i wasn't craving ( uh ) heroine to get high i was craving heroine from not being dope sick
client.fn	and then since i had kicked and wasn't gonna be dope sick anymore i just didn't want the heroine
client.r+d4	i still don't i still don't even
-	-
counselor.rec	so it's pretty much out of your system for good the real craving
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah i my best friend he's he sells it and uses it heavily
client.fn	and i was ( like ) hanging out with him for a long time and then my cousin came up for from california
client.fn	and he sold it and used it for a long time and i was living with him so it was like it was there every day for free
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and uh that's how i got hooked on it just because ( you know ) it was just being handed to me every day
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	and so are you currently working right now
counselor.res	or you had said you're at a respite home
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quc	for the past three days [du]
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quc	prior to that were you working or
-	-
client.fn	no no [nvv] nope i can't work i got my ankle my joint's titanium
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i yeah it's i don't know if you can see the scar
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	but i used to race motocross and my ( my ) bones that's where my bones came out and my foot was facing
counselor.fa	hm
client.fn	yeah they wanted to amputate it but they were able to save it
client.fn	but i can't stand on it too long
client.fn	and then from my depression i just it makes it hard to ( uh ) even get out of bed some days
-	-
counselor.su	yeah depression can be really difficult
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.res	so you had mentioned ( um ) obviously that you feel like there really isn't anything good about ( um ) or any benefits that you've seen in your life from drug use you had mentioned
client.o+3	no
-	-
client.o+3	there is no benefits anybody that says there is benefits they're liars because there isn't there really isn't
counselor.fa	hm
client.r-d3	i mean when i'm getting high yes ( i ) i like to get high
client.r+d3	but i don't like to use
client.o+3	i ( i ) don't know if i'm ( s* s* ) saying this the right way i mean there is no yeah there's no benefits [laughs] anyone that says there is they're liars
client.fn	now i do know of some people that can take it or leave it and use
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) like my dad if i have when i go out to visit him he lives out in olympia
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( um ) i mean he'll sometimes get high with me but he can take it or leave it i mean he can ( do ) do a hit and ( uh ) say he's done me
client.r-a3	( i i ) i don't got that in me i can't take one hit and say i'm done it's if i'm on chasing and chasing and chasing until i'm just worn out or
-	-
counselor.quc	and when you say take a hit do you mean cocaine or marijuana
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.fn	cocaine cocaine yeah crack
counselor.res	cocaine
counselor.res	crack
client.fn	i guess yeah yeah i smoke and sometimes ( i ) i go out to olympia just to get away because there i don't know where to find any drugs out there so i get a little package and i'll go out there and ( use ) use with my dad until it's gone
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	and then stay out there for a week and ( try to ) try to get clean but then i'm always headed back out here to seattle
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm and so it's it sounds like what you're saying is that you've seen ( like ) the cost ( kind of ) to your health ( um ) and obviously the financial aspect you had mentioned really briefly and ( um ) even though there is that benefit of it sort of in the moment feeling a little bit better ( that ) that the long-term consequences sort of outweigh that much more
-	-
client.o+3	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	so at this point ( um ) if you had to put it on like a one to ten scale ( um ) how important would it be for you right now do you think to ( um )
-	-
client.fn	quit
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah
-	-
client.o+3	it's the most important thing
client.fn	ten as being the most important
-	-
counselor.gi	yes
counselor.st	[laughs] i should have told you that [du]
client.o+3	yeah ( uh i )
-	-
client.o+3	if i could say a hundred i'd say a hundred
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.o+3	( um ) yeah it's i'm kinda using this respite ( to ) to an advantage of hopefully maybe i ( you know )
client.ts+3	i've been clean for the last three days
client.o+3	so if i can stay clean and ( uh ) hopefully they can get me into a program ( you know ) that i'll be staying
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+3	there's a lot of doors opening there so hopefully they can get me through something
-	-
counselor.af	that's great
counselor.quo	how has it felt for the past three days being clean so far
-	-
client.r+3	feels good being clean
client.fn	( my body you know ) my body i'm still feeling like garbage from whatever bug i've got in me
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+3	( uh ) but mentally it feels good to be clean mentally yeah most definitely
-	-
counselor.af	that's awesome
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	and ( um ) have you talked to them at the respite center about ( um ) when you leave ( um ) kinda seeing about treatment options or [du]
client.fn	briefly
-	-
client.fn	briefly i haven't really been this is ( like ) yesterday i had to go to the doctor's appointment where i'm at met ( na* ) naomi or naomi[err] or whatever
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( um ) i was barely able to get out of bed to make it to that and this is ( like ) i'm starting to feel a little bit better so
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i've really just they briefly like come in my room and hey how you doing you're still alive i saw a social worker yesterday for like two minutes
counselor.fa	hm
client.fn	so but i mean yeah briefly we've talked about it and they're gonna we're gonna figure something out i know they've said that
client.fn	so but [coughs] they're just waiting for me to get more energy to actually have a good conversation
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm it makes a lot of sense because it sounds like maybe getting your health back first and then being able to check in with them and
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	so similar question on a one to ten scale if you had to rate ( um ) how confident you are right now about being able to quit what number would you give it
client.nc	[coughs] [clears throat]
-	-
client.r+a3	confident it's fifty_fifty so i'd say a five
client.r-d3	because i'm craving it
client.ts+3	( um ) i actually i had some money and i actually went to the shell station next door to ( where ) where i'm at and blew it all today
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	because i was craving and i knew i was coming i had to go down to pioneer's_square and then i had to come around this neighborhood and i knew if i had money in my pocket there's no way i'd have made it back there without buying some dope
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.ts+3	so i actually went and blew all my money just so i wouldn't ( uh ) at a shell station [laughs] at that but yeah i blew all my money ( um ) just so i wouldn't buy some drugs ( um )
client.o+3	so ( you know that's ) that's a big step for me
client.ts+3	( i ) i noticed i did that and ( you know ) it was in the back of my head all right ( grab grab it ) grab i had eighty bucks so it's like grab eighty bucks and after you're done with all your appointments and i was just like all right i can't do it i can't do it so
-	-
counselor.af	yeah well i mean that shows the a huge level of self-awareness and self-restraint
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	i mean to be able ( to ) to do that ( you know ) and to ( ha* ) to recognize what some triggers might be and be able ( to ) to kind of stop the triggers in the tracks ( on ) on your own
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.res	so you're saying that you're kind of on that cusp right now of about a five
counselor.quo	and what do you think it would take ( um ) for you to give it a little bit higher of a number
-	-
client.o+3	a couple more days of just working at it and getting brain straight
counselor.nc	[laughs]
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so the longer that you go without having it in your system you're noticing more clarity
-	-
client.r+3	yeah yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	okay and ( um ) how long are you gonna be at the respite center for
-	-
client.fn	i have no idea
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	they don't even know
-	-
counselor.fa	hm
-	-
client.fn	they're still we're still not sure what's going on with me so
client.fn	i am starting to feel a little bit better but i'm not able to eat yet or keep any food down or fluids or anything
counselor.fa	hm
-	-
counselor.res	and you said this is related to your diabetes
-	-
client.fn	( um ) we're thinking so we're not sure what's going on
counselor.fa	hm
client.r+1	( um ) we know my blood sugar's been they're over six_hundred because i'm the machine they go hey your on the glucometer only goes up to six_hundred and then it just starts reading high and that's what it's been reading is high so
-	-
counselor.quc	and have you had any problems similar to this before in the past or is this
-	-
client.fn	the first time
-	-
counselor.res	okay ( um ) and you had mentioned before that you think there might be also something ( um ) related to drug use and affecting that as well
-	-
client.r+3	i think the drug use has caused this
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r+3	caused my body to ( uh ) do whatever it's doing
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.af	all right well it sounds like you have a lot of clarity a lot of self-awareness
counselor.rec	( um you know ) you're able to recognize that the short-term consequences ultimately or the short-term doesn't the pleasure short-term of using ultimately doesn't necessarily ( um ) [nvv] have the benefits of the long-term consequences
-	-
client.o+3	right
-	-
counselor.rec	( um ) and that you're at a place right now where you're able to kind of stay away from it sounds like maybe potential ( um ) triggers
-	-
client.o+3	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	and getting healthy which is great
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	and again i mean i think ( you know ) it's really impressive that you were able to quit heroine
counselor.af	it's really impressive that you had ( um you know ) the wherewithal today to know that you had a little money in your pocket and to kind of stop yourself
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	so well ( um ) did you have any other questions for me or
-	-
client.fn	nope
-	-
counselor.gi	okay i mean this is pretty much all it is is just kind of a conversation so
-	-
client.fn	all right
-	-
counselor.st	( um ) would it be okay with you if i follow up in a week's time and give you a call and just kinda check in and see how you're doing
counselor.st	and see how you're feeling about the conversation if anything at all

counselor.quc	do you have any questions about your little interview with chloe yesterday
client.fn	oh
-	-
client.fn	well all the questions was like where is she
client.fn	i mean ( we you know like um ) she was really ( um ) trying to get people and ( uh ) she was working very hard to do it
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	and that was [du] just to go ahead on it
client.o+7	because it's about time for me to quit anyway ( you know ) after years of substance abuse
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.o+2	but just weed has always been
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+1	and maybe alcohol too
client.fn	so i'm gonna ( you know ) [du]
client.o-1	hasn't impeded anything
client.r+1	but it has taken money that i might have needed to use for other things
counselor.fa	ah
-	-
counselor.res	so money is one consideration huh
client.fn	mm
counselor.rec	( so um ) okay so you're okay with talking to me ( about ) about those things
-	-
client.fn	of course
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so you mentioned ( it ) it's about time to quit and the money is a consideration for you
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	we're talking ( like thirty ) thirty some years of history
counselor.res	oh thirty years huh
client.fn	yeah so ( you know ) we're talking years ( you know )
client.r+7	so ( it's ) this thing got old this is really old
-	-
counselor.res	it's getting old for you
-	-
client.r+2	yeah god knows how many jobs i probably didn't get because of the fact that i had to take this test you know what i mean
client.o+2	so it has affected my life in a negative way it definitely has
client.fn	because being a carpenter i had to i learned about all the cloaking things that you can do to cloak this weed
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) you could use goldenseal and all that and i played all those games
counselor.fa	ah
client.fn	and i got on jobs
client.fn	but at the same time i'm still doing it
client.r+2	so ( you know ) at the end of it it takes its toll
client.r+2	( you know ) it burns out certain nutrients in your body it takes away certain vitamins deficiencies that you have to doing it
client.r+2	and it also affects short-term memory and my short-term memory is pretty much shot
-	-
counselor.fa	is it
-	-
client.o+2	( so ) yeah so those are things that i know that it's time for me to quit it's really time
client.r+2	because i actually had i'm no longer just doing it to get high i'm just doing it to feel normal okay
client.r+2	and so ( i i ) i'm better off without it and so i'm having times ( of ) now where i'm feeling better without it at all
counselor.fa	really
-	-
client.r+2	yeah i'm doing ( more ) more in my thinking process
counselor.af	good good
client.r+2	and my senses are not dull
-	-
counselor.quc	how long has ( that ) this been now john that you've made this little decision and
-	-
client.fn	it's been kind of a wind-down thing for the last two years
counselor.quc	consciously
-	-
counselor.res	last two years
-	-
client.fn	yeah been kind of a wind-down thing
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( you know ) spacing it out and ( you know going ) trying to go every other day instead of every day and ( different )
client.r+2	it's been ( like ) a process that i'm just kinda like at sixty_one years old
client.fn	my birthday just came a couple days ago the twentieth of march
client.r+2	that ( it's just some it's ) it's just time
-	-
client.fn	( okay ) and so since this program came along
client.o+2	i said well ( you know maybe i need it you know ) maybe i need it too
client.r-2	because ( um ) usually when i stop doing it it comes to me free
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.r-2	and i'll stop and it comes to me free
counselor.res	free huh
client.r-2	some kind of way it comes to me free
client.r-2	and when it does ( i don't i never ) i always take it ( i alw* ) you know what i mean i never
counselor.su	it's hard it's hard huh
-	-
counselor.su	i mean it's there and it's free
client.r-2	it comes free
-	-
client.r-2	so that's the part that's bothering me that
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
counselor.quc	does that happen often
-	-
client.fn	( um ) not really not really most of the time you have to pay you know
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
client.r+2	and then you it's a criminal process of buying it it's a criminal thing ( you know ) act to buy it
client.o-2	but i've never possessed enough to get more than a ticket
-	-
client.o-2	( you know ) that's probably all i could get
client.o-2	i've never even had a whole ounce i've always had an eighth of an ounce [du]
counselor.fa	oh okay
client.fn	and that costs forty dollars
client.o-2	so i've never ( you know ) needed more than an eighth of an ounce i've never carried
client.o-2	so that would be a ticket that's all it would be is a ticket ( okay ) and a slap on the wrist you know
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.r+2	i mean that's all it would be so but ( it's ) i'm kinda tired of it okay
client.r+2	( it's not you know it's just ) it's getting old okay
client.r+2	i'm sixty_one okay man i don't know nobody else sixty_one years old [laugh] smoking weed come on
-	-
counselor.quo	( um ) could i ask ( um ) what types of things you've been doing to try to cut down as you have the last couple years
client.fn	uh
-	-
client.r+2	okay first of all money ( okay the tight ) the tightness of money with everyone okay we're in a depression
client.fn	and they want to call it a recession
client.r+2	but it's a depression for people who are not working okay so
-	-
counselor.rec	so just out of necessity
client.r+2	i don't
-	-
client.r+2	i can not afford it okay
client.fn	do you understand
client.r+2	the forty dollars has to be paid towards some food ( or ) or some rent
client.r+2	and the guilt behind me getting this and then i see the food kinda like [inhale audibly] [du]
counselor.su	that's that is important yeah
client.fn	it's only me and my wife now
-	-
client.fn	my children my children are out ( you know ) growing on their own
counselor.fa	is it
client.r+2	but i still feel it and i can see it in her eyes that it's time to quit
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	so yeah
client.r+2	i can s* i can see it in her eyes
-	-
counselor.rec	so out of financial necessity it's not as if you're doing anything but it's just [du]
client.fn	yes
client.fn	no
client.r+2	body-wise too
-	-
client.r+2	( memory ) short-term memory
client.r+2	when i can't remember something that i just thought of ( you know ) that just came up two hours ago you know what i mean
counselor.fa	really
counselor.fa	really
client.r+2	i know that over the years it's been taking a toll out of me
client.r+2	( you know ) i mean the hunger from the weed ( i'm ) i'm obese behind the hunger from the weed from eating too much
-	-
client.r+2	i'm obese from that ( you know ) two_hundred_and_eighty_four pounds ( you know ) i'm six foot one
client.r+2	( uh ) this is a lot of negatives ( a lot of ) it's just a lot of consistent negatives
client.r+n2	( that that ) that i just finally just determined that i just gotta do this i gotta ( get ) let this go
-	-
counselor.rec	wow so you've thought about this and you've made that choice that it's time
client.c+2	i i decided to quit
-	-
client.fn	i'll pee in a bottle for you and show you
counselor.fa	um
client.c+2	i mean i decided i'm gonna quit
client.r+2	because ( i ) number one i don't have the money to afford this
client.r+2	number two it's taken a toll ( over years ) over the years
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o-2	it hasn't made me go rob anything or go violent or anything like that because
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
counselor.fa	so
client.r+2	but it made me think i needed to sleep and i don't
-	-
counselor.res	you need to sleep
-	-
client.fn	yeah that's how i tricked myself
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	and that's not ( you don't want to have to l* you don't want to live ) you don't want to live like that yeah
client.fn	no
-	-
client.r+2	not anymore i don't need it to sleep
-	-
counselor.rec	so it's almost not as if you have to do anything in particular to quit it's kind of like circumstances
-	-
client.o+2	a conscious decision
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah circumstances ( hap* ) are happening to you where ( you f* ) you do need to quit you feel you need to quit
client.fn	and i and i
-	-
client.fn	and i need to pick up [laugh] twenty_five or ( whatever ) whatever money you guys are gonna give me
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i need that for ( you know to ) to just exist which is
counselor.fa	really
client.fn	and ( you know ) my wife is ( like ) busting her butt on two or three jobs [du]
counselor.res	she's working a lot
-	-
client.fn	and i'm hurt so ( i'm you know ) i'm on social_security you know [du]
counselor.gi	i've heard of social_security
client.r+2	so watching her slave ( you know ) at all these jobs ( i feel ) i feel that it's my fault okay
counselor.fa	oh
client.r+2	( you know ) because had i not been smoking weed i could've went a couple times at a couple little jobs and passed the piss test and been more busy
-	-
client.r+2	so it's a guilt over the years to have a wife for thirty_something years or whatever how many years we've been together and she's still there with me through it thick and thin
client.r+2	i owe her i owe her i owe her to quit
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	and she's with you on this i take it
-	-
client.r+2	yes she is
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	yeah good good
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	( um it is ) it's a conscious decision like you mentioned we have to make
client.fn	mm
counselor.rec	and ( uh ) on top of that ( you know ) there's a lot of factors we don't have control over that that push that along that you mentioned
client.fn	yeah that's true
counselor.af	so ( um i i i ) i wish you well with this and uh participating in this study

client.r+2	i'm too old for this
counselor.fa	yeah

-	-
client.o+2	i mean i really know and i'm using god too to help me
client.r+2	because i know it's time to quit
-	-
counselor.quc	anything else need to happen for you to be successful in this john
client.fn	um

counselor.rec	so you have a teammate you have a teammate too
client.fn	mm
client.fn	uh
-	-
client.fn	she is my teammate ( okay ) yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	but ( i you know ) like i said i understand about the twelve step programs that you guys have ( you know ) like a_a twelve step program and all of that
client.fn	but i truly believe that i'm not that
client.fn	i mean i want to separate myself by saying that i'm not as much
client.o+2	but i know that i am okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+2	weed addiction and alcohol addiction ( they that ) that's me
client.fn	and ( um ) but i steer clear of heroin
client.r+3	and i tried cocaine before and i don't like ( uh the the the ) the speedy rush that it gives you
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-d7	i really like things that slow you down okay you know what i mean
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.res	like the marijuana
-	-
client.r+d7	yeah i don't like the speed thing
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
client.r+7	because i'm pretty hyper as a child anyway coming up i've been hyper all my life so ( like ) i couldn't even do coffee as a child
counselor.fa	wow
client.r+7	because i had anxiety ( uh ) before drugs or anything i was a child that had to take ritalin as a child coming up because i was a hyper child
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) so that's how i got started in my drug abuse is being a child taking ritalin
client.fn	and i recommend that they find another drug ( to make children ) to smooth children out
client.fn	i recommend i think probably medical science probably has a lot more things now ( and but ) than back in the day ( w* you know ) than giving them ritalin ( you know ) monkey tranquilizers or whatever they are ( you know ) what i mean
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.o+7	so ( um ) i don't blame anyone except myself because ( i ta* ) i accept full responsibility that i've done this
client.r+7	and that it has put my life into so to speak ( a a a a a ) a plateau of negatives you know what i mean
client.o+7	and i need to be more positive okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	yeah i can see that
client.r+7	it has ridden me into a i'm hitting this wall i feel like i'm
-	-
counselor.rec	where you can't move on yeah right
client.fn	right right
-	-
client.r+7	unless i quit ( you know ) unless i quit
client.c+7	so ( uh ) i'm there i'm there
counselor.fa	yeah okay
-	-
counselor.rec	you have a lot of compelling reasons john to quit
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+7	love for my wife is the number one
counselor.af	there you go
client.r+7	watching her work man she worked ( like ) three jobs three jobs man
counselor.quc	did do you
counselor.res	three jobs
client.r+7	i'm there sitting at the house gotta clean everything ( like ) cut trees in the yard but it's not enough
-	-
client.r+7	it's not enough i owe her better she deserves better
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+7	that's cool she deserves better though she deserves better and i'm gonna give it to her [du] ( you know ) she's a good woman
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) we raised our kids
client.r+7	my kids don't like it they know when dad's in the bathroom too long [laugh] they don't like it they never have
counselor.fa	really
client.fn	they don't do it ( okay ) so except my older boy i think he might have followed suit
-	-
client.fn	a little bit he works two jobs and still finds time to be illegal with something [du]
counselor.fa	oh really
client.fn	i don't know what the hell like you know like ( he's ) he calls himself some kind of cocaine seller guy or something
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	( you know ) i won't let him socialize with [du] the children [du] while i'm around him so
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
client.fn	we have a bad understanding
client.r+7	but see now that's kind of hypocritical ( you know ) if i don't want him to see his brothers and sisters and i'm seeing them [du] that's kind of hypocritical
counselor.fa	oh
counselor.res	you gotta
counselor.res	change yourself
client.r+7	i have to live with the guilt i have to do it by example not by just my mouth ( okay ) so it's just time ( you know ) it's time
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+7	( i wanna ) i wanna get back in the good graces of my son he's my older son he's named after me
counselor.fa	oh okay
client.r+7	so because he sees ( the hypocritic* you know ) the hypocrisy ( in ) in the whole thing and he feels it ( okay ) so ( we don't ) we're kinda distant
client.r+7	( you know ) so this would be the right thing to do at this time in my life
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.o+7	and whatever you have in this program if it can help out i'll try to adhere to it i'll pull it in and see what i can do to use it
client.o+7	( okay ) but i know that deep down it's gotta be me ( okay ) and i'm on it already ( you know ) [du]
counselor.res	it sounds like it
client.c+7	i'm a couple days without i got the money but ( i'm not ) you know i'm not gonna spend it on that
counselor.res	not using it
-	-
client.r+7	( you know i'm pay* ) i'm using that money to pay one of these late bills that we have coming
client.fn	( you know ) because we were in the ownership ( you know ) of a home because of her hard work and sacrifice
client.fn	mine was sporadic and periodical and one of my trades is like that
-	-
client.fn	i'm a carpenter so my trade is like that also so ( it ) it all fit
client.r+2	and i planned to work about six months i get laid off instead of moving on to another job i get laid back and collect unemployment and smoke weed [laugh] you know what i mean ( you know ) too much
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) so i ( um ) like said i that's about all i can tell you you know that's [du]
counselor.gi	[du] you've told
client.o+7	yeah i'm living what i'm saying ( you know ) that's all i can tell you is that i'm living exactly what i'm saying
counselor.fa	exa*
client.o+7	i'm not i'm not in it for no glory i don't want no i'm not in it for the for no pats on the back
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.quc	and are you still
-	-
client.r+7	it's time okay it's time ( okay )
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and so is there any questions you wanna ask me
counselor.af	you spoke volumes
-	-
counselor.af	no you spoke volumes
counselor.gi	and this is exactly ( you know h* a uh ) i'm looking to learn from you actually and we're looking to learn from you over ( the the ) the coming year
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	( um ) it's just we're looking to see ( where ) where you are at this time where you were and where you see yourself in the future
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	and you've made that very clear mm ( with com* ) like i said with very convincing very compelling reasons why ( uh ) you've made this decision ( uh ) to change
client.fn	and
counselor.gi	and ( uh ) that's what we're looking for the why's and the ( you know the ) the if's and the
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i started this stuff when i was a kid i was like about thirteen years old
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i was in the streets ( with ) with gang banger kids and we thought smoking weed was the really
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	( you know ) and then weed advanced the technology and ( the ) the agriculture and it advanced okay
counselor.fa	oh yeah
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	it was just weed back there ( you know ) colombian it was the only thing we knew our gold or something
client.fn	but then they get into these steps where there's advanced to stages of where they have ( you know you know ) this killer ( you know
client.fn	and ) and ( uh ) the criminal thing about it advanced also so ( um ) they got a weed ( that um ) that you can smoke and it's weed that you can smoke and ( uh ) one hit is supposed to be one-hit weed
-	-
client.fn	i've never had it but everybody's out there running to try to get this that's what they're looking for and they're not looking for
counselor.fa	wow
client.fn	and it's so smelly that ( you could ) if you had it in this room you could smell ( you know )
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	and the guys think that they can smoke it and chew some gum ( and and ) and walk around people and it don't be reeking ( okay )
counselor.res	it's gone
-	-
client.fn	( th* that's a real ) that's a misconception right there
client.r+2	because ( if it ) the smell is a distinct smell it smells like burning garbage okay that's what weed smells like to me burning garbage
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+3	the only thing that smells worse is crack hits smoking crack because that smells like burning medicine okay
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r+2	one smells like burning garbage
client.r+3	and one smells like burning medicine okay
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+3	so i wouldn't go into the crack thing because it's just again it's a speeder upper it's just yeah i wanna be laid back
counselor.res	yeah you're more mellow
client.r-1	( okay ) so now like wine and alcohol wine lays me back
counselor.rec	okay [du] yeah but now
client.fn	but it doesn't [du]
-	-
counselor.rec	but even now though that mellowness is not there's too many other things that come with it
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	so
counselor.su	so no i can understand so no ( i ) i can appreciate that so
client.r+2	you have to do yeah [du] that's right
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) i know a lot one week isn't ( uh you know ) a lot of time for things to change drastically
counselor.st	but if you don't mind i'd like to check in with you in about a week just to follow up on what we talked about today
client.fn	mm
client.fn	okay
client.fn	sure
counselor.st	and then chloe or jess will follow up with you on a longer term basis like every three months
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	right
-	-
client.fn	you guys got a good program going
client.fn	is this ( uh ) subsidized by the government or something like that
counselor.gi	it's a
-	-
counselor.gi	grant by ( um ) the national_institute_for_drug_ abuse
client.fn	okay now
-	-
client.fn	did you go to college ( or s* for ) for this kind of stuff or did you
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah ( i went to ) i went to u_w
-	-
client.fn	did you really you old dog
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
client.fn	now ( what's what's your what's your what you major ) what's your major
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	master_of_social_work uh-huh
client.fn	okay
-	-
client.fn	so now that's not a real paying profession is it
client.fn	i mean ( you know ) unless you get a certain position in in in in some kind of a
counselor.fa	exactly exactly exactly
client.fn	( so this ) you don't have a certain position yet right you're just climbing up the ladder so to speak or
-	-
counselor.gi	i'm actually ( i'm ) the supervisor of the clinics here
client.fn	oh
-	-
client.fn	you're established ( okay
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	you're you're ) you supervise it all that's good
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	and helping out on this study
-	-
client.fn	that little girl that ( uh ) what's her name the little girl that interviewed me yesterday
client.fn	i think she's a addition to your group she's a real beautiful person
counselor.af	great great
client.fn	( she's a uh ) she's sincere in her conviction toward trying to get people in here and uh she cares about the program
counselor.gi	she she um
counselor.gi	she works at it
-	-
counselor.gi	( she ) she plugs away she cares about the pro*
client.fn	( you're ) you're absolutely right
-	-
client.fn	it's not like ( you know ) it's a job to her
client.fn	it's more that she really wants people off drugs
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	she really does you can just see it
counselor.gi	she's um
-	-
counselor.gi	she's very earnest so yeah
client.fn	yes she is if you
-	-
client.fn	if you got a crew like that you guys will go a long way
counselor.gi	i'll pass
-	-
counselor.gi	that on to her john
counselor.af	i appreciate that
client.fn	you know and then the
-	-
client.fn	other one that was in there i thought that she was her
client.fn	because they just they they got a resemblance
counselor.res	they look alike yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	and they act alike
-	-
client.fn	do they really
client.fn	they got a resemblance
client.fn	and she ( was ) showed a genuine care and genuine concern
counselor.af	good good
client.fn	people in hospitals have a tendency to harden these doctors up by their theatrical animated ( uh ) behavior
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	( okay ) so doctors have to callus themselves ( you know )
-	-
client.fn	they don't have anything to do with the financial end
client.fn	but the people don't understand that so they're getting all irate
client.fn	there's a lot of people that come from prisons and stuff
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( you know ) and [du] they're irate so the doctors have callused themselves up
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	so when i see anybody that has a heart for something and they really give a damn ( okay ) i treasure that
counselor.af	great
client.fn	it took a lot of years for me to come to this though
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( okay ) to treasure the people that are good and stop ( you know ) making the people that are bad money to make big movies [laugh] ( okay ) you know what i mean
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	they get ( good ) good headlines and stuff stop headlining them in your heart headline the people that [du] okay
counselor.rec	that help you
client.fn	so that's what i do now and it's simple
counselor.af	that's a good thought
client.fn	my life was ( a ) a racist type of life at one time
client.fn	( you know ) we mad at white people for things that really was myself
client.fn	and i don't blame them anymore okay
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	but ( i like ) it's simple right now i like who likes me
-	-
client.fn	it's really simple ( okay the life ) i simplified my life made everything less complicated and less faceted ( you know )
client.fn	just almost from this gray area that's that's [du] yeah too much
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.res	you made it simple you made life simple
client.fn	too much gray area from yes to no from black to white from ( you know ) just too much gray area and so
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.nc	[laugh]
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
client.fn	it either is or it isn't
client.fn	which most of the times if you've got a percentage of to the is and the isn't got a percentage to the [du]
client.fn	( you know ) and ( like ) i can give you for instance ( uh ) the gay issue
client.fn	the gay issue of now i wouldn't mind the teacher if he's gay and he's teaching people and he keeps his personal life to his self okay
-	-
client.fn	it's when you try to sell people ( okay ) then you're open for whatever comes at you okay
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	[du] if you get gay bashed okay if you get bashed you don't want to open your mouth because sexually me and my wife or any other sexual act that i do is a private matter
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	okay now if you decide to throw that out there you get bashed okay you opened your mouth
counselor.res	you're fair game
counselor.fa	ahh
client.fn	( okay ) so if i got a child and he's in third grade and he's the only black person in that class and that gay teacher takes an interest in my child i might have difficulty deciphering what that interest is
client.fn	so i possibly knowing that he's the only black child in there i'd probably after i found out he was gay take him out of that class
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( i ) just because i don't afford to risk my child in case this guy is ( like maybe you know you know i ) i can't afford my child's life ( to ) to worry about it
client.fn	so i've learned over the years the sixty_one years okay that
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( uh ) i've been in prison before you know from robbing banks when i was twenty_one ( uh ) for twenty_four twenty_five years old ( uh )
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	i survived nobody made me a girl ( okay ) you know what i mean
client.fn	( uh ) i been through ( you know you know ) just ( you know ) life life has been it's been ( you know ) it hasn't been roses
counselor.res	yeah you got
client.fn	( i ) to be a carpenter i went to a four-year program and it took me seven years in a four-year program to get the same paper
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) it took me seven but i'm once i get myself to doing it
counselor.af	you did it
client.fn	but then i didn't realize ( that ) when i did it that the racism would be so overt ( so so so you know so uh calculated ) so calculated and so vindictive
client.fn	( okay ) that it would ( make me ) throw me off with myself ( okay ) and make me ( you know kind of like ) be my own worst enemy by sucking in all this hatred
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( okay ) do you understand what i'm saying so

client.fn	( okay ) and ( uh i just um ) i'm thankful for the little things ( that that ) that i've done ( you know that i ) that i participated in that make things better for others ( okay )
-	-
counselor.af	well you're kinda doing that here right now and i appreciate it
client.fn	okay
counselor.nc	so i'm gonna flip this off john
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.nc	and i'll just leave this right here
counselor.gi	so my name is matt and i'm a social worker here in the clinic
client.fn	okay
counselor.quc	and i want to ( um ) just ask you initially if lea had kinda gave you ( a ) an idea about ( what ) what's gonna happen here between you and i
client.fn	yes
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) she just said it would be a one_on_one
-	-
counselor.st	okay so yeah ( i and i want ) if it's okay with you what i'd like to ask that we talk about ( um ) is ( um ) your drug use and how you think that's going how you think ( uh ) it's affecting you ( how ) what's good about it what's bad about it
client.fn	uh
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah she did
counselor.st	just kinda want to talk about your impression of how it's working for you
-	-
client.fn	fine
counselor.gi	and uh
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	it's ( uh ) pretty much governed by my income so ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quo	what do you mean by that
-	-
client.r+7	( uh ) well because my income just got cut in half and excuse me and so i haven't been able to indulge in ( uh ) much use [laugh] or would you say recreational use
client.fn	( so you know ) and i would say that that's what i tell my nephews when my sister's told me things like oh they smoke so much pot they're not gonna do well in school
client.fn	so i usually tell them i go well if you like pot you better graduate so you can get a job so you can afford to do whatever you want
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) [laugh] i mean you've gotta you can't lose sight of the primary focus which is earn income then buy whatever you want
client.fn	but you have to work because ( you're not gonna have ) you're not gonna be able to steal and nobody ever last doing that so
-	-
counselor.res	so you advise your nephews to to get an education so they can earn money
client.fn	graduate school
client.fn	to get an education
-	-
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	well yeah i mean ( uh ) if they're gonna fail school and they're doing so much of this weed they're not gonna go anywhere
client.fn	and if they're thinking about being a little neighborhood dealer ( or nei* ) or whatever they're not gonna last so
counselor.rec	that's
-	-
counselor.rec	risky doing that
-	-
client.fn	yeah and no one ever buys a home and a nice car doing that
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( so ) [laugh] you never get that far [laugh]
-	-
counselor.res	so ( your ) your use ( um ) of recreational drugs ( is ) is dependent on how much you can afford to spend on it
-	-
client.o-2	as long as you don't lose sight of your primary focus which is to keep your job
client.r+2	my job requires a class_a driver's license requires random u_as
client.o-2	so i mean ( uh ) i have always considered my use to be recreational and ( uh ) governed by the time parameters that you can use it without being terminated at work sure
-	-
counselor.res	so maintaining your job is a priority for you
-	-
client.fn	of course yeah and which must maintain income
-	-
counselor.rec	so you're using them ( f* um ) and you're getting ( um ) a ( uh ) drug screen or ( having that ) having to do a drug screen ( is a ) is a risk yeah
client.r+2	( hampers ) hampers the use
-	-
client.r+2	right ( well ) well it actually hampers the use because we are random
client.fn	and ( uh ) being in a construction group i'm a [du] lineman i work on power lines so that we've always been known to be ( you know a rough you know ) a rough and tumble type people who
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( uh uh ) i mean it's not unusual for a lineman to drink three six_packs a night every night
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) i've never been in that category at all [laugh]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+a1	i just don't i've never been able to drink like that
client.r-1	but ( um ) i mean that's normal for a construction lineman probably construction ironworker probably construction woodsworker ( you know ) things like that so
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-7	( uh ) i've just never been to that degree i'm more of a weekend social type individual
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like ( you uh ) it's important to you ( to to maintain just ) just to maintain ( um ) some limits on the amount ( and ) ( and ) and how often ( you're ) you're using because of ( um ) [du]
client.fn	yeah
client.o+7	and how often yeah
client.r+7	you can't lose sight of the primary
-	-
counselor.fa	right right
client.r+7	goal which is to maintain the job home ect
client.fn	and ( uh ) the people that don't see that ( i don't ) i can't relate to at all
-	-
counselor.quo	tell me about ( your d* ) your drug use
-	-
client.fn	( um ) from the beginning
client.fn	( i mean it started off you know ) to be brief i mean it started at fifteen drinking beer ( uh ) it graduated to marijuana probably a year later
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( um uh ) i'd say d_o_c drug of choice marijuana
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( uh ) experimented with back in the day of course that's in the seventies when everything was well even the judges would say oh yeah everything's all right [laugh] practically
-	-
client.r+2	( you know ) and ( uh ) so ( uh ) then again it tapered off as the testing got intense for the class_a drivers back in the eighty eighty_nine ninety
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+2	( then ) then of course your use of marijuana drops off and you're increasing alcohol
client.r+1	which is actually worse because the alcohol is worse for you than one of the worst things through your system
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( so um ) so there's been shifts and swings ( you know ) throughout the lifetime ( in uh ) in usage and what is used ( um ) so
-	-
client.o-2	( uh ) and a lot of her questions i don't feel i have a habit
client.o-2	when they use the word habit i don't like that habit sounds like dependency sounds like addiction ( you know or that's not not ) to me that's not the case because
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.res	you're not
-	-
counselor.res	addicted
-	-
client.r+2	if i don't have the money i can't get it
client.o-2	i don't care ( you know ) i'm not gonna do anything more than wait for pay [laugh] ( than to g* ) to get anything
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and to hear the other people around me ( uh ) talk ( and ) and it's like i've got to have it i've got to have it ( you know ) i've got to pawn this pawn that ( it's like you know ) and then something's wrong
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) [laugh] ( y* y* y* you're you're ) you're putting ( too much uh ) too much attention or too much focus on that which is not the material aspects of what you're gonna be able to achieve ( you know ) acquire it so i don't i just
counselor.res	so if you're
-	-
counselor.res	( not ) if you don't have the money to purchase it ( it it you're ) you're okay with not using
client.o-2	no i'm fine
-	-
client.o-2	with it
client.fn	to me it's like what can i do [laugh] if i don't have it i don't have it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+2	( you know so ) and then i have to have rent i have to have electric and i have to have everything else ( you know ) so ( um )
-	-
counselor.res	so all of those things are priorities ( to ) to marijuana to purchasing marijuana
client.r+2	oh yeah
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	yeah ( um ) it looks like ( uh y* y* ) you've checked a couple other things here like ( um ) methamphetamines ( and ) and ( um ) sedatives ( um )
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	i've always had since i've been eleven or twelve had a hard time sleeping i don't know why
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+d3	( um ) growing up in miami i never really cared about coke i hated coke the effects and the paranoia and ect
client.r-5	methamphetamine doesn't really do that
-	-
client.fn	( um uh ) i had one woman that was i know she didn't ever try it she was about seventy_eight very spry a well_off woman but she had a son that was arrested for it several times
client.fn	and ( uh ) she mentioned something that i've never heard any coworker and ( uh ) person my age any abuser anyone has never mentioned it
client.fn	and ( i ) i asked her i said well maybe he'll get drug court or something like that and she goes no it's about his fourth time
-	-
client.fn	she goes i know she's never tried any drug in her life a very active hiker and everything and ( uh ) she goes well it's just so pleasurable the [laugh] methamphetamine
client.fn	and i said [du] i said i've never heard anybody [laugh] say that before i said you're right but i've never heard anybody say that before
client.fn	it sounded like she meant it in a sexual manner ( you know ) ( she said ) yeah she goes well it's just so pleasurable
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-5	and i did find that to be true
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o-5	but ( uh uh ) the cravings the things like that i don't i've never acquired
client.r-5	( uh ) i think it's due to the job i've had i mean when you're climbing steel towers that are two_hundred feet and you're climbing poles and you're working on five_hundred_thousand volts and under ( um ) believe me every intoxicant is out of your system sweated out of your system by nine o'clock in the morning ( you know ) so ( uh ) it just
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.rec	sounds like
-	-
counselor.rec	you have a risky job
-	-
client.fn	it is ( and it's a hard ) but it's a hard_balling job
client.fn	i mean ( uh uh ) like i say when i have modified ( um ) talking to a nurse that's involved with the company that i'm being hired for and i've said well i only drink ( like ) thursday which is generally true
client.r+1	i mean now that i have the acid reflux in my stomach very bad i only drink ( like ) maybe ( friday saturday ) thursday friday saturday something like that because it does tear it up
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and even the prilosec i take every day tears it up
-	-
client.fn	but even when i said thursday friday ( they ) they'd say oh my gosh that's so much and i'm like man you don't know linemen you know [laugh] ( i said ) i said
client.r-7	( you know there are ) even though it's a dangerous job it's i don't know why but it feels like when ( you ) you're off you wanna just go [nvv] ( you know ) because you have been focused and concentrated the whole time ( you know ) so
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah ( that's ) yeah
-	-
client.r+7	( you know i mean it does ) it sounds contradictory like gee that's stupid to be getting high like that
client.o-7	but i mean yeah not many people would wanna do it in any way ( you know ) so
counselor.rec	it sounds like a
-	-
counselor.rec	risky job where you'd wanna be able to have your ability to focus and maintain your judgment yeah
client.fn	well
-	-
client.fn	for guys that drink that was the big thing when i came up here
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( uh ) the east coast and the west coast as far as ( cer* ) certainly linework and working conditions the west is about thirty thirty_five years behind the east coast
client.fn	i mean the east coast drinking was out a long time ago
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) snohomish county p_u_d i was working for them and ( uh ) i was assistant training coordinator and i hear this well we're deciding on whether to barricade ( the t* ) the worksite from the public or to ground the trucks
client.fn	and i had to say yeah that's a good ( i* ) what and they're saying yeah we're leaving it up to the foreman leaving it up to the foreman i said grounding the trucks was mandatory back east in nineteen_sixty_nine and this is ninety_six
client.fn	i said so something's wrong here i said something's really wrong
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	or ( you know ) washington are very for the worker democratic states ( for the em* ) for the workers but ( uh ) that's idiotic to leave it up to the [laugh] ( you know )
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	that stuff doesn't happen in the south and the florida_power_and_light is like an industry leader and they'll say you will ground the trucks definitely or you're not taking them
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) so i mean to me ( it it was uh ) it was amazing that so these guys when i got there in ( ninety ) ninety_four they said they had just got rid of having beer six_packs not on the truck up in the air in the bucket truck [laugh]
counselor.fa	wow
client.r+1	and i'm like well alcohol is a physical inhibitor
-	-
client.r+1	i mean it actually inhibits your muscles
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	( you know ) where marijuana on the other hand when i was young as an apprentice climbing poles and everything marijuana made an ignorant job interesting
client.fn	( you know ) because ( i ) i guess should have gone to college and stuff like that i didn't want to at the time
client.r-2	but i mean it actually makes you interested in a stupid job
client.fn	( you know ) which the linework is pretty basic as long as you've got the common sense to know things or understrain not to touch this and ( you know ) not to be you know what i'm saying
counselor.rec	yeah there are there are some
-	-
counselor.rec	some inherent risks
-	-
client.fn	yeah [laugh] but i mean ( you know ) i'll tell you ( when i'm ) when i'm moving wire energized wire or something and i've got a guy that's concentrated and focused that's scary
counselor.rec	you have to be careful yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( you know c* ) because i'll still kid around and he'll go oh no no no or come on i mean we're moving
client.fn	and i'm like wow if you find this difficult that difficult then what's happened in your career [laugh] ( you know ) have you burned things down and had to you know what i'm saying
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) so ( you know it it ) you've got to have some kind of what they brashinists or something like that a brash kind of attitude that
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
client.fn	and you also rely on your physical which is a mild crisis now because i am disability retired and it's like ( you know ) i've always been ( you know in you know ) invincible or we always think we're invincible because who's gonna work on two_hundred foot towers and climb them and then work on ( five_hundred volts ) energized five_hundred_thousand volts
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) and i mean so it's like you get an attitude where ( you know ) you're ( like ) invincible
client.fn	and then when you start to break down physically and through age then you're like damn ( you know uh ) i'm not ( you know ) [laugh] so
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	it's got to change your mindset a little bit yeah
-	-
client.fn	it doesn't depress me or anything but ( uh you know ) it just ( you know ) it doesn't get me depressed i never even think of that word depressed
client.fn	but i mean ( it ) it puts yeah a stop in you and so
-	-
counselor.quc	so ( of of these ) of these drugs that you've identified that you've used ( which are ) are any of them or which of them ( um ) do you find ( um ) concerning
counselor.quc	are there any ( that ) that are more concerning than the others or
-	-
client.fn	probably [laugh] only the ( uh ) omeprazole for my acid [laugh] reflux
client.fn	because sometimes i'll take that twice a day and then ( uh ) if i overeat it just kind of ( uh it ) i don't know the acid still comes and i think damn
counselor.fa	oh okay
counselor.fa	oh okay
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) and i tried to ask the doctors here and the ( gastrointerol* ) interologists ( you know ) they say well the omeprazole shuts down the acid pump and i go yeah but why
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i'm sure it's pumping the acid to ( uh ) digest the food so ( why you know ) why are you gonna shut it down and if it's shutting it down what's that gonna do to the food that's not getting digested
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) i mean ( you know ) there's a series of questions that i wanna know the basics to ( and uh ) and i don't get answers
counselor.res	you
client.fn	so i mean the problem with them
-	-
counselor.rec	well you're concerned about a prescription drug
-	-
client.fn	[laugh] yeah
-	-
counselor.quo	but what about these drugs that you're using recreationally
client.fn	well
-	-
client.fn	i was gonna touch on the sleeping part
client.r+d3	i mean ( uh ) i never have liked cocaine growing up in miami i mean ( it just ) it's a paranoia and drop
client.fn	i can't lose sleep i never have wanted to lose sleep because i can't go to work
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	( you know ) so ( uh ) i used to like quaaludes until they were completely outlawed because it was more of a hypnotic and you could actually take it and stay awake and you would be numbed out and it was and you could sleep that night [laugh]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but ( uh you there's ) they're nowhere in the world today
client.fn	so the seroquel and things like that
client.r-4	and some of the painkillers of course now for my back after i had a bad fall ( you know ) they're taken randomly
client.o-4	they're not abused
client.fn	but ( uh you there's ) they're nowhere in the world today
client.fn	so the seroquel and things like that
client.r-4	and some of the painkillers of course now for my back after i had a bad fall
-	-
client.r-4	( uh ) i find it easier to buy them than to get a doctor to prescribe them ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and even though they have pain management today and supposedly ( they m* ) they prescribe them freely or ( or you know ) not so difficultly
client.r-4	but i don't know i've never found a doctor for that so that's why i engage in that
client.r-8	and then the seroquel is just for sleeping because i've always had problems sleeping so
-	-
counselor.quc	the seroquel
-	-
client.r-8	seroquel is like a anti-convulsant or something like that but i use it just to sleep because i think i nibbled one one time and just flopped down like a stunned salmon ( you know ) and so [laugh] that was the only thing that i've ever noticed ( that ) that just bam you're out
counselor.fa	oh
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	even though i've seen guys ( uh ) just for traffic stuff when i'm in jail the district county i see guys take three in the morning three three_hundred seroquels and come bopping down during lunch ( you know ) and i go you sold those right or traded those they go no [laugh] i took them i go you've got to be shitting me [laugh]
-	-
counselor.quc	this is in jail
-	-
client.fn	[laugh] yeah i said three three_hundreds i said ( you've got to be out of ) you've got to be kidding me
client.fn	i mean ( you know ) i nibble on one of them and i just boom you're out ( you know ) so
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	( what do you d* uh ) were you in jail
counselor.quo	or what do you do in jail
counselor.quc	are you
-	-
client.fn	oh it's just for ( you know ) d_u_i or something like that ( you know )
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	so ( um ) i'm just saying when i've been there
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( uh ) never been in prison or anything like that no no ( um )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	is that something that happens on a regular basis
-	-
client.fn	no no no ( i stopped getting huh ) i stopped getting d_u_is about twenty years ago about twenty years ago
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	oh okay
client.r+1	yeah i just it's not a good idea so and i agree with it i mean
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah ( it's that's a ) that's a big risk
-	-
client.fn	a progressive country like sweden when the second one is life in prison no [laugh]
counselor.gi	yeah you don't
counselor.gi	no
counselor.gi	[du]
client.r+1	because you've got to understand that that's a bad thing to do ( you know ) so
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	so ( are you ) do you currently use methamphetamines
-	-
client.r+5	( uh ) no because of money i don't have it i can't afford it now yeah [laugh]
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.res	because of money
-	-
counselor.rec	so you would if you had the money
-	-
client.o-5	i would ( i i ) i ( uh ) have a girlfriend over and i'll have a couple drinks
counselor.res	and
client.o-5	( and ) and i only ( s* ) smoke it i never did i used to snort it only
-	-
client.fn	but ( uh ) i have a problem where ( i've always ) i've always gone out with young girls always young single women all my life
client.fn	( you know ) so as i've gotten older i continue it ( you know ) and whether we have a financial arrangement or whatever i mean they'll even move in with me and things like that
client.r-5	but i mean ( uh ) in that respect it is pretty i mean i never did smoke it but they would and ( uh ) so i did smoke it
-	-
client.r-5	i said ( you know ) this stuff's only for sex if you smoke it i said that's all it's for i said
client.fn	because they would say oh leave me some because i've got to wake up in the morning and i go well then snort it oh no no no ( i ) no i'll smoke it i go well that doesn't wake you up [laugh]
client.r-5	so i mean but i said that's only for sex
client.r-5	but it is quite incredible [laugh] to smoke it
counselor.rec	so you
-	-
counselor.rec	( you you ) when you can afford it you use meth
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) probably twice a month
counselor.res	[du] okay
client.fn	yeah probably twice a month
-	-
counselor.rec	and it really ( you you ) you find it that it increases ( the ) the pleasure
client.r-d5	oh it's
-	-
client.r-d5	( in go* uh ) ungodly
client.fn	( uh ) i've never the coke i've tried ( you know ) i've done maybe about a year straight in my lifetime sometime years ago it's all right
client.r-5	but i mean the meth is like something you've never even
client.fn	that's why i was so shocked when that woman said that because i know she's never tried it but i mean [laugh] i was amazed that she said that i've never heard anyone say that
client.r-5	but it's true
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r-5	i mean it is a intense orgasm
client.fn	and ( uh ) i can see where people ( uh ) some of the people in tacoma ( it's like how they're what a place to ) what a place to be
client.fn	because i mean those people they can't get up or do anything unless they have it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( you know they always ) they always tell me well if i don't have any i'm sleeping ( you know ) and i'm like they go i can't
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) that to me to admit that to yourself would be sad ( you know )
client.fn	and ( uh ) i mean if you can't get up unless you have something anything then you're in trouble ( you know ) you're in serious trouble so [laugh] ( uh )
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so you've known people who ( have ) you feel like have used methamphetamines used meth ( and ) and have gotten in trouble with it
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah
-	-
counselor.res	yeah ( uh do you sa* uh you're y* ) you really enjoy ( the ) the sexual pleasure that you get when using meth
counselor.quc	is there something that you don't like about it
counselor.quo	or ( what ) what's bad about it ( is there ) if anything
-	-
client.r+5	well ( it uh ) it requires ( it it ) it eats away at the calcium in your system which ( it's gonna draw ) the closest it's going to draw from is your teeth and i ( had all my ) had all my teeth [laugh]
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	so ( uh ) in the last and i haven't used it for years at all i mean it's all probably been maybe two years of occasional use
client.r+5	and i've had some bad decay which concerns me so those are pretty bad drawbacks ( um )
counselor.res	so you've
-	-
counselor.res	had some teeth that have decayed
-	-
client.r+5	i had some decay that decayed very oddly ( you know ) like boom plops out [laugh] ( you know ) and i'm like what the ( you know )
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	because i've got all my teeth i've had six cavities all my life ( you know ) i've had nothing no dentures or anything
client.r+5	so ( uh ) and my friend was explaining it ( uh ) draws at the softest ( uh ) calcium deposits and draws away from that from your body ( so ) and that's why i kinda shy away from it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+5	( uh ) sometimes i like my income being cut in half because i can't afford it so i don't get it ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	( uh ) then i'm always there for a financial bargain so in other words if i can take forty bucks buy forty bucks worth of marijuana i can certainly get more highs than forty bucks worth of ( uh ) any other drug
-	-
client.r+5	so it's just not feasible ( you know ) it's ( not ) not a logical drug to choose if you just want a buzz on ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-1	for that night or whatever alcohol ( and the m* uh ) and the weed ( is suffice you know ) suffices so
-	-
counselor.quo	right so ( what's ) what is sex like without methamphetamines
-	-
client.fn	that's funny i find it would not be similar
client.r+5	( but it but it seems to have it it eh ) because i'm pretty psychoanalytical and it seems to have continued with just the weed ( and the ) and the alcohol and sometimes just the alcohol the same or very close and similar the same experiences so i thought that was good i was [laugh] ( pretty ) pretty happy about that
counselor.res	so even without
-	-
counselor.res	use ( it if ) you feel like you're getting ( some s* ) some ( of ) of the effects that you had before
-	-
client.r-5	yeah ( and and it's not ) and the effects i get without using it after having had used it are certainly much better than before when i'd never had it
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	( s* ) even from fifteen years old on
client.r-5	( you know ) so i thought that was a good thing [laugh]
-	-
counselor.rec	well there are some ( s* ) pretty serious pleasurable side effects on the other hand it's ( r* ) rotting your teeth away ( um ) and it sounds like ( you ) because of that you've decreased your use
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	( um ) is that
counselor.rec	so you've got these sort of ( two ) two things here where you like ( the ) the effects on the other hand you don't like some of the effects that's oral
client.fn	yeah it seems like
counselor.quo	kind of what do you with that
-	-
client.fn	it seems like ( uh ) i try to tell the people that and i do run into them in the construction ( uh ) business and it seems like the ones that got to have it got to do it every day
client.r-2	i try to tell them i go ( you know ) i said ( uh ) you might be able to do marijuana every day i said a drug a mild ( you know ) intensity like that
-	-
client.r+7	i said but ( y* y* you know uh methamph* ) [laugh] meth and coke and practically every other type of drugs just can't be done on a daily basis ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( and i ) and i always give a comparison to them like i go ( you know ) if you're a lottery winner and a multimillionaire you've got the time the money [laugh] to do it every hour ( you know ) i said you'd be dead
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so obviously once you have money you channel into different things ( you know ) you say hey ( you know ) wish i could open a head shop or whatever you wanna do
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+7	but ( you're not ) you're gonna find that being high every day on a daily basis is not gonna be not profitable but i mean profitable just for your health and for your wellbeing and for your senses and so forth
-	-
counselor.res	there are health side effects to ( these ) these drugs yeah
client.r+7	[laugh] yeah
-	-
client.fn	so ( uh you know ) it's like and i don't know why people brush their teeth less when they start doing it than increase ( you know )
client.r+5	and even i've found myself dropping off because of ( the ) when i did it more often a few years ago you find yourself being more kinda lethargic because you've been up for a couple days so you're then tired so then you don't brush so ( you ) you wake up at maybe noon and you brush your teeth once
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+5	( you know ) so ( it ) it does seem like a pattern develops which is not good i mean that's the kind of you wanna break
counselor.rec	yeah you ( stop ) stop taking
-	-
counselor.rec	care of yourself so even your teeth are falling out and
client.r+5	yeah
client.fn	most
-	-
client.fn	of these people have no self_esteem they can't go anywhere during the day they couldn't walk into a police station if they wanted to
client.fn	one girl got robbed at gunpoint by one of her cohorts whom she thought was a great girl [laugh]
client.fn	and i said and i knew it i was being sarcastic on the phone but ( sh* uh ) she sounded it i go so she's in jail i knew she wasn't
client.fn	and she goes hmm no i didn't call the cops
client.fn	i go trisha i said you don't even possess things at your house you just get things for people
client.fn	i said why would you not call the police ( and uh ) well you know i go no i don't
-	-
client.fn	anyway yeah they don't even call the police on i mean ( uh it's a it's ) that's a sad thing
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( and uh ) and they feel like ( you know ) police i'm not gonna call the police well why not [laugh] ( you know ) what's the matter why not
client.fn	( you know ) and then they'll say something like well i hate police ( you know ) and i go oh certain ones and they go no i go well that doesn't make sense
-	-
client.fn	i said what do you mean you hate all the cops i said do you hate them for what doing their job ( you know )
client.fn	[laugh] i said ( you know ) and i've been arrested i've possessed weed [laugh] i've been driving drunk ( you know ) i said why would you hate someone for doing their job
client.fn	i said when the cable t_v guy comes over to your house do you want him to hook you up or do you not want him to hook you up
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	( you know ) and that's just a comparison i give and they're looking at me like what if some of them
-	-
client.fn	( i mean ) i mean that's to me stupid i mean ( uh uh uh ) the guy was hired to do that he's hired to enforce the laws that govern the united_states [laugh]
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah and ( if you're ) sounds like ( uh ) you're well into if you break the law suffer the consequences
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah i don't have any problem with it [laugh]
counselor.fa	right
counselor.res	you you know that
client.fn	i have a problem with people evading their job
counselor.res	you're
client.fn	because as linemen we always look at the guy who wants to shy away oh oh are you gonna get that are you gonna climb that thing ( you know ) we always look at him like
client.fn	( you know ) we all work pretty hard so we're all ( like ) really onto somebody that's not [laugh] doing their job
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) so i mean they're cops it's nothing personal he don't know me
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	( you know ) [laugh] he just stopped me found weed well you gotta [du] do i hate him for that that's his job [laugh] ( you know ) i mean
-	-
counselor.rec	so in some respects it doesn't sound like it's worth the tradeoff ( the s* the ) the pleasure you get versus the consequences
client.fn	the consequences
counselor.quc	( uh d* uh ) is it
-	-
client.fn	yeah and like i say even at disability retirement like i say if you're because i was figuring ( when i ) when i was making the other pay also i was ( uh ) making five_thousand a month
client.fn	well with today's interests that would be like you're living off a million_five_hundred_thousand dollars in the bank ( you know ) with the interests they have now it wouldn't even be five_hundred_thousand
-	-
client.r+5	but anyway you'd kill yourself if you indulge in that and didn't find a focus of ( uh ) an espresso[err] stand or ( s* uh ) doing something ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+5	that's ( you know ) i get ( uh ) i guess people don't get it out here but i get into a rut when i'm not doing anything ( you know ) or getting anywhere or progressing ( you know ) somehow at ( you know ) no matter what age ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( and uh ) and it just seems like they're wasting away ( and ) and they have been
-	-
client.fn	( um ) some of the ones i see that actually try to hustle at work under the table because i've never seen so many nut checks out here everybody gets a nut check
client.fn	i mean back east and in the south they'd go [NVV] you'd better start working if you want money
-	-
client.fn	i mean social_security never or s_s_i or whoever that gives it they'd never give you a check ( for ) because you don't get along well with others and you're twenty_four or something like that
client.fn	everybody has it out here i mean i'm not kidding there's so much of it i can't even believe it ( i i ) i don't even know what happened
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i think they thought they would get liabilities once they granted it to a few they probably thought they'd get sued if they didn't give it to ( the ) everyone
client.fn	where back east they're like well [laugh] [du] you can go [nvv]
-	-
client.fn	get the hell out [laugh]
client.fn	( you know and i ) and i think that's enabled people to be this way and try to ( like ) hustle at work
client.fn	and ( uh ) i've always thought of having i had my contractor's license at one time and i let it expire but ( uh ) i was thinking of getting these guys that do kinda hustle at work but they do a lot of it
client.fn	and i was gonna say well listen ( you know ) i'll buy the old house that fixer_upper and then you do your landscaping thing because you do that you do interiors and all that which i can't do i mean one guy harley he can knock out a kitchen and make everything right
-	-
client.fn	they won't show up because they wanna stay home [laugh] get high with the girl
client.fn	( and ) and i'm like [laugh] i don't get that ( you know ) i mean ( when ) when you have a chance at making real money or making something
-	-
counselor.rec	you have higher ambitions than that
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( they just like ) they don't care [laugh]
client.fn	i'm going goddamn i said i can't understand that if i said that has to be landscaped tomorrow because it's gonna be shown never ( you know ) they just don't show up ( you know ) and it's just ( like )
-	-
counselor.quo	so ( what do you ) what do you think you're gonna do ( if if ) in terms of the meth use
counselor.rec	knowing ( the uh ) the tradeoff between the increase in pleasure and then ( the ) the health consequences
client.fn	well
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.fn	okay ( um ) [laugh] i've got to get some dental coverage which i don't have ( uh )
client.fn	and ( uh ) i need to get ( some ) a lot of dental work done and i don't know how that's gonna be afforded whether i'm doing anything
-	-
client.fn	and the problem is i can't ( uh ) when i get paid weekly as in construction i always have money
client.fn	( you know um ) even though my pay was cut in half i get take_home of six_fifty a week now
client.fn	but getting paid monthly ( whenever i have ) whenever i work with a utility they always pay every two weeks ( you know how everybody ) most big companies pay every two weeks and ( uh ) i never had money
-	-
client.fn	and everybody always said oh you take that one big check and pay your bills and ( uh ) the next one you bank and i go [laugh] do all your bills come at the first of the month i said mine don't so i never had money
client.fn	now i get paid monthly i never have a dime i mean i'll have to have some kind of money ( to ) to keep ( you know ) for i don't know i don't know how i'm gonna do it
-	-
client.fn	i mean ( i i ) i won't be able to spend for ( like ) two months a penny and then maybe be able to ( get ) get going
client.fn	( but ) and it sounds ludicrious i mean it sounds like well six_fifty a week
client.fn	well no i'm telling you i don't you don't have a penny like that because as soon as that check comes the check you were used to getting weekly you've got to take everything out of it and it's gone
-	-
client.fn	i mean now you've got to go a month and then another month no it's not working out like that
-	-
counselor.su	that's hard it sounds like
counselor.gi	but you know what ( so ) but ( s* )
-	-
client.r+5	so that sounds like that's what's gonna terminate my own use ( you know ) [du] you know what i mean i mean i just
counselor.res	so if you're yeah
-	-
counselor.res	just financially
-	-
client.r+5	yeah [laugh] well
-	-
counselor.rec	it's more financial ( than than what ) than you actually wanting to quit
-	-
client.o-5	oh yeah yeah yeah because it's always been controlled
client.r-5	because i've always seen that the primary motivation should be ( you know uh ) and if you do
client.fn	i wasn't trying to tell my nephew something wrong but i was just trying to ( uh ) i believe in education ( you know and i ) and i can't stand ( like ) here i don't know what happened ( uh ) what happened where are these people here that are talking into come my ways
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i didn't drop out of school at eighth and ninth grade we couldn't do that in florida
client.fn	truent officer be right there going i'm sorry ma'am he's got to go to school until sixteen then you can drop out without us and your consent but your consent right now doesn't mean anything
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	how they are able to do it [laugh] i have no idea we had to go to school ( you know ) we couldn't drop out in ninth grade eighth grade and these people have done it all over tacoma and i'm like where was
-	-
client.fn	and that's another thing why i think the west is so far behind ( it's like ) were they afraid to enforce things ( or ) or what was the deal i mean ( i ) i don't know how they could do it
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+5	so yeah financially it's gonna
client.o+5	which is good because then when i do make the money if i do again make the money then it'd be so far away from it ( that )
-	-
client.r+5	( and i'd be uh ) and i've had ( pl* ) the pleasure similar with ( the ) just the drinking and the weed that ( you know ) i would see no validity in getting back into it even though
client.r+5	and i'm ( you know ) fifty_seven [laugh] at this point ( so )
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	which i can't believe but ( uh ) i can't believe i'm three years from sixty but ( um )
-	-
counselor.rec	so that sort of sounds like a plan to stop using ( um ) methamphetamines
client.o+5	yeah
-	-
client.o+5	i mean ( it's ) it's gonna be a forced plan that i don't really have to work at
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+5	[laugh] ( you know ) and then to get back into spending that i'm gonna get used to having the money i'm only making and then when it comes to taking away from that i'm not gonna wanna
-	-
client.fn	so yes and then ( like ) i mean i have a fisherman
client.fn	( uh ) that's another thing people don't go anywhere in tacoma they make excuses of why they don't fly
client.fn	my mom ( uh ) had panic attacks in miami and i was flying back ( like ) six times a year ( you know ) and yeah i don't like it either when ( uh ) all the flights on the west coast take off west and then they bank to head east and i mean during that bank you don't feel any more forward motion [laugh] ( you know ) and you're like
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) and nobody loves flying i'm sure
client.fn	but i mean they make excuses they don't even leave tacoma they don't go to seattle ( they don't ) they don't go anywhere they don't do anything
client.fn	when you're looking at ( you know ) i look at flat florida the whole time and [du]
counselor.quo	( who ) who
-	-
counselor.quo	are these people are these people
counselor.quc	( that are ) that are using drugs or
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	because ( you know ) it's in the construction trade ( and ) and i mean so much
counselor.quc	these are ( co* ) coworkers
-	-
counselor.quc	of yours
-	-
client.fn	the coworkers yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( uh uh ) dennis he ( uh ) i was a foreman with ( uh ) patelco does all of puget_sound_energy's work and ( uh ) they are the first time that puget_sound_energy was the first company that's actually outsourced absolutely everything
client.fn	i mean they laid off all their linemen they have no construction crews they just have ( the ) the single man that comes to your house when you have ( uh ) trouble or something like that
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	and ( uh ) dennis i mean his wife he was a good friend and ( uh ) i went to another section of the company which carries a huge area ( you know ) p_u_d to work
client.fn	and she calls him and she says have you seen dennis and i said ( uh ) not really i said i haven't seen him for ( you know ) quite a while i said why how long has he been ( gon* ) gone [laugh] she goes three months i went what
-	-
client.fn	( so i mean but these people ) well even those people they don't yeah
client.fn	i mean i don't you see the majestic beauty of ( like ) mountain here ( like ) almost every road you're on ( you know )
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	i mean washington can be ( uh ) a magnificent see ( i ) i go to all the creeks and rivers up there and ( s* uh sno* uh ) stillaguamish out in darrington where my ( uh ) friend lived who also worked with p_u_d snohomish
-	-
client.fn	i mean we don't have rivers like that in florida i mean beautiful rivers that you wade right into and ( ca* ) these people don't do anything ( uh )
-	-
counselor.rec	( and do ) and that's because of their drug use
-	-
client.fn	yeah and you know what i found i look at their relationships and the women would be ( s* ) jealous to the point of idiocy i mean ridiculousness
client.fn	and so now i've made the assumption that when they dropped out of school that's the relationship experience that they remember of being your first love and you're really jealous and it's only you two ( you know ) like ninth grade type thing
client.fn	well they didn't mature [laugh] into the senior in high school where they would see that that's ridiculous and they'd be more open
-	-
client.fn	so their relationship was stagnated and arrested in ninth grade
client.fn	so then they're idiotically jealous about stupid and ( i ) i'm just going ( you know ) that's because they did not see ( how to you know ) [laugh] how to mature in relationships and things like that
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	( and and it ) it's amazing to me
counselor.rec	drug use
-	-
counselor.rec	drug use can arrest ( your matu* ) your development
-	-
client.fn	it does [laugh] i was going and i would explain to her i said well your mind of your jealousy is only gonna fulfill what you had seen because you're gonna drive him to that and then your mind will fulfill what your suspicions are just by being that way
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and she says ( you know ) you're right and so he comes out of the albertson's and she goes you were in the bathroom that long what were you doing
client.fn	i go [laugh] i thought you just said you were right
client.fn	( you know ) they don't care i mean ( they ) they can't ( and ) and they don't go anywhere they don't have a hobby
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
client.fn	( you know uh uh ) len this one guy he drops out in ninth grade and he goes ( you know ) i've been smoking meth every day ( you know ) where i'd gotten it from and ( uh ) he says i've been smoking it every day and ( his ) his father's an electrician
client.fn	and ( uh ) he looked at him ( and ) and he's forty_four dropped out in ninth grade i've been smoking meth every day since then
client.fn	i go len ( you know you don't ) you don't fish you don't do ( any* ) you don't have a hobby ( you ) you don't do anything
-	-
client.fn	and his father was looking at him passes him by and says ( you know ) you're not going to get a penny of social_security you've never worked [laugh]
client.fn	( you know ) and i'm like and they still don't i go you've got labor ready right there and i was in_between jobs with the union hall and i walked over ( he ) because he let me stay there for a while ( when uh ) when my car wrecked and all this crap
client.fn	so i had to stay there for about two weeks and then i'm back on my feet ( you know ) two weeks
-	-
client.fn	and this guy can't even walk over the labor [du]
client.fn	( you know ) and he goes well you know that saturday you were going to work that they told you to work and then they said they don't have the work
client.fn	and i go so what i said ( you ) you're depending on washing dishes for your parents and stuff you're forty_four years old
-	-
client.fn	( i said uh uh you know ) i mean i don't understand people like that
client.fn	i mean in florida we were always out boom boom in the morning i don't know and they don't hike they don't camp they don't backpack [laugh] they [laugh] ( like ) just have nothing no life ( you know ) from years
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i don't know ( when i see ) when i think of ten years of drug use oh you're into it a little too heavy no twenty_five years ( is ) that's you i mean that's set your pattern ( that ) that is you ( you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and they've never done anything they never will ( you know ) so i don't know what
-	-
counselor.rec	it sounds like it's pretty destructive ( th* ) there's potential for pretty serious emotional and physical ( uh ) issues
client.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	the only thing i think that
-	-
counselor.rec	over a long period of time
-	-
client.fn	the only thing that's gonna save them is they don't know any better
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	they never have known any better they never will know any better they don't know any better
client.fn	i've never seen a town like tacoma that doesn't tip they don't tip
client.fn	and then i asked people that don't do drugs and i'll say ( you know ) god i can't believe so many of these people don't tip
client.fn	well ( you know ) and they go i know ( you know ) i don't either ( you know ) i don't know jesus christ [laugh] ( you know ) i mean god ( you know ) i don't know
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) my dad was a pretty class act from new_york and he knew the best foods the best wines the best ( you know ) and everything i just don't think that's being ( uh ) transcended from the parents anymore
client.fn	( uh ) they don't i don't know what happened
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.st	well so i don't know that we this i think we can be done with this
counselor.rec	( um i got you know ) i got the impression that ( you're ) you've seen some pretty negative effects of drug use from a number of different drugs and that ( um ) your use your methamphetamine use you've ( well ) well on the one hand ( it ) it does have some positive side effects on the other hand ( it ) it has costs problem with your teeth ( um ) it's expensive you can't really afford it
-	-
counselor.rec	( um ) and you've seen some people have some ( r* ) lifelong problems yeah due to [du]
client.fn	i've never seen them
-	-
client.fn	before unbelievable
-	-
counselor.rec	( and i and i got the ) and i got the impression that you are planning ( uh ) because you can't afford it that's gonna be kind of the way you're not gonna use ( and ) and that ( may ) may have some health benefits for you
client.o+5	yeah
-	-
client.o+5	i hope so
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r-2	because ( uh ) well like i say if i have forty bucks i can get more high with forty dollars worth of marijuana
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-2	and it's healthier for you ( you know ) than the drinking and everything else
client.o+2	i don't mean to advocate it but ( um )
-	-
counselor.rec	so you're kind of reducing ( your ) your risk your health risk by choosing a particular kind of drug
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r-d1	and i can't i wanted to go to drinking
client.r+a1	and i can't
client.r+5	the methamphetamine i think affects my stomach also i really do i don't know how but when you inhale it
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i've never breathed correctly anyway like the athletes are supposed to i've never been able to do that [laugh] and ( uh ) i usually inhale when i'm gonna exhert and you're supposed to exhale so i've always got that screwed up
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.r+5	and ( uh ) after i've smoked it i have felt more discomfort
client.r+5	i'll tell you that's the worst thing you can ever feel that acid coming up and i mean when it gets up here i asked the doctor i go what is that shit i mean that feels like it's real acid and they go yeah it's hydrochloric acid and they're like and they go if you don't address it they said it'll eat through your stomach lining and eat through your aorta one day
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.res	[du]
-	-
counselor.su	ooh
-	-
client.fn	so [laugh] he says you've got to address that i said hmm jesus ( you know ) when you face that stuff
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	that's a serious health ( uh ) risk
-	-
client.r+5	yeah it is
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.st	so ( the ) the last thing that i wanted to show you
counselor.gi	is ( you know you ) you did ( a uh ) a number of different kind of questionnaires with lea
counselor.gi	and ( um ) your answers to these questionnaire kind of you fall into this ( s* ) scale of a level ( of ) of risk that you may be associated that your drug use may be associated with
counselor.gi	and ( when ) when we say risk we mean ( um ) dangers that you may experience in ( um ) mental health emotional medical financial whatever
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) and ( this this the the ) this ( um ) questionnaire is given to a whole bunch of people
counselor.gi	( um ) [clears throat] and so the ( um ) level of risk is scaled from no risk at zero to ten being ( s* ) most severe risk
client.fn	of
counselor.gi	of harm or of danger
-	-
client.fn	in any way arrest or
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah ( in ) ( uh ) across your life across your ( li* like your ) your medical your risk of ( uh ) medical problems your risk of having some kind of physical injury your risk of problems with your emotions or with your ( mental s* ) mental status ( um ) risk of financial problems legal problems
client.nc	[cough]
counselor.gi	( so um ) well i'm [clears throat] kind of asked to ask you
counselor.quc	where do you think you fall on this scale within ( this ) sort of this pyramid here in terms of your risk and your drug use
-	-
client.fn	and that would be past experience and
-	-
counselor.gi	( the ) currently your current drug use and where you might fall in there
-	-
client.o+7	i'm gonna say some risk because of health and stuff like that yeah
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	all right ( the ) the way you scored just from this questionnaire put you at a three which is moderate risk
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	and then as you noticed ( it's it ) yeah it doesn't kinda go up geometrically here
counselor.quo	so ( um ) what do you think of that
counselor.quc	does that make sense to you
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	and ( uh ) moderate risk
client.o+7	yah i would say moderate
-	-
client.o+7	i would almost say moderate yeah
-	-
counselor.res	particularly around health and around finances
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	uh-huh anything else
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) i was explaining to lea how ( you know i came ) we came from a loving family i have two older sisters and ( uh ) i mean we never had two words between us other than love
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and then when there's money involved like my mother who's almost dying she's eighty something and ( uh e* uh ) and kinda like it's to where i can see that the focus is going towards they want that kind of they want at least my inheritance be towards their kids
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	they don't think i deserve it when they're practically millionaires both of them [laugh]
-	-
client.fn	so i mean now i've got to go back east and i don't know if i have to litigate against the one but i wanna make sure those funds are still there
client.fn	i believe the middle sister may have eaten away at my mother's funds
client.fn	she's certainly not has her in a nice retirement home but she's certainly not telling her she has over five_hundred_thousand dollars in c_ds
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and ( she ) my niece said ( uh ) oh your mom and my mom they're both broke ( you know ) and i said [laugh] better not be
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) so now i mean she won't tell me anything so now i have to go back there
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i never thought that kinda crap would happen ( uh you know ) we came from a loving family it's not ( you know )
client.fn	but i heard people telling me that when money's involved and they get older well that's how ( uh ) one of them was that has the seven kids she thinks it's she wants that ( for their kids ) for her kids
counselor.res	so you're having some
-	-
counselor.res	family problems because of the financial stuff too ( um )
-	-
client.fn	yeah ( bec* ) and it all boils down to the finances which they shouldn't worry about i mean they have plenty of money [laugh] ( you know )
client.fn	and ( uh ) me the one that doesn't ( you know ) now i have to go back there and insist on how my mother's health is what's happening ( you know ) and everything and either call the courts into ( uh ) forcing my sister to divulge this stuff or
client.fn	( you know ) because she's keeping it away from me ( and ) and all that stuff so
-	-
counselor.su	hmm thats too bad sorry to hear that
-	-
client.fn	i know it's ( a ) a really crappy way to be when you've always been a regular loving family i mean i don't know

-	-
client.fn	usually i can't relate to what those people say when they hit rock bottom ( i'm like you know )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

-	-
counselor.gi	family_medicine_clinic yeah i'm a social worker in this clinic yeah

client.fn	what's the difference between ( uh uh ) when i was making my appointment i saw adult
-	-
client.fn	adult
counselor.gi	( medicine ) medicine adult medicine is another primary care clinic but it's located in a different part of the hospital here
-	-
client.fn	but what would be the difference i mean no children or something like that
-	-
counselor.gi	well it's different providers it's different doctors yeah there's ( uh ) maybe an orientation on having ( you know ) entire families of all ages
client.fn	oh oh
counselor.gi	so you're treating kids all the way up to ( you know ) seniors
client.fn	oh
counselor.gi	where adult medicine it's primarily people who are of a certain age yeah there's a lot of flexibility and gray area there too
client.fn	oh okay is one better
-	-
client.fn	is one better than the other or not really
-	-
counselor.gi	no i don't
client.fn	i mean these doctors
-	-
client.fn	have really been great here in harborview so
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah i mean you can talk about it with both the clinic or the doctors and but
-	-
client.fn	yeah i was impressed with [du] she was very analytical and ( uh ) really got through the blood draw and wanted to see everything
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and ( you know ) so i've always been happy with the doctors here so
-	-
counselor.su	yeah well good that's what matters i guess
-	-
client.fn	[laugh] yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	all right
client.fn	thanks matt
counselor.af	take care i appreciate it
client.fn	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.nc	[du] that's all we do i'm just gonna ( set it ) set it right there and ( we'll just ) we'll just ignore it
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	sure
counselor.gi	so ( i ) i'm julie i'm a social worker actually in the women's clinic
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	but ( um ) they were having trouble finding somebody up here to ( to uh ) meet with you today because it's crazy
client.fn	okay
client.fn	oh
client.fn	alright
counselor.af	thank you for taking the time ( to ) to do this study
counselor.su	( you know ) i'm sure it wasn't what you were expecting when you walked in the clinic today
client.fn	no
-	-
client.fn	no i think because ( i i ) i instead of trying to talk my doctors into ( um ) giving me ( like ) forty milligrams of painkillers i just get them myself
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r-4	and then every weekend like on a friday night i take those because ( i'm ) i'm in constant pain
-	-
counselor.quo	( uh tell me ) tell me more about that
-	-
client.r-4	well i have ( um ) i'm doing better actually ( i ha* ) i have ( uh ) chronic plantar fasciitis
client.fn	but ( um ) i've got doc_martens and those have helped
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r-4	plus yeah the fascia is a single organ that goes through your whole body so i have pain throughout my whole body
-	-
counselor.res	so it kinda radiates throughout huh
-	-
client.r-4	yeah and then i have clenched jaw and ( i have um ) i have a clenched muscle in my back and i just get to the point where i'm so tense and then if i take some opiates then i can relax
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	so ( it's a good ) it's a good kinda way to get out of the pain and relax
client.r-4	well it's a
-	-
client.r-4	way
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+4	i don't know if it's a good way
client.r-4	but it's a way to get out of the pain
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.res	and ( you say ) you say you take it on the weekends but not during the week
client.fn	yes
client.fn	no
counselor.quo	( what ) and tell me more why weekends and why not other times
client.fn	well
-	-
client.r+d4	because i work during the week and ( and uh i ) i don't wanna be under the influence or
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like it's kind your way to ( make it ) kinda keep it safe
-	-
client.fn	keep it safe yeah
client.fn	and ( it it ) i don't know what i'd do ( if i ) if i didn't ( um ) it probably would become a medical issue that would then be addressed i guess probably with soma or something with a muscle relaxant
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.gi	so ( what what uh ) i'm confused
counselor.quo	( what ) what would become the medical issue
client.r-4	the
-	-
client.r-4	tenseness builds throughout my body
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
counselor.rec	uh-huh but you feel like you've kind of figured out a way to take care of it with kind of side skirting the medical yeah
client.fn	right the system yes
counselor.quo	tell me ( why why ) why have you ( d* ) done that versus talk to your doctor about ( what ) what's available for you ( s* parti* ) particularly
-	-
client.fn	well ( i ha* ) maybe i would ( um ) do that but ( but um there ) doctors aren't inclined ( to to ) as far as i know or in my experience to prescribe you ( um ) painkillers to use like that
-	-
counselor.rec	uh-huh kind of on a ongoing more chronic
-	-
client.fn	well ( like on a ) on a episodic basis like that [du] they'll give you ( p* ) they might give you painkillers for pain but see ( i don't ) i don't want it on a continuous basis
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	right okay
client.fn	( so u* ) so i'm not using it ( in a ) in a medically approved fashion i don't believe
-	-
counselor.quo	okay ( so you're s* ) so tell me more
client.fn	i mean
counselor.res	so you feel like you're using it a little bit to relax
-	-
client.r-4	well it's not to relax ( in the s* ) in the psychological sense in the physical sense
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	right okay
client.fn	( uh ) the thing is i have a history of alcohol drug abuse that shows up on my record ( you know )
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	but ( you you've kicked ) you've kicked that it sounds like
client.fn	i haven't
-	-
client.fn	i [nvv] yeah this is all i do
-	-
counselor.quo	yeah so tell me how
counselor.af	i mean ( that's ) that's pretty cool that you've been able
client.r+4	so it's kind of it's kind of risky behavior
counselor.res	it's kinda ( stan* on that ) on that edge a ( little ) little bit ( you can ) you can see that but
client.r+4	yes a little bit on the edge yeah yeah
counselor.af	well [nvv] you have to ( be ) have been a very strong person to have kicked the alcohol drug stuff
client.fn	well
-	-
client.fn	i don't know about that i mean ( i had to go ) i had to go in for six months to the clinic and get antabuse every day ( under ) under supervision to stop drinking [laugh] so i don't know how strong i am
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	right
client.r+d1	but i don't want to go back to the alcohol
client.r+d4	and i don't want to become physically or even psychologically addicted to the opiates
-	-
counselor.res	right so ( doing your ) your thought is doing it on the weekend and not
client.o-4	i do it just
-	-
client.o-4	i do it generally just once a week
counselor.res	once
-	-
counselor.rec	once a week it's not gonna get you addicted but it provides some relief for your
client.o-4	no
-	-
client.r-4	oh yes oh yes
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	but during the week ( it's just k* your ) your pain and
-	-
client.fn	have to live with it
-	-
counselor.rec	you just you have to sort of charge through it yeah because you've got a job and
client.fn	sure
client.fn	right
counselor.quo	( what kinda ) what kinda work do you do
-	-
client.fn	( well i ) well the thing is i work ( at at at ) at a ( uh ) mental health clinic i work at [du] sound_mental_health i'm a benefits planner actually in the [du] department
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	okay okay ( um )
client.fn	so you see i deal with people with alcohol drug issues
-	-
counselor.rec	kinda all the time ( you ) you see it from ( all ) all the angles
client.fn	yes
client.fn	yeah i do
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah i do
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	plus i work at the alcohol drug helpline this is the ultimate irony ( um ) referring people ( for ) for drug use drug and alcohol use to where they can get treatment
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so ( it ) it is interesting because i mean ( you ) you said a couple things when you said sort of the ultimate irony and also kind of realizing you're on that little ( type ) tight rope
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	yes
-	-
client.fn	( the th* ) the thing and i studied to become ( a ) a chemical dependency counselor and ( i ) i worked as one for a while
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but the thing is ( if you ) if you use whatever it is and ( it's it doesn't it you're not u* [nvv] ) it's not interfering with your life all the people who drink alcohol are not alcoholics likewise all the people who use other drugs aren't necessarily drug addicts
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.af	right that's a good point
client.fn	so
counselor.rec	so for you ( you're ki* you look at that ) you kind of weigh it that way ( is it how you know what's it ) how is it helping is it interfering with my life
-	-
client.r-4	but it gives me such relief ( i can't rej* ) i can't relax my jaw without it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	wow so throughout the week your jaw is just getting ( te* ) more and more tense
client.fn	well it's
-	-
client.r-4	( it's it's rel* ) being able to relax it once a week makes a big difference
-	-
counselor.res	uh-huh just ( takes ) takes some of that edge off
-	-
client.r-4	it makes it all manageable where otherwise ( it it ) eventually ( be* ) it can become unmanageable
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.gi	( uh )
client.r-4	[du] i can't i lose my mobility
-	-
counselor.gi	so it seems like ( i ) i can see where the benefits are
counselor.rec	( you know ) you definitely are getting ( you're ) first of all ( you're ) it seems like you're figuring out a way to kinda ( manage it ) manage the drug use in terms of kinda safety ( you know ) you know ( you have to ) you have a job to do it's not inter*
client.fn	sure
client.o-4	right ( i don't i don't i don't ) i don't drive impaired
-	-
counselor.rec	right it's not interfering with your job because you're not doing it during the week it gives you a space to kind of relax your whole body ( get ) get kinda calm on the weekend
client.fn	right
client.r-4	right
-	-
client.r-4	well it's the relaxation it's the tense muscles
-	-
counselor.res	yeah it kind of takes that edge off
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	you're not doing it while you're driving
client.fn	no
counselor.res	you're figuring out a good safe place to do it
client.fn	right
counselor.rec	so all that ( it feels ) what i'm hearing from you feels like you kinda have figured out a lot of stuff but i also heard you say sort of knowing that you've had sort of a history of drug and alcohol stuff you also realize you're on that tightrope
client.fn	right
client.fn	sure
client.r+4	right
-	-
counselor.quo	( what what what do what do you s* ) what would it look like for you to drop off the tightrope in terms of what you're doing
client.fn	start
-	-
client.fn	using it during the week
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.res	so maybe you
client.fn	or even through the weekend that's how it would start through the weekend and then it would escalate i'd use it during the week
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	i'd have to have a source for it though
-	-
counselor.quo	mm-hmm what's your sour*
counselor.gi	i mean ( i i ) i don't
client.fn	for one thing
-	-
client.fn	my ( uh ) girlfriend
-	-
counselor.res	okay uh-huh you'd have to have a better source
client.fn	she
-	-
client.fn	she's one of those people ( who ) who just gets a prescription for more pain reliever than she ever uses
counselor.res	than she needs
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.res	( so she ) so the
client.fn	( she she ) she takes half of one or a quarter of one
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.res	she doesn't really need very much
-	-
client.fn	no and then only ( you know ) not that much ( her her ) her use doesn't escalate
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.gi	( i um ) i can kinda speculate ( what ) how you might answer this but i'm gonna ask you
counselor.quo	again why haven't you asked your doctor if there's some kind of
-	-
client.fn	well i've talked to them about it my doctors know that i do it they have a
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.res	oh ( they ) they do
-	-
counselor.res	they do know that you
client.fn	oh yeah
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	they haven't offered to write me a prescription for it
-	-
counselor.rec	( so you're so you're ) it sounds like you're really up front with your doctors about yeah and they know that you're ( getting ) getting it and that it's helping
client.fn	sure
client.fn	yes
counselor.quc	and are they saying this might not be useful to you or how
-	-
client.fn	they don't say anything
-	-
counselor.res	they don't give you feedback at all huh
-	-
client.fn	not really
-	-
counselor.gi	huh interesting i mean ( i'm no ) i'm not a doctor so but it is interesting
client.fn	there was not very
-	-
client.fn	much discussion about it at all
counselor.gi	interesting
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	it's like ( i don't ) i don't ask for the prescription and they don't offer it and ( they don't ) they don't really talk about it
-	-
counselor.gi	huh ( we* why what would it ) i mean ( i'm ) i would be kind of curious to ( a* ) ask them a little bit more what they think
-	-
client.fn	well one thing is ( it's a* it's ) generally it's always a new doctor
counselor.fa	oh okay
client.fn	so i don't really have a relationship with any of them and ( they don't ) they're not seeing me for very long
counselor.fa	right right
-	-
counselor.rec	right so it's not like you've built up this kinda comfortable rapport and
client.fn	no
counselor.fa	right right
-	-
client.fn	because ( they're alr* ) they're always rotating through
-	-
counselor.res	right but it sounds like you're very open with them about how you're dealing with
client.fn	oh i'll tell them yeah
-	-
client.fn	i'll tell them
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	because in terms of treating the underlying problem in the past we've treated that with ( um uh non-pres* ) non-prescription ( uh ) pain relievers and with other things in terms of ( the ) the fasciitis et cetera
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	right so kind of
-	-
client.fn	now ( that's been ) in the past that's been treated currently ( there's no ) i have no treatment for that
-	-
counselor.res	uh-huh so now you're ( dre* ) treating it with prescription pain relievers but
-	-
client.fn	yeah well i was all along
-	-
counselor.rec	uh-huh even while you were doing the other uh-huh and this seems like it's helped you the most
client.fn	yes
-	-
client.fn	( um ) generally yes ( there there um ) if i get an injury then ( i need a uh ) i need ( a uh like a m* ) like a muscle relaxant
client.fn	and ( there's one ) there's one med in particular i'm trying to even remember i haven't taken it for years that works for me
-	-
counselor.res	mm-hmm so in addition to ( what ) what else you're given
client.fn	yes
-	-
client.fn	( it's it's a uh ) it's an old-fashioned aspirin substitute and i'm trying to remember what it is
client.fn	( but i ) but something like that i can use at fairly high doses to deal with the inflammation
-	-
counselor.quc	uh-huh like ibuprofen kind of thing or
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	something like that
-	-
counselor.res	uh-huh but ( high ) high dose
-	-
client.fn	higher doses yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	( um how you know ) kinda on a scale of zero to ten ( how um ) how much do you think or how worried are you about the level of drug use that you have now
-	-
client.o-4	i'm not
-	-
counselor.res	doesn't sound like it yeah
counselor.quc	so zero
-	-
client.o+4	well a little above zero
-	-
counselor.quo	mm-hmm ( what ) and what
client.fn	one to ten
counselor.gi	yeah one to ten
client.fn	maybe a
-	-
client.fn	maybe a two
-	-
counselor.quo	okay why a two versus a one
-	-
client.r+4	well because ( it's it's ) it's risky behavior for me to be taking opiates
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm because of your history
-	-
client.r+4	because of my history
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.o+4	if i were to get access to a larger supply then ( it would be ) i'd have to make the choice not ( to ) to access that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	it doesn't cost me anything either you see ( there's no there's no ) i don't have to pay for it
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.res	because your girlfriend has it
-	-
client.fn	she just has it
-	-
counselor.gi	and ( um i ) i mean i can speculate if you've got your own supply it might be a larger supply and maybe more accessible to you
-	-
client.o+4	well that's possible i wouldn't want that
-	-
counselor.quc	mm-hmm so is it possible that doing what you're doing now ( is ) feels safer to you
-	-
client.o+4	well i don't know if it's safer
client.fn	but i wouldn't agree to
-	-
counselor.rec	more than a small dose small
client.fn	well
-	-
client.fn	more than the dosage that i have that i currently do
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.rec	right so it sounds like you've got a pretty good handle on what works for you but it's interesting ( that that you can't that you ) that there's some kind of barrier ( that make ) that keeps you from making it kind of legitimate your own prescription
-	-
client.fn	yeah i don't think the doctors ( pres* ) prescribe it that
client.fn	they could i'll talk to them about it
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah ( i w* i wouldn't ) i wouldn't put it
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	be possible
counselor.res	yeah i mean obviously ( nobody's had ) nobody's kind of had a ( talk to ) talk with you and you've been very open about what you've been doing
counselor.gi	and i mean i think the benefit to having it prescribed to you and then being able to monitor
client.fn	oh it'd be a
-	-
client.fn	big benefit
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+4	because it's dangerous to transport it
-	-
counselor.rec	ahh right so sort of just the legality of it would be a big benefit yeah
client.fn	yes
-	-
client.fn	that would be a huge benefit
-	-
counselor.gi	well and i think the other benefit and again i'm not a doctor but i speculate that one benefit would be they could monitor how is this particular drug working for you and ( you know ) are there potential ( you know ) side effects or whatever
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	well sure
client.fn	sure
counselor.gi	yeah and it kind of opens the door for you to be
counselor.af	i mean ( you ) you seem like a very open person
client.fn	sure
counselor.gi	but it opens the door to have even more of that communication
client.fn	sure
-	-
client.fn	well i'll talk to them about it
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah ( d* ) does it sound
-	-
client.fn	it sounds reasonable
-	-
counselor.res	yeah ( um ) i mean i don't want to put words in your mouth but it sounds like you are already talking with them about it
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah oh they know
counselor.res	it's just kinda
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah have you thought about taking that step to ( um )
-	-
client.fn	( i ) well ( i ) i've talked to them i think i have asked for it in the past but ( they've ) they said no
-	-
counselor.quo	uh-huh did they tell you why
-	-
client.fn	( i ) they just don't use it that way they don't use it ( as a ) as a way to relax your muscles when you have fasciitis
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quc	uh-huh okay and is it
client.fn	and it's not
-	-
client.fn	in their framework of how to deal with the problem
-	-
counselor.quc	and then what they have used in the past has have you tried that and it hasn't worked for you
-	-
client.fn	well they took me off those for concern about my kidneys and my liver
-	-
counselor.fa	okay okay
-	-
client.fn	and they didn't do the same thing really anyway they wouldn't relax me
-	-
counselor.res	uh-huh in the same way
-	-
client.fn	they would just get ( the ) rid of the pain
-	-
counselor.quc	right so any concerns about your kidneys and liver ( with the ) with the
-	-
client.o-4	not at these dosages
-	-
counselor.res	uh-huh it's small enough
client.o-4	not at
-	-
client.o-4	ten milligrams at a time no
-	-
counselor.rec	sounds like you've done your kind of background work too
client.o-4	i'm not
-	-
client.o-4	i'm not taking that much
-	-
counselor.quc	right right ( how ) how much are you taking
-	-
client.fn	ten milligrams at a time
-	-
counselor.quc	uh-huh ( like ) vicodin or
-	-
client.fn	well ( if i get i get uh ) i get oxycodeine and i get ( uh ) percocet
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm so it sounds like i mean ( one of ) one of the benefits ( to making it ) to talking about your doctor and if the doctor agrees yeah let's try ( this ) this plan would be ( to not ) the legality ( of you ) ( for ) for you and for your girlfriend
client.fn	mm
client.r+4	the legality is a big issue
-	-
client.fn	well she really isn't that much exposure ( but ) but yeah
counselor.fa	but yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	i mean ( she ) she risks something by ( you know by by ) offering her own drugs to you
client.o+4	something
client.o+4	well something
counselor.rec	yeah yeah i mean ( you know ) you know the system well given ( you ) that you work within that system and it sounds like ( well ) well versed yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	( um i'd like to ) i wanted to give you ( you ) i know you filled out a bunch of these forms out there
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	( um ) and it sounds like ( you really are ) at this point that your only ( dru* ) drug is doing this on the weekend no other alcohol or
client.fn	correct
client.fn	no
counselor.af	yeah you were able to get beyond that
-	-
client.r+a1	no i can't drink
client.r+1	it's poison to me
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah how long ago ( did ) did you stop
-	-
client.fn	fifteen years ago
-	-
counselor.res	wow so it's been a while
client.fn	i'm
-	-
client.fn	the other thing is i'm bipolar
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.quc	so are
client.fn	so i'm treated for that
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so you've got ( that ) those meds too to sort of
-	-
client.fn	oh i have a lot of meds
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah ( i ) i mean ( i i you know ) just hearing that too ( it's ) i think it's useful for a doctor to be able to see okay ( how ) what's the interaction between these things
client.nc	[nvv]
-	-
client.fn	well they know that i'm taking them
-	-
counselor.adw	right maybe having more of a conversation about it to just say hey ( you know ) can we what do you think of ( per* ) prescribing this it seems like it's helping me
client.fn	okay
client.fn	sure
-	-
client.fn	that would be fine
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah but also ( y* ) your i mean it sounds like you also know yourself well enough to know don't give me a big huge bottle of ( h* ) high dose
client.o+4	oh no
-	-
client.r+n4	no i don't need that
-	-
counselor.res	yeah you can do it ( little ) little bit at a time and you're fine
client.fn	right
counselor.quo	yeah tell me what other fears you have about it
-	-
client.o+4	well just ( that i ) that it would escalate i'd get access to more opiates and it would escalate
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r+4	i mean i could do it every day but ( it it it would ) it would affect me o* opiates and bipolar don't mix well together
-	-
counselor.quo	right what keeps you from doing it every day
-	-
client.r+d4	i don't wanna be addicted i don't want to go down that road
-	-
counselor.quc	uh-huh ( does ) does your girlfriend provide some kind of support or [du]
client.fn	[laugh] yeah she's
-	-
client.fn	( she's ) she's appalled at how much i'll ( i'll u* that that that i use it you know she uses it ) she cuts it in half she takes it cut in half and i take a whole one
client.fn	occasionally i'll take more than that
-	-
counselor.res	uh-huh so ( she she ) she's surprised at how much you could take compared to her
client.fn	oh yeah
-	-
client.fn	oh yeah i can take ten times what she can take
-	-
counselor.quc	wow and have you done that at times
-	-
client.fn	occasionally
-	-
counselor.quc	how often does that happen
client.fn	not
-	-
client.fn	very often
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah so what is ten times what she can take
-	-
client.fn	( f* say f* ) say forty milligrams at a time
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.res	( so ) so
counselor.res	generally
client.fn	that will just about knock me out
-	-
counselor.quc	uh-huh how often do you think ( that ) that you do that
-	-
client.fn	maybe once a year
-	-
counselor.quo	( what ) what gets you to that point
-	-
client.r-4	( that the p* that that the that the ) that the pain ( is ) is so intense [du] to knock it out and ( to ) to actually relax my jaw
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-4	( it's ) it's my jaw ( you know ) if you can relax your jaw ( you c* ) you can relax the rest of your body but if you can't relax your jaw you can't relax the rest of your body
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.res	it's all tense
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.r-4	said this i don't know if it's true but i tell you [nvv] get my jaw to relax ( i* if ) if i get to the point where i'm really actually clenching it ( it takes a lot of uh ) it takes forty milligrams for me to be able to unclench it
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	( and ) and then i physically manipulate it in order to be able to unclench it on top of it
-	-
counselor.quo	what do you think gets your j*
counselor.quc	d* do you find yourself getting more and more that way as you
-	-
client.fn	if i'm under stress or tension
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	or if i'm injured my back is injured
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	so all this kinda connected pain basically
client.r-4	c* yes
counselor.rec	mm-hmm it's not that like what i can imagine another would be that ( you know ) one week ( you know ) ten milligrams isn't working so the next week you do two ( it's not ) it's not ( that ) that kind of thing it's more that it's more what's happening and [du] around your
client.fn	no
client.fn	it's not that kind of thing
client.fn	right
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	but it
-	-
client.r-4	( but ) but it's important that i be able to unclench my jaw that is important
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.gi	i would
client.r-4	that's a very important aspect of my life
-	-
counselor.adw	( i you know ) it sounds like it's worth having that conversation with your doctor
client.fn	yeah
counselor.res	and ( you know ) you've been open with them about what you've tried and you know kind of what works
counselor.adw	ask them what the pros and cons of it is
-	-
client.fn	well the thing is ( they would they they ) they would more likely put me onto a path that would be more dangerous like daily soma use
-	-
counselor.adw	tell them you don't want that
client.fn	yeah
counselor.ec	you have a choice
-	-
client.fn	[laugh] i understand
-	-
counselor.ec	yeah i mean ( you really ) you have kind of taken things ( under your you know ) in your control and you've got a pretty good sense of who you are and what your body will take ( what your what your um you know ) kind of what your tolerance for drugs and alcohol are
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.o+1	right which is none for alcohol
-	-
counselor.af	yeah and you've got a good sense of that
client.fn	[du] yeah
counselor.gi	i think it could be a dialogue
client.fn	okay
counselor.quo	yeah ( what do ) what do you think
-	-
client.fn	oh sure i'll talk to them about it and see what they say
-	-
counselor.quc	yeah ( how um ) how likely do you think it will be that you talk to them
-	-
client.fn	hundred percent likely
counselor.fa	oh
-	-
counselor.fa	really
-	-
client.fn	[laugh] oh yes
counselor.af	oh
-	-
counselor.af	wonderful [laugh] wonderful
client.nc	[laugh]
counselor.st	( um you know i i ) i'm gonna check back with you in about a week just to kind of check in see
client.fn	oh okay well
-	-
client.fn	i won't see them for months
-	-
counselor.rec	oh because it's not somebody you see today
-	-
client.fn	no i won't see another doctor for months for three or four months at least
counselor.fa	oh okay
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	hmm
client.fn	every three four months ( you know you go to the f* i see ) i see a doctor doctor says ( i wanna see you know ) i want someone else to see you in three months typically
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	and then you go to the front desk and they say we're not booking
client.fn	so then they say call back in a month and then you call in and then they give you an appointment so it can be three four five months whatever
counselor.res	oh for
counselor.res	and you've already
-	-
counselor.res	been seen today
-	-
client.fn	well ( i mean you know ) and then they're always sort of curious why i guess they'll continue to see me they've been trying to control my cholesterol basically and my high blood pressure
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	and so ( they ) they have me come in and then they run tests and they give me more meds for this this has gone on for years until finally now it's pretty much under control
-	-
counselor.res	( the ) the cholesterol is
-	-
client.fn	yes and the high blood pressure
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	so i don't know that ( they'll keep ) this pattern will continue or not where i come in every three four months to see a doctor
-	-
counselor.res	and it sounds like mostly they're monitoring ( your ) your cholesterol
client.fn	right
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	so i don't know ( when what ) what will happen
-	-
counselor.quc	who do you see ( for for the ) for the jaw tension
client.fn	well like i said
-	-
client.fn	( i don't i don't ) in adult medicine you don't
-	-
counselor.res	see any ( thing ) body for one specific thing or kinda the whole person
client.fn	no ( you ) you
-	-
client.fn	just have ( the ) the people rotate through constantly and sometimes you get really good doctors and sometimes see i don't know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.res	right right so
counselor.res	[laugh] kind of a crap shoot huh
client.fn	[laugh] so well once once in a while i've had a couple ( that i just you know that ) that just weren't on top of it that much
-	-
counselor.res	yeah you're seeing a lot of ( r* ) residents coming through
client.nc	[laugh]
-	-
client.fn	( you see a r* ) you see a big variety
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	i mean overall i'm very happy with the care i get
counselor.fa	right right
client.fn	but ( you s* ) you see different people ( you know )
-	-
counselor.af	sounds like you've got a good attitude about that too [du]
client.fn	it's just
-	-
client.fn	( you just ) you take what you get
counselor.fa	right right
client.fn	but ( they ) they follow through basically with the same thing
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( it's it's ) once in a while something new comes up and then they start following on that tracking on that
-	-
counselor.res	so the next time you see somebody will probably be three or four months down the road
client.fn	correct
counselor.res	( you th* ) ( you think ) you think at that point ( you can ) you'll ( uh )
-	-
client.fn	remember this conversation oh yes
counselor.gi	yeah yeah
-	-
counselor.res	you think so okay
client.fn	sure i will
counselor.af	good good i mean ( it it's ) it sounds like you do have a pretty good handle on what you're doing you've got good insight
client.fn	yes
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.res	but given that you have the bipolar disorder and that you've got medications ( on tha* you know ) taking care of that you've got the high cholesterol ( that you're ) they're balancing all that
counselor.adw	it's kinda good to
client.fn	well
-	-
client.o+4	one thing is what if i break up with my girlfriend or ( if sh* if she ) if she gets ( uh ) kicked off ( her ) her pain meds then i won't have my source
counselor.fa	ex*
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.res	what happens
-	-
counselor.af	exactly that's a very good point that's a very good point
client.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	yes
counselor.gi	and ( you know )
client.r+4	so it's
-	-
client.r+4	kinda tenuous
-	-
counselor.rec	and you don't want your relationship ( to be her ) with her to be just about keeping you ( in the ) in the drugs
client.fn	exactly
-	-
client.r+4	exactly ( it's it it's it's enmeshment that's ) it's unhealthy enmeshment and it's ( uh ) a codependency and it's a lot of issues yes
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	exactly
-	-
counselor.res	yeah so it kinda ( would ) could clean that up a little bit too
counselor.adw	( i mean ) another option would be to think about let's get back in and see somebody sooner and you could
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	oh
-	-
client.fn	i can wait
counselor.res	you can wait
client.fn	there's no there's no practical way to see s* if i went to the front desk out here and said i need to see somebody sooner they would look at me like [laugh] what are you talking about [laugh]
counselor.res	are you crazy [laugh]
client.fn	yeah ( they they ) they wouldn't respond to that at all
-	-
counselor.rec	you know the system well
client.fn	at all
-	-
client.fn	( you know ) the thing with adult medicine ( if ) if you really need to be seen you go to the e_r and go to urgent medicine they'll tell you this at this desk
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but ( you go ) you go to urgent medicine you also can come here and try to get in and then you wait around for a while and talk to them and they say well you better go down to urgent because we're not gonna be able to get you in
counselor.nc	[du]
-	-
client.fn	so you go from here yeah ( on a on a uh getting ) try to get on a waiting list and get squeezed in here
counselor.res	down there
client.fn	and then ( as as look at the s* ) if they look at the schedule they say well we're not gonna be able to see you probably go down to urgent go down to the e_r
-	-
counselor.gi	well i guess you've got that option if for some reason things do flare up too ( your you know get to that p* you know ) between now and three or four months from now
client.fn	well yeah
-	-
client.fn	( yeah i ) well i don't think it'll flare up
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	hopefully it won't
-	-
counselor.af	seems like you're pretty stable
-	-
client.fn	yeah it's been like this for a long time
-	-
counselor.quo	good and how about the bipolar stuff
counselor.quc	is that pretty stable too
-	-
client.fn	that's so stable i sometimes worry they're gonna kick me off medicare
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	( i ) actually i earn enough money i don't get a check anymore
-	-
counselor.res	oh but you're [du]
client.fn	i've earned
-	-
client.fn	myself out of benefits
client.fn	but i rely upon them for my medical
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	see they won't kick me off the medical because without the medical i'd go nuts
-	-
counselor.rec	so then it would be back in the same cycle again
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	so yeah but the thing is to get from the medicare to the medicaid
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	and currently they're confused they're not charging me a premium for medicaid
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	i've talked to them on the phone i called them up and ( and uh ) so i'm gonna have to start paying a premium for medicaid again you buy in
counselor.res	for medicare you
client.fn	no medicaid
-	-
counselor.res	oh to have that supplement
client.fn	you if you
-	-
client.fn	if you're on medicare and you work you can then buy into medicaid ( with a s* ) with a modest premium
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	yeah less than ten percent of your income ( seven and a half ) no more than seven and a half percent of your gross income as a premium
counselor.fa	uh-huh
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	and ( you buy ) you go from medicare you do a buy in to medicaid
-	-
counselor.res	uh-huh and you get the
client.fn	that's heal*
-	-
client.fn	that's healthcare with workers with disabilities
counselor.af	oh cool
client.fn	that's a great deal
-	-
counselor.af	that is a good deal
client.fn	yes
counselor.res	it really gives you full kind of safety net
client.fn	then you don't p*
-	-
client.fn	then you don't pay anything for your prescriptions ( it pays ) it pays part part_a is normally automatic but part_b ( an* ) and part_d
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	or actually ( you're you're ) you have medicaid so you don't have to worry about any of that
counselor.fa	right
counselor.af	right cool
client.fn	now that's currently what i have
counselor.af	good
client.fn	( i th* ) i'm not supposed to have it
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	i send them in my pay stubs and they get confused and they say well you ( um ) make so little money that you qualify for medicaid directly
counselor.fa	oh
client.fn	but that's not you can do that but i make more money than the threshold only they're confused
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	i call them up try to straighten them out
counselor.nc	[laugh]
-	-
counselor.rec	( and you get ) and you get nowhere
client.fn	i get nowhere
counselor.su	oh well
-	-
client.fn	but ( i ) i need to straighten them out
-	-
counselor.rec	because you don't want to have an overpayment or whatever
client.fn	or s*
-	-
client.fn	whatever yeah you want to have ( your ) your coverage ( you know ) all kosher and together
counselor.rec	yeah or underpayment
counselor.fa	right exactly
client.fn	you don't want problems
-	-
counselor.st	exactly ( i wanted to ) before we left i wanted to make sure you got
counselor.gi	( one of the ) one of the ( um ) tests that you did was called the dast it's called a ( dr* uh ) what does it stand for drug_alcohol_screening_test
client.fn	mm
counselor.gi	and ( it's on a ) it gives you ( uh ) a rating between zero and ten in terms of kind of where your risk level is
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	and ( that's ) that's kinda where you'd landed ( um ) ( are you s* ) are you surprised at that
client.fn	okay
counselor.quc	or does that seem appropriate
client.o+4	no i have
-	-
client.o+4	i have some risk
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+4	so ( i jus* w* ) i'd have to have some
-	-
counselor.rec	right and you kinda talked about you have a pretty good sense of what that risk is ( one ) one the legality you're ( you know ) in the kind of relationship that you have with your girlfriend and ( you know ) keeping that open
client.fn	right
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	and ( you know i i don't you know i ) i know i mentioned ( you know ) other drug interactions
counselor.quo	i don't know how how do you feel about that
-	-
client.o-4	not too worried about it
-	-
counselor.res	mm-hmm ( the more ) it seems like more it's about ( the drug drug legali* ) the legality
-	-
client.r+4	the legality is a big issue yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	especially with ( your ) your job
-	-
client.r+4	there's a risk i'm using opiates and i have a history of alcohol drug use
client.o+4	any time anybody any time i'm using opiates there's a risk involved
-	-
counselor.fa	right exactly
client.r+4	it can escalate
counselor.adw	yeah well you keep that in mind
counselor.adw	because i think ( that that ) that's a good thing to ( you know it it ) when that's at the forefront of your mind ( it's a ) it's a good little stopping point too for you okay
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.af	alright well it was really great to meet you
counselor.nc	i'm gonna turn this off now
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-

client.nc	[laugh]
counselor.st	and ( um you know ) basically we're going to have a conversation
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	and ( you know ) you filled out some materials upfront
-	-
client.fn	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.quo	and ( um ) do you have an idea of what that was about
-	-
client.fn	sure ( um ) basically all drug ( drug ) related
-	-
counselor.fa	okay okay so ( um )
-	-
client.fn	and ( and sexual ) some sexual stuff
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i
-	-
client.fn	couldn't really help them there because i'm abstinent [laughs]
-	-
counselor.gi	okay okay so ( um ) what you did is that you filled out what is ( you know ) a measure called the d_a_s_t
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	and it's the ( uh ) drug_abuse_screening_test
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	and there was it was scored ( um ) from it was zero or really one to ten
client.fn	okay
counselor.gi	( uh ) ten being severe risk zero being ( you know ) no risk
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.quc	where do you think you were on that scale
-	-

-	-
client.o+7	( i ) if there's treatment available i'd like to know it okay

counselor.gi	[du] you know why
-	-
client.fn	[du]
-	-
counselor.gi	alright so again my name is lauren i'm a social worker in clinic
counselor.gi	and ( um ) wanted to come in and speak with you today if you don't mind about ( your ) your drug use
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	( um ) i'm sure naomi prepped you a little bit for that right
client.fn	right exactly
counselor.quo	yeah yeah so what brings you in to clinic in general
-	-
client.fn	well ( um ) my ( uh ) girlfriend told me about it
client.fn	and she said i should try it and see what's going on being that i do these drugs
client.fn	so i told her i would so that's what brought me here
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
counselor.res	so you came in specifically for this study then
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	alright
-	-
client.fn	she's ( you know ) persistent so [du]
client.fn	i had an appointment yesterday and she told me about the social worker so i just talked to her yesterday
counselor.fa	sure
client.fn	she told me to come in today
-	-
counselor.res	alright and here you are
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	okay so how would you feel ( you know ) kind of starting off and filling me in ( on ) on substances that you use and
-	-
client.fn	oh heroin and ( i ) i use about maybe five times a month
client.fn	and what holds me over is ( my medi* ) my ( uh ) pain pills that i get from my primary doctor
client.o-4	so it's not like i have to have it every day
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like the pain medication is kind of keeping you from using every day maybe so if you didn't have that pain medication
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	right
client.fn	right
client.fn	right right it is
client.fn	sorry
-	-
client.o-4	i'd be done i'd be done
counselor.res	you'd be
client.o-4	i mean i'd be what i'm saying is i'd be out there hustling trying to make sure i'd be able to use every day
counselor.fa	sure
client.fn	so i use my medication like i'm supposed to so that way i have enough through the month
-	-
counselor.rec	okay but the medication doesn't sound like enough to keep you from using the heroin either
-	-
client.r-4	the heroin thing is a completely different ( you know ) kind of high
client.fn	so when i don't i don't have to take my pills if i'm on heroin
client.fn	so so then when i feel kinda edgy or something like that i just ( you know ) take a little bit more than i have to so i don't have to ( go ) go for the heroin
counselor.res	take [du]
-	-
client.fn	so it's just
counselor.res	so you take a little more medication
-	-
client.fn	yeah right
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( it ) it pretty much ( um ) levels out ( to some ) from the time i didn't use it when i did the heroin
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	so you understand what i'm saying
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.fn	okay
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	but it sounds like you're still using the heroin because it is that different high
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r-4	yeah it is it is something [du] yeah it is
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o-4	so it's just heroin and my medication
client.o+4	i mean that's a lot
client.o-4	but that's all it is
-	-
counselor.quc	and how long have you been balancing the two
-	-
client.fn	( uh ) say because i started back it's been a couple years
client.fn	i mean i hadn't been using for it's been about five years i was off
client.fn	( you know ) so i don't know i was around it
client.fn	i knew people who you know sold it so that's probably what really did it

client.o-4	( you know so ) either way with it i'm comfortable
client.o-4	i don't try to o_d or anything
client.fn	and ( i ) i know people don't have ( that ) that good strength like that

counselor.res	yeah yeah it sounds like you're safe
-	-
client.o+4	it's still a habit
client.o-4	but i mean ( you know )
-	-
counselor.rec	but it sounds like you're calculated that you ( you know ) you're trying not to o_d you're aware that you have ( these ) these other substances to kind of balance things out ( and ) and you go about it in the safest way you possibly can it sounds like
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah

client.fn	so like i said [du] i just started right back
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

client.fn	yeah yeah
-	-
client.fn	plus her ( as my ) my feelings and [du] my girlfriend we talked about this
client.fn	so this has all been building up ( you know ) because sometimes you gotta talk ( you know ) to somebody about this stuff that's why i'm here

counselor.quc	okay and are there any differences between ( now ) your use now and your use ( before )
counselor.res	before you ( you know ) were incarcerated and before you said ( i'm ) i'm just gonna kick the habit

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	because i ( you know ) was incarcerated had a warrant [du] in washington so [du]

counselor.af	that's excellent
counselor.quo	so where do you see yourself down the road
counselor.rec	( you know ) we've talked a little bit about the past ( and ) and where you are now and how you have a sense of control over your use and now it sounds like you're not looking to go back and repeat what happened before yeah
client.r+a4	no i can't
-	-
client.r+4	because there's people around me that ain't going for it one thing
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	sure
client.r+4	so ( um ) actually ( uh uh ) she wants to get married i wanna get married so we're gonna try that so looking forward to that
client.r-a4	and ( um ) ( i don't know ) i can't just sit up here and lie and say i'm ready to quit
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.c-4	because i'm not
counselor.fa	sure
-	-
client.o-4	so ( i ) i just think i'm using it moderately [err]
client.r+4	sometimes she says that i'm just getting out of hand
client.r+4	so ( uh ) i've been listening to her more then
client.fn	that's another reason why i'm here too
client.o-4	so i don't know i don't know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	it sounds like you have a lot of support you have a lot of support you have these goals in mind ( you know ) you know where the drug can take you if you let it take you there and that's not a place you're willing to go
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	oh yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	right
-	-
client.r+4	hmm not again no
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+4	i would lose everything i have actually
client.r+4	it's not much but i appreciate what i have
client.r+4	so i just wanna live
-	-
counselor.rec	sure those are all big motivators to keep you either using it the way you're using now right
client.fn	uh-huh
counselor.adw	or possibly looking at cutting back in the future
counselor.quc	have you ever considered that
counselor.adw	not necessarily quitting altogether because
-	-
client.o-4	( you know um ) it's not that i have to have it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-d4	it's just something that i like you know
counselor.res	you like
client.r-4	like a different kind of high and just relaxes me right
counselor.fa	sure
counselor.res	feels good
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-4	and um i know i got things i have to worry about but at that time i just don't worry about it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-4	( you know ) it gives me like a recess
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r-4	and i get back and then the things i have to worry about to take care of too so i try to do that
counselor.fa	sure
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i just take a break from it ( and ) and i start worrying again when it's done
client.o-4	so i know it's still there i just don't forget about it like some people do and just keep going can't do that
-	-
counselor.gi	i like ( this ) this idea of a recess that you call it
client.fn	uh-huh
client.fn	oh
counselor.res	you said it feels kinda like a recess
counselor.res	( you know ) and i imagine ( you ) you take a little break you have this opportunity
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.o+4	but i'm still using so
-	-
client.o+4	( it's you know ) i'm not trying to let it get any worse
counselor.fa	sure
client.r+a4	i can't because there's a lot of things i have to take care of
client.r+4	as far as my girlfriend's apartment my mom's i pay rent there too so
client.r+4	and my kids ( you know ) so they're always asking for something
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( so you know ) but they're mostly grown now
client.fn	so ( you know ) if i have [du] they got their own too
client.fn	because i like to be there if i can be there
counselor.fa	sure
-	-
counselor.quo	so how do you feel with ( your current ) your current situation
counselor.rec	( the ) the way you're using now it sounds like it you feel pretty comfortable with it
-	-
client.r+d4	yeah i just don't want it to get no worse you know
counselor.res	worse sure
client.r+4	and it can happen ( you know )
client.o+4	so uh if that happens ( i have ) i have to do something
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	( i ) i'm not trying to go there ( you know )
client.r+4	because if i block it out of my mind and do something else it's not really that bad because like you said i can always take my meds ( you know ) and just relax that way too
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	but that time capsule is ( like ) release
client.fn	and ( like ) i can take them in the morning it says ( like ) take ( you know uh ) one every ( four ) two to four hours
client.fn	and then i might take two and then i won't have to worry about it until that evening okay so i'll be alright
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+4	then i take my oxys too so take one of them with it so i'll be okay and i don't have to worry about the heroin
client.o-1	( you know ) of course [du] now i drink beer so i'll be okay a can or pint will last me most of the day i just sip on it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	but i usually have one every day so i buy ( like ) a six pack and just keep it so i don't have to run back and forth to the store
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah that's about it actually unless you got some questions
-	-
counselor.af	i appreciate you sharing
counselor.rec	it sounds to me like ( you ) you really are aware of where you don't want this to go
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+4	i've been there so and it ain't that nice to be sick
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+4	and it's bad to be incarcerated trust me it's not nice
-	-
counselor.rec	so those things getting sick the fear of incarceration the fear of losing the family the fear of losing the life that you have now which sounds like ( it's ) it's better than it was before
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	right right
client.fn	oh
-	-
client.r+4	it was terrible before
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah those things it sounds like are keeping you ( from ) from using more or for seeking out the heroin or going down that
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( my ) my main priority ( was like ) when i got out and then i started working i was doing okay
client.fn	and then i moved here of course i was in everett then i moved here because i had to move here because i had come down here to find out what i had over here that pained me so
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	came up cancer then after that i just lay low ( went ) did all my ( uh you know ) chemos and radiation
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	that took a lot out of me i wasn't even strong enough to even think about it ( you know ) so just lay low and just do what i had to deal with
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and plus ( they ) they gave me because i was in a lot of pain they had gave me ( um ) the cocktail methadone
client.fn	so [du] that i did that like i was supposed to so i wasn't in no pain i ain't got nothing to worry about
counselor.fa	hmm
client.r+d3	so i don't like ( um ) cocaine
client.r+d3	i tried it once and it's not my cup of tea i can't stand it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+d3	i like to relax don't like to be all wired up
counselor.res	wired up [laugh]
client.r+3	that's a hell of a drug you gotta chase that i've seen them all whacked out
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i don't consider myself any better
client.r+3	but man some of the faces i've been seeing
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	it sounds like ( you're not ) you're not searching
-	-
client.fn	what do you mean
-	-
counselor.rec	you're not out there searching for the drug like you did before
client.fn	no because
counselor.res	and like ( these other ) these other people using cocaine that you were talking about that are you know constantly out there seeking looking for
client.fn	oh i [du]
-	-
client.fn	i have some family that's in for it pretty bad so and they done some wild stuff throughout the family
counselor.fa	hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i can't even talk about it
client.r+3	so i know it's ridiculous
counselor.fa	sure
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah you know the consequences
-	-
client.r+3	mm-hmm i've seen them
counselor.fa	yeah alright
-	-
counselor.rec	( it really ) again it really sounds like ( you ) you know ( what's ) what's keeping you from going in that direction and again looking forward and looking at where we are right now it sounds like you're pretty comfortable with the way things are
-	-
client.r+4	yeah i am mm
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	( you've set you know ) you set a good goal of ( you know ) not going down that road ( you kn* ) you know your limits
client.r+a4	i can't
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	and that you can't go down there ( um ) sounds like it's a pretty dark place
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+4	like i said i don't have the money
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+4	( you know ) i've got things i have to pay rent and my old lady [du] help her pay rent and mom's i pay there

client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	yeah so that's just it
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	yeah just it
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	are there any changes you would like to make
-	-
client.r+d4	right now yeah
client.r-a4	but ( um ) i know i can't
client.fn	because ( the way things are where i how ) the way i'm living
client.o+4	( i you know ) i'd like them changing
client.o+4	but i don't know maybe in a few months i might ( it might ) maybe a few months ( or ) to a year i might ( you know )
-	-
client.r+4	i'm getting older too so once you get older you know you [du] done everything
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+4	so why make it even worse on your body
counselor.fa	mm
client.o+4	so i'll probably end up quitting just take my medication and let that be it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+4	so yeah i'm fifty_seven years old so i ain't getting any younger
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+4	[cough] excuse me i [du] did everything that i know of doing so i ain't trying to repeat it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm mm-hmm
client.r+4	like i said my family ain't trying to let me either
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	because some other people they're ( you know ) a lot younger so they're gonna do what they wanna do so
counselor.fa	sure
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah those supports are really important to have kinda keep you in line
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	so well ( you know from ) from my perspective ( this is ) this is what it's all about is really learning about ( how um ) how your substance use has impacted your life and kinda leaving you ( with ) with options you know with which is ( where ) what we've kinda been discussing
client.fn	okay
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	now ( is there ) is there change in the future it sounds like maybe so but right now we're comfortable with where we are and it sounds like you have really good control ( over ) over your use and that you're making some calculated decisions
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	because when i was using ( i didn't ) if i didn't have enough money and couldn't get it i'd fly off the handle

counselor.gi	yeah so [scratching] let me explain ( the i guess ) a little ( um ) so the purpose of this ( um ) kinda brief intervention is for us to talk about ( um ) some of the things that ( you ) you talked about with joey and then that includes your drug use
client.fn	okay
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	and ( uh ) we're recording it [nvv] ( um ) [nvv] to see what the ( you know kinda what the ) impact ( of ) of people ( um ) just by having this conversation what the impact is gonna be ( on ) on future drug use

client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) [nvv] and then we wanna have a record of what the [scratching] ( um ) what the conversation was like

-	-
client.fn	i don't eat breakfast too much
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r-2	but i have to eat up one good solid meal at night to maintain my weight ( which i'm ) you know
-	-
counselor.res	right so you feel like ( you you're ) you're needing to smoke marijuana so that you can
-	-
client.fn	yeah

counselor.res	eat
client.r-2	to eat
counselor.rec	yeah otherwise
client.fn	you know just
-	-
client.r-2	i won't eat [laughs]

-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i don't
-	-
client.fn	know
client.r-2	but i know it helps me
client.r-2	and i know when i get done with my dinner at night i have a good full healthy meal or healthy whatever [nvv] dinner is gonna be for that night
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	( it's ) it's usually [du] nights and ( i'm ) i'm in

counselor.res	right so you don't smoke marijuana other times only before dinner
-	-
client.fn	only before dinner
client.o-2	oh i go it if i feel i got hungry and i wanna eat i'm getting a craving i know i have to eat then like i say it's not sit there and just smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	i might take three hits of it and i'm done
client.r-2	and i'll wait an hour then i got a food craving in me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and like i said i don't know if that's psychological i haven't figured that out yet
-	-
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	but my old lady knows it and she knows why i do it
client.fn	'cause she don't see me do it no other way but when i get ready to eat some food
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	you know she says that could be a psychological problem but i don't know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	it's i know it helps me eat
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	you know [nvv] so i became a diabetic
client.r-2	then i know i'm really losing my weight now see i same weight i am but my body mass is getting small my muscles are gone
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	so i know i have to keep that food in me you know
-	-
counselor.res	so you know it's important to eat and eat right as a diabetic and your
client.fn	mm-hmm mm-hmm right yeah
-	-
client.fn	and i have to eat so or
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	[coughs] i haven't eaten not one thing all day today not one thing
-	-
counselor.fa	hmm
-	-
client.fn	you know
-	-
counselor.rec	right which is ( a little ) a little risky if you're a diabetic to not eat yeah
client.r-2	yes it is
client.r-2	for me yeah
-	-
client.fn	and i know having this three o'clock
client.fn	and i've been running since [movement] six_thirty this morning
-	-
counselor.fa	wow
-	-
client.fn	in the afternoon not one piece of and had no craving to eat you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so i don't ( i don't like ) i haven't talked to him about that 'cause ( i don't you know ) i don't like to put my business out there
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	but since this came up i say this is probably a good opportunity for me
-	-
counselor.quc	to talk with your doctor about it
client.fn	right maybe for
counselor.fa	all right
-	-
client.fn	whoever see what this come up with the research
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and then maybe i should talk to my doctor about
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	you know i haven't mentioned that because i don't know what it is you know
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	next thing it's three o'clock and i'm still not hungry
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah well that's not a bad idea
counselor.gi	i mean if you're having some concerns about
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	your appetite
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	and ( you know ) that ( you're ) you know you gotta eat because you have to maintain your blood sugar level right
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	sugar right
-	-
client.fn	right
-	-
counselor.gi	then it's probably not a bad idea [nvv] yeah
-	-
client.fn	and [pauses] it's but once i do i know it shoots down my blood sugar pretty high
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	so you know but i also watch what i eat now
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so and i think and that's why i'm losing weight too 'cause i changed my eating habits you know
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	you know so yeah
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r-2	so that's my reason for that
client.o-2	and that's the only time i do that you know

-	-
counselor.quc	say that again the
client.fn	viagra
-	-
counselor.fa	oh okay yeah
-	-
client.fn	but they're not working correctly
client.r+1	( and ) and that could be 'cause i drink you know
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+1	so yeah and that could be the reason for that you know
-	-
counselor.quc	so are you thinking ( the ) the cocaine is ( a ) something that makes or what you're saying is it ( b* ) makes it more pleasurable or it makes it just possible
-	-
client.r-3	makes it more pleasurable and possible you know yeah
counselor.fa	okay

client.fn	yeah
client.fn	nuh-uh
client.fn	and because
-	-
client.fn	the pills ( that ) that automatic
client.r-3	the cocaine is usually automatic when you when i'm all ready but i be in it just it automatically stimulates me
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	but the pills it doesn't do that yet
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	it hasn't had[err] that effect
client.fn	that has to be at the he told me that's a desirable thing you have to have the desire[err]
-	-
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	for when you have the viagra or cialis
client.fn	and if you ever had the desire
client.r-3	you know with the cocaine you know what i mean it gives me a desire automatically
-	-
counselor.fa	okay

client.fn	i do know that you know
-	-
counselor.res	so you're thinking a little bit about some of these things being psychological

client.r-1	and i think that's a genetic thing you know what i mean you know i believe that's where that's coming from yeah
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	all right
client.r-1	matter of fact i know it is 'cause my sister has the same problem
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-1	you know so it's a family thing

client.r-1	in the family yeah
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-1	i know there is you know so
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.rec	[nvv] so then you know on the one hand it sounds like there are some positive things about cocaine use about marijuana use
-	-
client.fn	right

counselor.rec	on the other hand it sounds like you're pretty aware of some of well of
client.o+2	i'm very aware of that
counselor.quc	so what can you tell me a little bit about what those awareness or ( what ) what you're aware of that's

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	cocaine ( it's ) i think it's bad
client.fn	but marijuana i have my thoughts about that and i've been listening to the news and a whole bunch of people got their[err] thoughts about it is it good legal or whatever
client.r-2	'cause i never [coughs] got i guess if i went when i was younger i smoked it never affected me i never had hallucinations[err] i never did that
client.r-2	and just most of the time you just got hungry you know
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-2	you know and other than that s i don't see it ( wh* and ) and it hasn't been a medical thing to me i've seen that of where it affects your body

counselor.rec	( l* ) like lack of energy and not being able to get up as a way to not use so much right
client.fn	right
client.fn	yeah

counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	military you know i've been around ( some some ) some worse stuff than this

-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o-2	which i have done you know
counselor.rec	right well

client.fn	well ( i you could s* ) you could see those steps coming i can see those steps coming down the line you know
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.res	so you're aware of that
client.fn	[du] waiting for all that stuff you know
counselor.fa	all right
client.fn	i have you know ( back in when i was in ) when i was 18 19 ( then i ) when it went into a situation like that before where you didn't have nowhere to go and stuff then you learn you'll learn from your past you know
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and that's what i've always done you know
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( and it ) and it does come i believe that everything you done been through life somewhere down the line comes back and you'll see it again and that's how i think you know
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	and then i'm smarter this time okay so i just
-	-
counselor.res	so you learned from your experiences

counselor.rec	what changes yeah
client.fn	what changes in a marriage but i let her know there is changes all right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm

-	-
client.fn	the vows i meant very much and i was trying to honor those vows
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and once it got outside that hey it didn't make those vows don't mean nothing you know

client.fn	and it never changed
client.fn	and i went to i was seaman for over twenty years
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and ( uh ) when you go out there when you become a merchant seaman it's not like being in the navy

counselor.rec	yeah it sounds like you've had some pretty amazing experiences
client.fn	oh i
-	-
client.fn	i've seen some things that some people probably would never ever see you know you know
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and as a black man as a young black man ( you know i ) and i just stopped going to sea you know it got old
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	but when you're out there you only got twenty people on a boat when i'm with merchant all you could do is just drink drink drink it wasn't nothing else you know

counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+8	if it can be done if there's a medical thing that i could ( take ) make me say i don't have to do that no more i don't do that no more i'll go that route
-	-
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	you know
-	-
counselor.rec	so what you're saying is if there was ( a ) something you could take that would increase your appetite something that you could take that would help with some sexual stimulation right ( um )
client.fn	right

-	-
client.fn	but another i'm not
counselor.quo	how does that work
client.fn	but the alcohol
client.o-2	actually you know the marijuana that's easy 'cause i don't do that that much

client.fn	and i'm gonna eat my dinner and i'm going to watch a movie or ( watch ) i usually watch the news

counselor.res	across the street okay
client.r-1	everything is in i live in an area where i'm convenient
-	-
counselor.rec	right so it sounds like ( it ) things don't get out of control when you're doing it at home and you're doing in your own space right but you're still maybe feeling like boy it'd be better good to maybe drink a little less
client.fn	you know
client.o-1	no i don't go out of control
client.fn	in my space yeah
client.fn	i know
-	-
client.fn	well i got ( i'm also a cl* i'm a club and i got ) i remember i'm in this club ( there's some ) there's gentlemen's club all men and it's a very unique club but that's a new club

-	-
client.o+1	well i'm probably gonna go see the counselor
client.o-1	and i don't know

counselor.fa	yeah
client.r-1	that that's a craving ( i ) like i say i learned that from where that craving never left you know

client.o-1	and it's probably one of the things that's gonna probably if i really really get real sick then that's gonna make me think again you know
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+1	and i'm trying not to get to that point so i'm really trying to control it
client.r-1	i don't know ( what it is ) why i'm [pauses] he says my liver[err] are fine my ( al* ) i'm all right you know

-	-
counselor.gi	yeah i don't know if they bill or not for ( um ) i don't think that they do
counselor.gi	you mean ( the there may be ) there'll be a charge for i think just coming and meeting with somebody here in the clinic
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) but you could do it on the same day as your primary care doctor and it wouldn't be anything extra for that
client.fn	oh okay

counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i mean 'cause see what they got to say you know
counselor.nc	[sighs]
client.fn	i'll make time for that
-	-
counselor.gi	and i also wanna share with you ( what um ) the results of ( what the what ) those tests that you took or one of the ( um ) surveys that you did
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) and it was called the drug_abuse_screening_test
counselor.gi	and it was one of the things that you had done with joey
-	-
client.fn	right
-	-
counselor.gi	and it rates someone's ( um ) [nvv] ( uh ) risk in terms of how much ( um ) harm they may be ( in um in ) in depending on their drug use
-	-
client.fn	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	and the risk ( um ) runs from zero as no risk to ten which is severe risk
counselor.quc	and by the way that you answered your questions ( um [nvv] i would ) just i guess curious as to what you think your risk might be ( from ) going from zero risk to ten as being the highest risk the risk of harm from drug use
-	-
client.fn	harm
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah
-	-
client.r-1	well ( i ) you know my like i say to me marijuana i don't i had to ask i don't ( if ) if some if somebody done shown me statistics it would harm ( i ) i done seen a few i didn't believe in those statistics about marijuana
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r-1	or they wouldn't be talking today about legalizing or not legalizing 'cause that stuff on the news [coughs]
counselor.fa	right
counselor.res	so you
-	-
counselor.res	your perception of marijuana is pretty low risk of harm right
client.fn	yes
client.fn	harm
-	-
client.fn	yeah that was what was mine you know
counselor.quo	so what would
counselor.fa	right
client.r-1	matter of fact i'll probably ( s* ) you know i think that's what the indians used to smoke back in the old days you know a lot of this or peyote or whatever you wanna call it you know and they ain't seemed to to have a lot of [du]
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	right
counselor.quo	so
-	-
counselor.quo	what about ( uh ) ( um )
-	-
client.r+1	alcohol is bad
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r+3	cocaine is bad
client.fn	those things
-	-
counselor.rec	those two things would be sorta higher risk ( for ) for you right
client.fn	[du]
client.r+1	for me yeah
client.fn	yeah and i don't
counselor.quo	so where do you
-	-
client.fn	and i don't do ( the ) the cocaine is done like the alcohol
client.r+1	my problem is if i didn't do the alcohol i probably wouldn't do nothing you know you know you know
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	so ( what ) where would you rate yourself in terms of what you feel like your risk of harm is from alcohol and cocaine
-	-
client.fn	from one to ten
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah
-	-
client.fn	i bet it's a half five
-	-
counselor.res	five okay
-	-
client.fn	mm-hmm mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	well ( you're ) your score came out in that sorta ( moderate ) moderate risk range
client.fn	oh
counselor.gi	which is three to five
-	-
client.fn	yeah right
-	-
counselor.gi	so you were your you've got a pretty good perception of that then if you kinda trust this scale it's rating
client.fn	right
client.fn	right
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	i mean i'll ( go ) go to [du] then i would i said five
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i would take those two the alcohol and if i did do the cocaine that would
-	-
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	be a five that's half that's the risk of my harming myself do you know
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+1	i know alcohol is harming me and it always harmed
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	it's ( an* ) that's one thing but yet they sell it
-	-
counselor.gi	sure oh they still sell it it's legal
client.nc	[laughs]
-	-
client.fn	yeah right you know
-	-

client.nc	[laughs]
client.fn	yes
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	and what you feel like maybe you[err] ( have ) have thought about changing and how you would go about that ( um )
client.o+1	but that
-	-
client.o+1	that one would be a good change
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+1	and it would probably change everything else you know if you get to do it
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	'cause alcohol always make you
client.r+1	you know between the two alcohol and cocaine that's ( a ) a pretty harmful substance to have in a body you know
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+1	you know yeah and it will you know and sex ( that ) that next day ( you be ) i be wore out [laughs] you know so
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	okay

client.fn	and the doctor done told her don't be drinking no more and so she's not listening
client.r-1	( i am ) my doctor didn't say my liver was bad
client.r+1	( uh ) you know but ( um ) [nvv] you know i don't know the tolerance i have is way more than people think you know
client.fn	like i say i done had a lot of years' experience

-	-
client.r-2	( the feet and the ) the feet all my life
client.r-2	my knees within the last ten years
client.r-2	my back i got hurt back in the i think mid_seventies and it's been bothering me ever since it doesn't bother me all the time but it bothers me most of the time
client.fn	i don't take a lot of pain pills
client.fn	i was at one time ten years ago a cocaine addict
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r+4	i'm terrified of taking any kind of narcotic drug so i don't do that
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r-2	marijuana's the only one i take because i can't take that potent every day
client.fn	because i'm messing with i been taking that a long time too
client.r-2	so i use marijuana the smallest amount that takes the pain makes the pain tolerable
-	-
counselor.quo	okay how long you been using marijuana then
-	-
client.fn	off and on since i was fifteen
client.fn	i quit for let's see when i was sixteen and i didn't start again until i came out here when i was thirty_seven
-	-
counselor.rec	that's a long time in between many many years
client.fn	well that wasn't
-	-
client.fn	a part of my life you know [du]
client.fn	i mean i'm not type a personality
client.fn	so i don't really drug was never really my thing
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and when i did get hooked on cocaine it was because of the people i was around all the time
client.o+3	i'm totally against cocaine and i think you should be shot selling dealing all that
client.fn	but you know i got hooked on crack for about three years and then i went through self you know gettin' off and you know i guess cold turkey well not cold turkey lot of praying a lot of cold turkey
-	-
counselor.res	okay so you quit on your own cold turkey about ten years ago
-	-
client.fn	about ten years ago
-	-
counselor.res	and you used it for three years
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah that's a long time
-	-
client.fn	yeah i was up to about fifteen_hundred_dollars a day
-	-
counselor.res	wow ( that's ) that's amazing
-	-
client.fn	ah that's a lot that was a lot of coke
counselor.fa	wow so
client.r+d3	but i didn't like it so i got rid of it
-	-
counselor.fa	um-hum um-hum
-	-
client.r+6	and the only reason i don't smoke it is because i would say i had to make a choice either i smoke or i do my weed
client.r+d6	and cigarettes i didn't like that
client.r-2	( no ) no just cigarettes so i quit that and i smoked weed instead
-	-
counselor.fa	okay okay
-	-
client.o-1	so like i said and alcohol is not my big thing
client.o-1	i do drink but it's not my big thing
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.o-1	i mean i'm not you know i don't
-	-
counselor.res	you're not an alcohol drinker much
client.o-1	no
-	-
client.o-1	i'm not a fast drinker i'm not a i get a buzz i get a few drinks and then i'm talking like okay i know that's it bye and go home you know
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like when you started cocaine years ago that was because of ( the social ) the social influence
-	-
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	my life's been complicated i'm going to therapy now so i mean it's not for this
client.fn	i had a weight problem i weighed during that time ten years ago i was about six_hundred_something
client.fn	so i had and i was the reason i got on cocaine was because i wanted to lose weight
client.fn	everybody i know that was big been on cocaine for six seven months look at them now they're skinny as hell
client.fn	so i figured what the hell and since i was having so much problems with everything else i was doing i needed to deaden a lot of you know things that was going on in my head
client.fn	i hadn't started therapy yet
client.fn	um i did it it didn't work i got hooked like i said i was out about fifteen_hundred_dollars a day
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r+3	and then i got tired of it and i quit
-	-
counselor.af	yeah well i really admire your ability to actually quit after
-	-
client.fn	same way with cigarettes
-	-
counselor.af	so many years and going cold turkey at that
counselor.rec	so you know it sounds like you're having a lot a lot of praying a lot of will power and
client.fn	that's a lot of praying a lot of praying a lot of praying
-	-
client.r+d3	well i don't know about will power it was just that it wasn't something that i liked and it didn't i didn't enjoy it
client.r+d3	and you don't enjoy something it's easy to get rid of it if you don't enjoy it and i didn't enjoy it so i didn't do it
-	-
counselor.fa	right so
-	-
client.fn	it doesn't mean that i still have the habit i still smell it i still get the feeling in my hands my throat and i go walk by somebody smoking i still get the craves for it
client.r+d3	it just means it's something i don't like and it's never something that i was enjoying so i don't do it
-	-
counselor.af	right but you managed to stay quitting right
-	-
client.fn	yeah i had my first year or two years i had my problems
counselor.af	terrific
client.fn	( but ) but eventually just say eventually quit it came to the point where i don't need it i gotta quit
counselor.fa	sure
client.fn	everybody who i was hanging around who did it that's a good way of doing it
-	-
counselor.af	yeah well that's great it's good to hear that
-	-
client.fn	the marijuana is
-	-
counselor.res	yeah the marijuana piece you started using when you were a teenager and you quit and then you got on it again years later
client.fn	i got well actually
-	-
client.fn	i got lucky when i was fifteen going to military school i fell in with a group of guys who were inhaling it because they were shooting it
client.fn	but for some reason one dude did not like the idea of me doing it so ( he made me ) he would not let me do any drug except he would let me smoke a little weed and that was it
client.fn	and i mean he was fanatical about it i mean i went to military school four years so was he so i never was ever around anywhere you know cause we were always there and he friends you know so he knew all the people in there and he knew and it was just something
client.fn	plus i was taking karate and he was you know he really wanted me to get into this karate thing and i was in it
client.fn	so i just never got really into drugs drugs were never a big thing back then
client.fn	alcohol wasn't even a big thing for me back then i mean you know you drunk a beer with your mom you know i had my moments
client.fn	but like i said i'd get to that point the body says ah no i just quit and i just stopped
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so it sounds like you're able to recognize you know physically ( and ) and you think about it that you're able to stop that you have a you know you can
client.fn	yes
client.fn	but i can
-	-
client.fn	i can say this it doesn't mean it always happens
counselor.ec	you have a choice
client.fn	but eighty_percent of the time you know at least better than fifty_percent i can just tell it to go away and it'll just go away and not be there anymore
client.r-2	now the weed like i said it's mostly for the pain
-	-
counselor.quo	how long have you been doing the weed since you got back on it
-	-
client.fn	uh eighty_six eighty_seven off and on for about three or four years
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r-2	really hard for the last ten because that's been the most pain that has been really i mean pain we're talking [du]
-	-
counselor.res	so your weed use has increased in the last ten years
client.fn	no my weight has
-	-
client.fn	decreased in the last ten years
-	-
counselor.res	it's decreased
-	-
client.fn	three_hundred_forty pounds so far
-	-
counselor.res	oh i'm sorry ( i ) your um
-	-
client.fn	i was six_forty_something six_thirty_something
-	-
counselor.res	yeah you did say that earlier
-	-
client.fn	and i lost it and i'm now down to three_something
-	-
counselor.af	that's terrific i mean that's a lot of work
-	-
client.fn	no i've gained a little bit of it back so i know ( that's ) that's bad
-	-
counselor.af	that's a lot of that's a lot of work though
client.fn	but i walk
-	-
client.fn	so that's my way of exercising
counselor.af	good
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah i mean exercise is a big thing with weight loss now
counselor.st	when i said your marijuana use increased
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	when the pain started to become more unbearable
-	-
client.fn	yeah i i actually you know when i lived in portland for a while before i came up here in eighty_two they had some guys down there trying to get a smoke
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	and when i smoked weed that was down there it was not the weed that i smoked when i was in florida when i was a kid
client.fn	it was a hell of a lot stronger and it was totally different
client.fn	i got seed bud i didn't know what any of that was it really scared the hell out of me because i thought they put pcp [du] because it was so strong i was like uh oh
client.fn	it actually scared me
client.fn	and i didn't do it for three years until i came up here and then i was with a group of guys and then they showed it to me and it was weed and i could tell it was weed and it wasn't you know and i trusted them and i started smoking
client.o+2	it wasn't that bad and then i you know became a weed addict
client.fn	[du] so it was i learned and then i started doing it again and then ( i back in the )
client.fn	i dislocated this knee first then i dislocated that knee i dislocated each knee about four times apiece this one i think six times because of my weight i was [du]
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and it was always bad always bothering me and they wanted to do surgery but i was too big and they wouldn't do it because you know and all that stuff
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	so and they wanted me to do surgery but the doctor wouldn't let 'em told me not to do it told me he wanted me to do exercise and some other way i was like cool
-	-
counselor.af	well you lost an incredible amount of weight
-	-
client.fn	yeah and i walked that's all i do
counselor.res	and doing the exercise regularly
client.fn	just walk that's all i do just walk
-	-
counselor.res	so that has that alleviated some of the pain in your knees and
client.fn	yeah it's alleviated
-	-
client.ts+2	the knees alleviated the pain and i'm not doing it like i used to because i used to do an eighth a day
-	-
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
client.fn	now i maybe do a bowl and a half maybe two
client.o-2	[du] small little bowls not real big
client.o-2	it's not like like i said it's not like i
client.fn	but i do do it and so i have to say i do it because they asked and i told 'em i'd tell the truth
-	-
counselor.quo	okay so how often ( do you ) would you say you do it now
-	-
client.fn	almost every day
-	-
counselor.res	okay so you do use it daily
-	-
client.r-2	but not almost every almost every day but the last thirty days it's been because i've been in pain the last thirty days because of my feet my knees
client.fn	but you'll see it's probably a couple times a week
-	-
counselor.fa	okay okay
-	-
client.fn	you know ( and ) and then cause you know and then that's when i don't have it or i don't use it or i don't need it or take my ibuprofen
client.fn	you know cause i take eight_hundreds i only take a couple of them a day because you can't keep doing that i've been doing it for ten years [du]
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
client.fn	i think i'm gonna get a bunch of kidney damage sooner or later and i get 'em checked
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+4	so i mean like i say and i won't take the other stuff they want to give me because most of it is narcotic and i'm terrified of getting hooked on narcotics again
client.o+2	which is stupid because then i'm hooked on marijuana which makes no actual sense
client.r-2	but hey to me marijuana's a plant it's not a drug yet
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	so
-	-
counselor.rec	so you say that you don't want to take narcotics because of the addictive factor
client.o+4	i won't take narcotics
-	-
client.o+4	i don't take narcotics
-	-
counselor.rec	and marijuana i mean you sort of caught yourself there marijuana still
client.fn	but it's not
-	-
client.fn	you know ( i ain't ) i know everybody likes to say it's a starter and all that stuff
client.r-2	but truthfully marijuana is more just to kick the pain
client.r-2	and keeps me so i can eat sometimes when i need to eat
client.fn	i mean i'm a guy who's lost three_hundred and over three_hundred_forty pounds before so [laugh] i mean i'm doing something right
-	-
counselor.quc	um-hum would you say that marijuana increases your appetite or decreases your appetite
counselor.quc	or it sort of
client.fn	it
-	-
client.fn	depends on how i use it
client.fn	if i'm using it just for the pain no it doesn't increase my appetite or decrease it at all it's just for the pain and that's how i use it
client.r-2	if i have days where i'm not eating because of the pain and other stuff ( then i can ) then i smoke more of it then i'll get the hunger and i'll eat
-	-
counselor.res	yeah you know that marijuana has that that effect
client.r-2	it does have
-	-
client.r-2	the effect
client.fn	i mean i've used it a long time i know yeah lot of tips and stuff
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quo	well what other health problems do you think is linked to your drug use
client.r-2	well sooner
-	-
client.r-2	or later it's gonna start affecting my lungs i know that
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+2	but i try not to that's what i'm i mean i dream that i talked to my therapist and we've been dealing with my dream is sooner or later i'm gonna get off it
client.r+d2	because that's what i want
client.r-2	but it's also tough because i use it recreationally
client.r-2	and for substituted pain so it's tough
client.r-2	plus i have people i run around with that do it so that's tough too
-	-
counselor.rec	so it's pretty hard when you have to deal with the pain pretty regularly and then you're surrounded by people who
client.r-2	almost daily
client.r-2	like right now
-	-
client.r-2	sitting here just being here it's starting to bother me
counselor.rec	who use
-	-
counselor.rec	it regularly
counselor.su	so that's a tough situation to be
-	-
client.o+2	yes and so i try
-	-
counselor.quc	okay so say on a scale of one to ten how important is it to stop using for you
-	-
client.o+2	ten
-	-
counselor.res	ten okay
counselor.rec	that's pretty high
-	-
client.o+2	i know
client.fn	which means when is it gonna happen and am i gonna let it happen that's something else right there
counselor.quc	yeah ( have you ) have you thought about that
client.fn	yeah but that's next week in my therapy
client.fn	so i'm not gonna deal with it right now we're dealing with the weight thing and my other psychological things that i gotta deal with you know so
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like right now it's not a priority for you your priority is the health problem and
counselor.quo	tell me about some
client.fn	my health problem
-	-
client.fn	my health problem and my psychological problem my depression
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	because you know you asked me about that depression and all that other stuff that i'm dealing with
client.fn	and the marijuana it's there it's something we talk about
client.o-2	but it's not something i'm putting time in on because it does what it's doing
client.r+d4	and i really don't want to take any other pills i'm taking seven now for my diabetes and all the other crap i gotta do
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	so you know it's just something that
-	-
counselor.res	yes yeah sounds like you've got some health issues there
-	-
client.fn	yeah well you know i been diagnosed diabetic and then that was about twelve years ago and i've been dealing with that
client.fn	that's how they found out you know all this weight and diabetes because of the weight
client.fn	i'm down i'm pretty normal now i mean i've got a bunch of
client.fn	i want to know because on the first oh no on the seventh i come and have my bloods done
client.fn	my last bloods in january was actually normal all normal in the right range [du] right range
counselor.fa	um-hum
counselor.fa	range
client.fn	yeah ac1s about five_point_nine
client.fn	i mean i'm you know like i said i've been working on this for ten years so i mean it's hard it's hard
counselor.su	yeah i mean
-	-
counselor.su	diabetes ( is a ) is a tough thing to deal with let me tell you
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.fn	my blood sugar is averaging about one_ten
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	that's excellent
client.fn	no
-	-
client.fn	i mean it was up there about seven eight_hundred so
-	-
counselor.af	yeah but that's excellent though i tell you one_ten for a diabetic
client.fn	[du]
client.fn	and i mean
-	-
client.fn	( i ) i worked very hard
client.fn	i mean it's not something that i mean i work at taking my pills and all this stuff
client.r+1	except when i'm drinking and i'm trying to cut the drinking out because that's not helping
client.r+1	and that's putting more weight back on
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.r-1	my mom died last year so i'm drinking over that
-	-
counselor.rec	okay well it sounds like you've thought about things you know having been through experiences and educating yourself and being a little more proactive about
-	-
client.fn	i am more proactive
client.fn	( i ) for the last ten years it's been very educational cathartic however you want to put it it's been very good for me
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.fn	because it's helped me clarify a lot of things
client.fn	you know i mean i work hard at it
client.fn	and the only reason i'm here talking to you is because that's part of the thing
client.fn	and i told her that i go to therapy you know but i didn't mind coming up here talking to you
-	-
counselor.af	well i do appreciate that [laugh]
-	-
client.fn	i have no problems
-	-
counselor.res	now earlier you said that the negative thing about using marijuana is you know sooner or later it's gonna affect your lungs
-	-
client.r+2	everything affects the lungs sooner or later
-	-
counselor.fa	okay well
-	-
client.fn	it's gonna cigarettes you know
client.fn	and like i said i had a choice cigarettes or the weed
client.r+d6	and i didn't like the cigarettes that much
client.fn	so i smoked weed
client.r+d6	i still like cigarettes
client.r-6	i only do
client.fn	[du] my therapist says because i'm so comfortable and relaxed when i'm around her
client.r-6	[du] my best friend she smokes and when i'm out there i seem to smoke
client.fn	and i don't know why i smoke
client.r+d6	because i really don't like smoking
client.fn	but i do it anyway
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	and then when i leave or i'm gone i don't smoke anywhere else
client.r-6	but when i'm around her or with her you know
client.fn	which is really bizarre because i'm just not a big smoker
-	-
counselor.rec	right so it sounds like your social circle is pretty important to you and it sounds like it's also related to how you whether you're gonna smoke the marijuana or smoke cigarettes
-	-
client.fn	no i have a lot of friends who don't do any of that
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and i you know i deal with them
-	-
counselor.ec	so you do have some control over that kind of
client.fn	oh yeah
-	-
client.fn	i do
client.fn	but see it's you know and most of them know that i smoke
client.r+2	i don't smoke around them 'cause they have a lot of kids and i'm really into not smoking around kids and all that
client.fn	but i do tell them that i have
client.fn	you know they do know because i've let them know like my knees are really bad today and my body's hurting and i you know
client.o-2	and they can deal with it because i don't get all violent and all that stuff
client.fn	i'm pretty mellow [du] fall asleep
counselor.nc	laugh
client.fn	but i don't do it like i don't do it around them you know
client.r-2	i do it when i'm at home or when i come home i do it i usually just do it at home so i can lay down you know and stuff
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so it sounds like when you do use it you think enough ahead to keep yourself safe
-	-
client.o-2	oh yeah like i said i been doing this a long time and ( i have been and i know you know i ) don't drive you know i'm not a big one i take the bus or i'll walk mostly i walk
counselor.gi	i mean at home
-	-
counselor.af	yeah that's that's i mean kudos to you for the exercise part
-	-
client.o-2	it's just what i do in this you know
-	-
counselor.quc	now do you see any other negative things related to marijuana use
counselor.gi	because you know you're right about the first part it does impact your lungs and more so than nicotine ( smoking ) smoking does
client.fn	[du]
-	-
client.fn	yeah well it does [du] contain
client.r-2	but i've never known anybody that has cancer that smoked marijuana so i don't know
client.r+2	i know that out there i know that there's they gotta be there
client.r-2	but then you'd have to smoke the hell out of marijuana
client.r-2	because you know eighty_percent of the time you're blowing almost eighty_percent of the smoke out of you
client.r+6	cigarettes you don't cigarettes sits there you know you pull as much [du]
client.r-2	but marijuana for some reason you get rid of most of it
-	-
counselor.quc	where ( did you ) did you learn that from somebody or
-	-
client.fn	no ( i just i don't ) just the way it is with maybe it's just me
client.r-2	i just don't it's not always in me you know i smoke it inhale it chew it and then when i exhale it i always seem to exhale in a way to get it out
client.fn	it's just something
client.o-2	like i say i just don't even marijuana gets to the point where it irritates me and i stop
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i mean it's like i say i'm not a type a. i don't know maybe i'm a type c person or an e.
client.o-2	i don't have an addiction personality when addiction comes and it's there i kind of
client.r+2	except for the marijuana which i gotta say is addictive yes
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+2	i'm addicted mostly i'm pretty sure i'm addicted
client.o-2	i have my reasons for being addicted
client.o+2	but i'm pretty sure i'm addicted
-	-
counselor.res	okay yeah that's so you do recognize that you are addicted to it
client.o+2	yeah
-	-
client.o+2	people ask me and i put it down and what i tell 'em it's i am not ashamed to say that marijuana is my addiction
client.r-2	but you know i can i'm also boring as hell
client.o+2	if i have one vice now it's smoking marijuana
-	-
counselor.quc	well do you see any negative things then about using marijuana
-	-
client.r+2	yes it screws up your social life i can tell you that
-	-
counselor.quo	okay tell me more about that
client.fn	you know
-	-
client.fn	i don't know well i tell you you know i mean
-	-
counselor.quc	do you have any examples
-	-
client.r+2	well yeah if you mess with people you're with people who don't do it you can't do it when you're around them
client.r+2	if you're with somebody you're dating somebody who doesn't like it then you can't do it around them
client.r+2	so ( it's ) it can become very annoying or you have to choose your friends very well
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.r+2	and if you like somebody who isn't there when you choose you know you either have to tell 'em hey this is why and explain and if they accept it or won't accept it then you have to deal with that way
client.r+2	and it can become very annoying you know
-	-
counselor.rec	right so
-	-
client.fn	and there's nothing much i can do
counselor.rec	it's tricky
client.fn	i mean i have to tell them you know look this is what's going on this is why i have to do this is my pain
client.fn	they all think that i should take these pills and all that stuff
client.fn	and i explain to them you know lately because it seems that when i take pills the second i get i have allergic reactions to 'em
client.fn	and it's really hard to get pills
client.fn	you know i have to i carry the tb and they try to give me the medication for the tb that would have killed it and everything would be fine [du] this was about ten years ago i mean oh hell it was over twenty years ago and i had a very bad reaction to it i mean really bad i got really sick really bad
client.r-2	so i can't take that a lot of the pills that they were giving to me i can't take because i have allergic reaction
client.fn	i can't take penicillin i mean i have to
-	-
counselor.res	so you know you've tried other things
-	-
client.r-2	i've tried other things it just didn't work
counselor.res	[du]
client.r-2	my body just wouldn't do it
client.fn	i've tried taking pain pills
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r-2	most of 'em i have a reaction to 'em something reacts
client.fn	so the only thing i ever found that would help
client.fn	and this is now it's not as painful as it was but years ago it was painful i mean i could only walk a block without being crying tears it's true
client.r-2	when i walk i still have tears coming out of my eyes because i'm in so much pain you know
client.o-2	like i said they've been trying to give me narcotic things for it and i just won't do it
-	-
counselor.af	yeah the incredible amount of weight loss has that's really you know inspiring [du]
client.fn	yeah well like i say i walk
-	-
client.fn	hey look you've got four doctors coming to you well let's see three doctors four nurses and everybody is saying within six months you're not gonna be here
client.fn	they talk about digging a hole back of the building and [du] they'd come by and cover me up
client.fn	i thought they were kidding they weren't
client.fn	and we had a this is nineteen_ninety_six ninety_seven we had a fellow that flew from india
client.fn	everybody else but me had the gastric bypass surgery because i was too big
client.fn	he was the only one out of the room who said no what i want you to do
client.fn	because i first came here and i had high blood pressure this is ninety eighty_two and my blood pressure was like two_sixty over one_thirty
client.fn	i know that's really bad i was getting close to [du]
client.fn	and they wanted me to do something and another doctor here said no i want you to do this program
client.fn	and i started on this program
client.fn	and i could tell you my blood pressure since i've been here in eighty_two in this building they have a record of it and you'll see my blood pressure was quite high
client.fn	and it's come down to normal now it's been normal now for about ten years
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
-	-
client.fn	and i'm still aggravated i still want to put salt on my food unless you know i need it
client.fn	but i mean the salt's on it i'll do it you know i mean
counselor.fa	well
-	-
counselor.rec	you care about what you eat
-	-
client.fn	which is strange but you know like i said i brought my blood pressure under control
client.fn	and the weight thing was i was dislocating my knees and i just got sick and tired and i had a lot of little psychological problems
-	-
counselor.rec	you're saying that in the past and you sound like you've really come a long way and you've struggled a lot but yet here you are you've made all these life changes
client.fn	yes i'm very proud of it
client.fn	my faith my praying
-	-
client.fn	doctors tell me just don't go this stuff and you know i'm doing it
client.fn	you know i work hard you know i'm gonna be fifty_five so it's not gonna be like i can get out and do a lot of work
client.fn	but i have asked as i'd tell anybody every day is a day more than i had when they told me this ten years ago
client.fn	so you know i'm ten years longer than i thought i was gonna be here
-	-
counselor.rec	( you care about ) you care about yourself you want to take care of yourself you want to be around
client.fn	well something inside of me
-	-
client.fn	says i care about myself
client.fn	because i you know i mean it was um the diabetes then they sent me to a up to harborview to the psychological ( to ) to them
client.fn	and doctor_mccain said she was doing a research book and i went into her research program for about six months and we did this whole research thing
client.fn	and which helped me figure out that i had an eating disorder and how to fix that eating disorder
client.fn	and doing all of that she figured out that i was exposed to a lot of stress
client.fn	so in the middle of it it changed from that to a post-traumatic stress program
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.fn	which was six weeks of the most intense therapy i have ever been in in my life i swear i never wanna go through that thing again
client.fn	but it was methodic got it open it opened it up
client.fn	and then they sent me two_thousand_two two_thousand_three something like that they sent me to the doctor i'm seeing now doctor [du]
client.fn	and it was all just to get the weight so i could deal with the diabetes ( that's what i ) that's what they told me
client.fn	but i know now i know it was a whole lot more but it was just for that
client.fn	and it worked i got my diabetes under control and the therapy helped me deal with a whole lot of issues i got the food under control
counselor.gi	yeah isn't it just amazing
-	-
counselor.gi	how you know life the continuum of life and what people experience
client.fn	well i
-	-
client.fn	if i hadn't my faith wasn't there because if it wasn't for my faith and i'm praying about it all the time saying this is what i've gotta do i'm gonna do it but i'm on my faith you know
counselor.res	that's
client.fn	and the psychologic part was for just getting my head screwed back on
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah that's important to you
client.fn	so you know
-	-
client.fn	it was important and i mean without the faith i wouldn't have done any of it so
-	-
counselor.af	yeah terrific
counselor.quo	well now if you could if the time were right to make the changes
counselor.gi	since you scored a ten on wanting to quit
counselor.quo	what would that look like for you if the time were right
client.fn	well i
-	-
client.o+2	if the time was right and i could do it and they would my knees were better and they would operate and do all that stuff after two years of all that i would go into a program if we have a program or something and do it and i probably would come to the time where
client.r+d2	you see i'm at the time now when i really really really really want to quit
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r+d2	i mean i really really really want to quit
counselor.rec	yeah ten is a match there so you sound like you do
client.r+d2	i really want to quit
-	-
client.r-2	i'm just stuck in the catch twenty_two that when i quit for a while the knees just become too much and i can't walk
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r-2	the pills until they get a pill that when i take i don't have a reaction to i just got nothing else i can do you know
client.o+2	unless i get down to one_hundred_eighty_five pounds so it won't never bother me and they do the surgery on my knees which
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
counselor.res	well it sounds like there might be options
-	-
client.o-2	well now i'm in a catch twenty_two [du]
-	-
counselor.res	well you've lost all this weight and certainly the pain [du]
client.fn	yeah
client.o+2	i still got a lot more to
-	-
client.o+2	get to
client.r-2	but it's been deep pain
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.fn	but i need to go in and have them surgically fix it like they said or give me replacements or whatever they gotta do
client.fn	and then i gotta go through the rehab and do all that other stuff and hopefully they have no real big pain medicines
client.r+d2	and then i want to stop
client.o+2	and if i don't have to have the surgery and they say no surgery then i'm gonna it's time for me to just quit
client.o+2	i just have to find a way to substitute it find out something else cut the legs off whatever just so i can quit
client.r+2	because i mean and it's boring it's tiresome
client.r+d2	and you know it's there's no real enjoyment of it anymore
client.r+d2	i just don't enjoy it i don't enjoy it now
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+2	because in the summertime i'm not really hot i'm just
-	-
counselor.rec	you're maintaining that pain
client.fn	maintaining
-	-
client.fn	without the pain
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r-1	and then mama dying and then i started drinking
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r-1	because my mama died and she was ninety and you know it was tough
-	-
counselor.fa	right right
-	-
client.fn	and you know she was real sick at the end and i had to be in there and all that
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	and i had all that
client.fn	plus all the therapy and thinking of all that mess because you know it's always mama's fault
client.fn	so all the medicine you know all of that so i had all this stuff plus mama was really sick for ten years
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.fn	she has parkinson's stages of alzheimer's you know all this stuff starting to go dementia
client.fn	i never had all these feelings and all this anger of things that she would do to me but i was never able to tell her about it because of all the problems she had
client.fn	and i said well you could tell her but she might not understand a damn thing you're saying
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.fn	plus she was being mean as hell to me when i was there i mean you know
counselor.rec	this is
-	-
counselor.rec	all the stuff you're talking about working out in counseling
client.fn	it was [du]
-	-
client.fn	the last we're talking about in the last three years
client.fn	within the last year before she died she would when no one was around she would look at me and tell me how stupid i was and how smart [du]
-	-
counselor.res	and that must have been
-	-
client.fn	it was really i mean i had to go i mean they all say that it's part of the disease and all that
client.fn	but i'm like hey you're not the one that she's saying and this is not like it's new this has been all my life
client.fn	you know when i was real young they didn't know the thing i had was dyslexia he was semi-retarded
client.fn	so you tell two very educated very phds highly educated people that you have a semi-retarded son they never looked at me as normal ever again in my life
counselor.su	yeah that must have been really hard to hear
client.fn	even the day i died she never looked at me as capable of doing anything
-	-
counselor.su	but look here you are
-	-
client.fn	well i am i'm just saying that i have all that and then she died and i never got to deal with it
client.r-2	so i've got all that anger and depression and all that going and all these emotions and the only thing that really helps me deal with it is when i get a little crazed i smoke
counselor.res	you've got all these emotions coming at you and
client.r-1	or i've been drinking 'cause smoking doesn't work but then i drink
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so it sounds like then using marijuana also helps you know mentally and emotionally
client.r-2	it helps me
client.fn	because my walks
-	-
client.fn	are cathartic because my walks are therapy help me i do most of my thinking most of my getting my head cleared most of my putting stuff into little boxes doing all that
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.fn	when i walk i walk six miles i was walking six miles until my feet got hurt
-	-
counselor.af	that's great therapy
-	-
client.fn	you know and it helps to clear it out
client.fn	and that's where most of the anger so i kind of get it out in that
client.fn	you really don't wanna talk to me when i'm walking because i can give you a look they say that could just curl your skin which i never understand because i never seen this look so
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
counselor.quo	so where do you think you go from here then at this point
-	-
client.o+1	like i said my big thing is if i had the chance or i can figure a way out the marijuana would be out of my system and be gone i'd be talking to you about the alcohol
client.o-1	i don't drink a lot but i mean it's give me something to talk about
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.o+2	but like i say you know and i am working on it
client.r-2	it's just that with all this other crap with it present with the thing
client.fn	because i've always looked at it as such a small thing you know it wasn't the most pressing thing in the way
client.r+2	now it's becoming one of the most because i've got to live with all the other crap it's becoming the most pressing thing
client.r+2	because it's the thing that keeps me the most clouded
client.r+2	and it's kind of hard to be fifty_five and want to be you know unclouded
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah well you've lived a long time with all this stuff you're dealing with and you're continuing to deal with things
client.fn	you know
client.fn	yeah
counselor.su	so that's you know that's very very difficult but
-	-
client.fn	i made your day didn't i
-	-
counselor.rec	well on the other hand here you are though you know ( you're ) you're a success in many ways because you've lost over how many three_hundred_pounds your health started improving when you were doing that you sought help you're seeing a counselor to work out all of these things from childhood time and you know that impacted who you are today and it's sort of helping you deal with everyday stress too and you want to change on a scale of one to ten you say you want to do a ten but you're so worried about how it's going to manage your pain if you do quit
client.fn	[du] and manage
-	-
client.fn	my pain and also she wants to give me anti you know anti-anxiety [du] for my depression and all that that comes in there
client.o-2	and i am going to fight her on that one
counselor.res	yeah you said you're not into the pills and
client.r-2	i'm fighting on it because well no it's not to do the pill thing because i don't want to be coming off
client.r-2	she says well don't worry about it only a few people and i'm saying she don't understand they always tell me that a few i always seem to be that two_percent that it always has a reaction to
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.r-d2	and i just don't want to go through that thing again where i have a reaction and
client.fn	i you know when i had the penicillin reaction and i got the hives and all that i mean i was in the hospital i was real sick on that one
client.r-d2	so i don't really want i'm really apprehensive about it
client.fn	i've got something that work the only reason i got the weight off was that i didn't go to the nutritionist and i had to figure that out all myself which they encourage you to do anyway but it was you know
client.r-2	so i'm just i'm apprehensive of
-	-
counselor.rec	okay sure but now you know you're sort of still on the edge and you're not ready to do it and your priority at this point really is your mental health and managing the pain at a level at a manageable level
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	doing my exercise
-	-
counselor.adw	okay so i think your options are that you can manage your using marijuana
counselor.adw	you can eliminate some of the risks
counselor.rec	and it sounds like you're doing some of that when you're saying you stay at home you're not driving
-	-
client.fn	no no no no
counselor.adw	you
-	-
counselor.adw	eliminate the risk when you're using
counselor.adw	your other option is not to change at all
-	-
client.r+d2	yeah that's an option i really don't like
client.r+d2	i really want to change
client.fn	but like i said ( i i you know ) well okay it's all on me
client.fn	i haven't ( made the ) sat down with my case worker here ( or my ) or my psychiatrist i haven't done any of that and said okay today is the day that we're gonna work on this like i've worked on everything else
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	( that's ) that's my [du] agreement and a thing like i made out for doing all this stuff and let's go there
client.fn	i just haven't done that because i know i'm gonna break it
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+2	and i know that once i start to do the stuff i really mean when i say hey this is what i wanna do i mean this is what i'm gonna do
client.fn	and when i know i ain't gonna do it i don't wanna start it ( it's not ) you know it's a waste of the people's times i don't wanna waste their time until i say i'm ready it ain't gonna work
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.adw	maybe the best thing right now is just you know knowing that being aware of that
-	-
client.fn	i keep saying it to myself i keep pushing it and then it all comes to
client.fn	like i said i'm not a type a. i don't have a type a personality
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+2	when it gets irritating i will find a way to go
client.fn	like i did before when i was sixteen because i got just tired of it when i was sixteen i was like man grrrrr i don't want this and i just quit
client.fn	no one there was no let's go here i just said quit when i did the coke i just said quit
client.fn	okay i prayed but you know what i just said quit let's quit it's time to quit and i just did it
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	and i know when it comes down
client.fn	the weight loss the same way i just said i gotta do what i gotta do
-	-
counselor.quc	so you trust your counselor then
counselor.quc	they're good for you
-	-
client.fn	all good course support and they will send me to somebody you know to help me or get me going
-	-
counselor.af	good
-	-
client.fn	you know what i mean i mean just
counselor.gi	( that's ) it's important to have that as an option too
client.fn	i would be at the hospital or i would be somewhere else if i did not think that i could get the aid i need
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	i been here since eighty_two
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah yeah
-	-
client.fn	so i mean
-	-
counselor.rec	so when you are ready to take that step you know where to go you know how to seek the help
-	-
client.fn	( and i have ) and there are people here who still ask me and they know you know
client.fn	and i'm truthful i've learned that over the years to be truthful
client.fn	see most of the folks that come see you may not be the truthful type
client.fn	i will be truthful because i know the more i'm truthful for you the more it's gonna help me
-	-
counselor.af	that's great i like that attitude
-	-
client.fn	so i mean ( i'm i'm that's ) that's not the problem
client.o-2	the problem is i just ain't ready for it
client.o-2	i just haven't figured out yet
client.o+4	oh i have for the dope
client.o-2	i haven't put in the time to do it i haven't put in the work to do it until i put in the work or until i i don't know until my psychiatrist [du] or until i sit down and say hey this is it let's do this
client.fn	i get close i just
-	-
counselor.gi	i like that plan you came up with though
counselor.ec	you know when you're ready to do it
counselor.su	just i know it's coming you have that worry about the pain and you know being too much pain
counselor.gi	but talking about surgery continuing to lose weight i mean i think those are really good options
client.fn	yeah
counselor.ec	when you're ready to do it
counselor.adw	those are good options to try
counselor.rec	it sounds like you're really working closer with your doctor too
-	-
client.fn	yeah i mean i'm excited about it
counselor.fa	[du]
client.fn	i mean i do whine about it and i [du] 'cause i do whine
client.r+2	'cause i mean i am tired of it i mean really truthfully tired of it
client.fn	if these things were i mean i know i'm not okay i'm fifty-five now but i mean ( i'm not gonna get any ) i'm not getting any younger
client.fn	i know sooner or later ( i'm gonna do ) i'm gonna mess up anyway
client.r-2	but if i could just get some relief for six months where i'm just not in pain when i get up in the middle of the nighttime to walk to the bathroom
client.fn	and you know making a [groan] kind of takes ten minutes and then you know sometimes you don't even get to the toilet before you gotta pee you know because you just can't walk faster because your legs just hurt and you're more in the concentration on that than concentrating on holding it in till you get there because the legs feel real bad
counselor.fa	yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	you know i mean i finally had to get a urine thing by my bed so i could do that there because ( i couldn't ) i just could not get to the bathroom [du] so i mean i'm just
counselor.af	yeah well you know
-	-
counselor.af	regardless of what you decide to do i think you have that sort of that determination to do it
client.fn	i got a lot
-	-
client.fn	i got determination like i said i got good help
counselor.res	[du]
client.fn	i got good people around me you know [du] a good person
counselor.res	good people right faith you have faith
client.fn	got this other woman who takes care of my feet
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.fn	you know i just saw her today she you know she's happy so she was like hah hah you know
client.fn	because actually it's true when i hurt my heel i wanted to walk but i kept hearing her voice in my head telling me are you out of your mind do you wanna walk or do you wanna have your feet or do you wanna walk
client.fn	i wanna walk so i want my feet so i gotta do what it takes
client.fn	and she said usually it takes six months for the pain the hurt that i got she said but you did it in three weeks because you did something that the other people don't do
client.fn	you actually stopped and you didn't do it and you slowed down and when it hurts you get off it i'm like yeah
counselor.fa	yeah
client.o+2	so ( i'm ) i'm hopefully by the end of this this research paper i may not see you but when i see them guys again [du] i will actually say hey i'm quitting i quit
-	-
counselor.af	that's good
-	-
client.o+2	because i mean i hope within the year i will get to the point where i mean i just
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.r+2	i am angry
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah i mean and i can tell i can tell it's an inner struggle with you
client.r+2	and it's a frustration
-	-
client.r+2	it's a frustration
client.r-d2	because i enjoy it personally
client.r-2	because it's you know it's better than drinking it's better than any of the other drugs
client.r-2	and the next day you know you won't have the after effect
client.r+2	but i also know it's stupid because you get caught being stupid
client.r+2	and he don't like that and i don't need that
-	-
counselor.af	i think no matter what though like i said i think you're strong enough you know
-	-
client.fn	well i thank you
counselor.af	to get yourself where you need to go you need to go so
-	-
client.fn	so you know i'm in good shape so

counselor.gi	mm-hmm yeah ( um ) what did i do with the okay so one of the forms ( that ) that joey had you fill out was called a ( uh ) drug_abuse_screening_test
counselor.gi	and the results of that ( range are well ) rate you on a risk scale and the risk scale is from zero to ten
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	( is ) zero is the low risk ten is the most high risk and by risk they mean ( um ) sort of ( um ) risk of harm to
-	-
client.fn	others
-	-
counselor.gi	no ( you ) well to sort of yourself in terms of ( your ) your emotional ( um ) health ( um ) [du] right

counselor.af	okay well that's good and
client.nc	[laugh]
counselor.gi	so that's what ( this um ) this scale rates you on
counselor.quc	( and ) and based on your answers what would you think ( your ) your level of risk would be

client.fn	( um ) i'd say ( a little ) kinda like a moderate
-	-
counselor.res	moderate
-	-
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	a little less than moderate
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+3	because me as far as my own concern ( is um ) i might have these feelings but i deal with them in a way ( that ) that eliminates ( uh ) i would say harm to myself

counselor.gi	this ( this ) comes out as you being ( s* ) pretty severe ( uh on the ) on the high end of risk
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	okay
counselor.quo	( how do you what do you ) what do you make of that
-	-
client.o+3	( uh ) i would say that's basically true
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-3	because ( um ) from the answers that i gave them i'm a very very stressed out extreme kinda person that [du] capable might [du] over to the end once in a while or [du] more often than i should but ( um )

counselor.st	and here's the score
counselor.gi	a dast score
-	-
client.fn	what's that mean
-	-
counselor.gi	well i'm not exactly
counselor.gi	it's the drug abuse screening test
counselor.gi	and it says what your risks are as far as to how much drugs
counselor.gi	when he did the first intake with you that you're using and it puts you you scored a six
client.fn	um-hum
counselor.gi	and it puts you up in severe risk for complications related to your drug use and that's medical probably legal
-	-
client.fn	right
-	-
counselor.gi	you know just what it's doing to your life
-	-
client.fn	right
-	-
counselor.quo	so what do you think about that
-	-
client.fn	[du]
-	-
counselor.quc	( have you ) do you have any thoughts about that
counselor.quc	( or ) or is this exactly where you thought you might be or
counselor.res	you nodded your head you know when you were looking at that
-	-
client.fn	well i mean when i'm the one who's using knowin' that um
client.fn	well let me just say this here's the thing that hits me nowadays as opposed to when i first used when i was a teenager
client.fn	is opportunity money to me is opportunity 'cause it opens doors it gives me opportunity to have shelter housing car clothes whatever
-	-
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.r+7	but when i give all my money to my drug dealer i'm giving him all my opportunity
-	-
counselor.fa	ah
-	-
client.o+7	so that's something that's really been on my mind lately
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like you've been thinking that it would be better to save your money for
-	-
client.r+7	well you would think so but that's the whole i guess the addiction the insanity of the drug ( that ) which i use
-	-
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
client.fn	you know i guess that's why they call it drugs [laugh]
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.r+7	you know cause it makes you crazy like you need to do crazy things at times
-	-
counselor.res	right right so when you say you've been kind of you've been thinking about this more
counselor.quc	has it changed you in any way or
-	-
client.r-7	well it um i guess kind of give me some kind of value
client.r+7	but at the same time it still once that maybe my day don't go right depression anger then it's automatically out the window let me get my drugs to get away to escape maybe even to be a coward you know what i mean
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
counselor.quo	tell me a little bit more about that what
-	-
client.fn	about what
-	-
counselor.gi	about how you're
counselor.rec	i mean it sounds those all sound like things that are not very making you feel very good the coward feeling depressed
-	-
client.fn	well i'm sayin' when you look at my situation
-	-
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	um those things will come up you know what i mean
client.fn	or you think you having a good day but then maybe something happens
client.fn	ooh excuse me
-	-
counselor.quo	so when you don't have a good day what happens
-	-
client.r-7	well i mean um you know you wanna use because you figure you know the day is gone it's gone
client.r-7	here's something like i'm saying get away from your problems and stuff you should go your responsibilities that you need to be doing
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.r-7	so if it don't work out then you know you wanna turn to something to ease the pain get away like i said
client.fn	or some people even call it just being a coward
client.fn	i think it's a touch of all of 'em to say the truth
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so ( when you're ) when you're going along and the day's going pretty good you don't feel like using
-	-
client.fn	right
-	-
counselor.rec	but one bump in that road and then
-	-
client.fn	right
-	-
counselor.rec	you don't ( you ) you wanna use
client.fn	or
-	-
client.fn	sometimes people say boy i'm having a shitty day or whatever
-	-
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	i need a drink you know
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	opposed to that i don't drink so
client.o-1	i mean i do but i'm not a alcoholic [du] just say that
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.r-7	but instead of me taking a drink i'll go get my drug so
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
counselor.quc	are there ever times when you have a day that you've hit that bump in the road that you don't use drugs

client.fn	hmm good times to me is like um i guess maybe the day you don't have to really worry about too much of a lot of things far as man my bills need to be paid or i got someone sick in my family i'm feeling fine you know
client.fn	you don't have to you know when you know brothers and sisters and kids if you have any they okay you know and like i said you're not really worried too much about who you have to pay or any bills going on or if it's a nice day outside and you know [du] considers you know days like that
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
counselor.rec	( and ) and those are days that you would not use any drugs
-	-
client.fn	no i wouldn't say that
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	i would say if it's free if me and you are friends and you come over around me with my drug of choice and you know my day is going fine i'm probably gonna use without it being bad ( or or ) or feeling depressed
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.fn	you know i just have to come to terms about and keep asking myself do i want anything out of life
client.o-7	if i don't want nothin' out of life stay on the same thing you know keep doin' what you're doin '
client.o+7	if i do want something out of life i gotta make a change
-	-
counselor.rec	so it sounds like you've been asking yourself that a bit
counselor.quc	is it have you been asking yourself that a bit more lately or
-	-
client.o+7	all the time
-	-
counselor.res	all the time
-	-
client.fn	lately yes
-	-
counselor.quo	okay and ( what makes you ) what makes it more something that you're thinking about now than before
-	-
client.r+7	i'm getting older have a daughter well i have a child i say she is my daughter
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.r+7	um thinking about her need to be in her life
-	-
counselor.fa	[du] okay
-	-
client.r+7	looking back at my life the age that i'm at i feel i maybe should have had figured i'd be retired from someplace and with my child and have my own home and have my own car you know
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.r+7	well i may have a few bills that's fine but i just feel this stage at my life i should be a lot further in my life
client.fn	but plus [du] i know a lot of things
-	-
counselor.quc	( how ) how old are you larry
-	-
client.fn	i'm forty_two years old forty_three in september
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	yeah
client.r+7	so i mean fifty and when i blink it's gonna be here and if i keep on this path i'm gonna be fifty with nothing
-	-
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.r+7	you know not a house car nothing
client.fn	so it's like if we go back fifty years whether it be looking at my life or your life what have you accumulated what have you got together well maybe something to call ( your ) your own you know what i mean
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.r+7	and i have to sit around that question comes to me scratching my head like wow you know a lot of time went by that i wasted
counselor.af	so
-	-
counselor.af	this is great that you're you know that you're thinking more about this i think that's ( really ) really
counselor.gi	because with every step you know thinking is kind of the beginning of a plan
-	-
client.o+7	right
-	-
counselor.quc	so do you have a plan on how you might make those changes
counselor.quc	have you thought more about that
-	-
client.o+7	um i just feel i just need maybe is to definitely work but money management skills um
-	-
counselor.quo	and tell me how that would help that money management skills
-	-
client.o+7	well like i said my opportunity is my money if i ( could ) could not give away all my opportunity
counselor.fa	right
-	-
counselor.quo	and ( how ) how might you do that
counselor.quc	have you
-	-
client.fn	i don't know i don't know yet
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.o+	but that's i think that's the area of help where i would need some help kicking the habit
-	-
counselor.quc	um-hum um-hum have you ever tried to kick the habit
-	-
client.fn	i would say maybe once other times just playing around you know i'm not into ia whatever
client.fn	but i mean take a serious effort to try to quit i would say probably once
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
counselor.quo	okay so when that serious in that time when you seriously tried to quit what'd you do
-	-
client.fn	i tried to um man probably this is crazy
-	-
counselor.gi	you know whatever works is not crazy
-	-
client.fn	you really wanna know
-	-
counselor.gi	i do wanna know
-	-
client.fn	i tried to study myself all my habits and to see when do i get all these cravings what was triggering me to want to go take that step to actually go do it you know what i mean and i was trying to focus more solely on me you know
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	and i'm talking about every little thing you know
-	-
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	and i made it it went on for about a week and a half but
-	-
counselor.quc	were you doing this by yourself or were you
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.fn	by myself i was trying to ( you know ) you know today okay i'm here i'm feeling okay and then you know what all of a sudden now you know i'm thinking okay damn i feel like i want you know to get high
client.r+7	oh wait a minute you know now you said you was gonna try to stop this madness
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r+7	but you feeling like you want to okay but don't do it because you're saying that you wanna try to kick the stuff
-	-
counselor.fa	right right
-	-
client.fn	and um like i said that was basically everything i was ( trying to ) trying to get more inside my mind to see what was you know making me you know have these cravings you know and stuff
client.r-7	and like i said i've come to the realization that one of them is definitely anger
client.r-7	and one of them is depression
-	-
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
client.r-7	them two things send me quick
-	-
counselor.rec	so ( it ) it really truly to me it sounds like you've really been thinking about this pretty hard
-	-
client.o+7	yeah
-	-
counselor.af	and that ( you've ) you've actually gone a week's time where you really worked and did probably what more than any treatment program could do
counselor.fi	no thank you
-	-
client.nc	[sigh]
-	-
counselor.af	( i ) i think that's ( really ) really very insightful and positive
-	-
client.r-7	yeah but ( it's the ) it's the human mind thing that gets me you know i mean i can't control thoughts that come in my head
client.r+n7	but the thing i must try to control is to act on 'em i gotta get that under wraps
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
counselor.af	yeah yeah but yeah that's but you i think you've got some right steps in there
counselor.gi	i think that's the getting the control of those thoughts takes practice probably
counselor.res	and ( you ) you have a week of practicing of the you know
counselor.quc	do you think about trying that again
-	-
client.fn	at times not all the time
client.r+7	but let me just say not as much as i should
-	-
counselor.quo	uh-huh what would make you put it more into practice again
-	-
client.o+7	me coming to the realization that it is time to quit and i don't mean half-assed quit you need to quit period
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.fn	you know
-	-
counselor.fa	yeah
-	-
client.r+7	because like i said i'm not getting any younger
-	-
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
client.r+7	i want something out of life
-	-
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.o+7	so i guess they call it rock bottom
-	-
counselor.quc	do you think you've hit rock bottom now
client.o+7	oh yeah
-	-
client.o+7	i've hit it plenty of times i'm at rock bottom now
-	-
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.r+7	homeless
client.r+7	jobless
client.r+7	here in another state all alone
-	-
counselor.rec	yeah yeah but with a desire it sounds like to really come to terms with this
counselor.quc	am i hearing this correctly or
counselor.rec	i'm hearing somebody that's telling me that they've hit rock bottom that they are really looking inside for the insight and the control um that you've done it in the past you know maybe a short time but it was a beginning
-	-
client.fn	yeah it seemed like i kinda knew what to do but ( i just ) it's just the act of just doing it you know what i mean
-	-
counselor.quo	what do you think might help you with that
-	-
client.fn	i don't know
counselor.quc	do you think
client.fn	maybe that's something you can answer
-	-
counselor.quc	( in support of i mean are you thinking
counselor.quc	do you
counselor.res	) you did this the last time that you had this moment where you were able to control your habit it sounds like you were doing it on your own
counselor.quc	were you housed at the time
-	-
client.fn	um yeah i wasn't homeless um
-	-
counselor.quc	was there anything special about where you were at that point
-	-
client.r+7	i think it was my daughter had a big thing um to do with that because i was seeing her then you know and by her being my only child
client.fn	i hate to say that i'm a deadbeat dad but i'm not in the terms of i'll spend all the time with her in the world
-	-
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
client.r+7	but when it's time to provide then that's where i come up short because i'm getting high
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	see what i'm saying so i don't know if people would consider it as a deadbeat
client.fn	i'm thinking when i say deadbeat dads are when how i grew up was it just you didn't wanna see her you didn't take care of her you left and you just never you know came back you just that type of thing but
-	-
counselor.fa	right
-	-
client.fn	i was there but it was just the fact of me just not being able
counselor.fa	uh-huh
client.r+7	in my mind i wanna spoil my child and all give her the world and all this stuff you know i think everybody has that aspiration when the child even before it's here you know
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.r+7	but once it's here i still gotta do things i don't say got to but i'm still doing things that's for me i guess maybe you can even call it selfish
client.fn	but ( that ) that opportunity thing like i'm saying the money thing wasn't
counselor.fa	yeah
client.fn	i mean i wasn't don't get me wrong i was not spending all my money on drugs
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.fn	but i knew i should have been doing a lot more for my daughter
counselor.fa	um-hum
client.fn	and um but like i said it was them times where i was going through this thing where you know i got a child and i need to be responsible i need to step up to the plate now be a man now you know all those things was running through my mind
client.r+7	and i still [du] you know
-	-
counselor.rec	so the family was ( really really ) really a big part of this your daughter in particular is a big part of your life
-	-
client.fn	yeah they say sometimes kids can change you you know what i mean
-	-
counselor.quc	right ( did you have ) was this during the period that you had ( your ) your really good week of thinking about
client.fn	right
-	-
client.fn	exactly exactly
-	-
counselor.st	yeah yeah well just to sort of wind us up because i know you are anxious to get out of here
counselor.af	i want to just say that you know i think that there's some if it's okay with you i just think that you've got the ability there you've got that week you know
counselor.gi	if housing is an issue there are shelter groups that are sort of religious based but that might be able to look at giving you some housing while you work on these issues
counselor.rec	because some of the issues that you talk about where you're thinking about it deep inside and trying to get that control are you know ( you've got that ) you've got that experience you've had that moment
counselor.adw	and that's something to think about
-	-
client.o+7	call it a moment of clarity
-	-
counselor.af	yeah that's a good point
counselor.res	it's a moment of clarity
counselor.gi	and this is a chance maybe if you want to have that opportunity you could continue to try that again
-	-
client.fn	i would say maybe um they call them sponsors
-	-
counselor.fa	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	i've never had a sponsor
-	-
counselor.fa	um-hum
-	-
client.fn	and
-	-

client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	did you have any questions for me before we get started or
client.fn	no
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.quo	and how did it go the whole interview process
client.fn	( it went )
client.fn	it went good good
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	yeah it's just some question ( um like you know ) the consent form why would she want my arrest record ( you know ) that's what i was concerned about
client.fn	i ain't got nothing to hide but that's what i couldn't understand why do you guys want my arrest record ( you know ) that's the only part ( i couldn't get ) i couldn't understand
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.quc	was she able to kind of explain it in a way that made a little sense
client.fn	yes she explained it yes
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	uh-huh
counselor.st	alright ( um ) so like i said today is just gonna be a brief conversation i'm just ( um ) gonna be chatting a little bit about ( um ) your drug use and if you've seen any ( you know ) positive or negative effects from it
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	and so one of the questionnaires that you filled out with us actually is called the drug abuse screening test
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	( um ) it was pretty early on in the whole list of questions it was kind of a yes or no question
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	mm
counselor.quc	( um ) and so ( uh ) would it be okay with you if i kinda go over what your score was on just the questionnaire
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	alright
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	so it's scored on a zero to ten scale with zero being ( um ) no risk from drug use and then up to ten which means that there could be potential severe risk that people report sometimes from drug use
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.gi	risk can mean anything from ( you know ) maybe medical effects or mental health effects or maybe effects that they've seen in their lives ( um ) that might produce a little more risk ( um ) because of the drug use that they have so
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	( um ) so on that scale of zero to ten where do you think you might have scored
-	-
client.o+3	about a eight
-	-
counselor.res	okay so you were thinking ( kinda ) pretty high up there
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quo	alright ( um ) and what were some of the reasons why you thought it might be an eight
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+3	because ( my my drug ) my drug use ( has got worse ) ( ha* got ) has gotten worse
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+3	and ( uh ) probably because of my health and ( me you know ) i'm h_i_v positive and ( i ) i [du] ( you know ) and i'm not on ( a* ) any kind of medication as of yet i'm not yeah that's probably why
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	okay so you think it might be drug use might be somehow related to ( um ) health issues that you're having
client.r+3	yes
client.r+3	[du] exactly
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.gi	so you actually scored a five
counselor.st	and we can kinda look at this together
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	so that's actually in the moderate risk range
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm
counselor.gi	so actually a little bit lower from what you originally thought
client.fn	mm-hmm okay
counselor.quo	so what are your thoughts about that
-	-
client.fn	( i i don't um ) i don't know [laugh] i mean thoughts like what
-	-
counselor.quc	oh i guess were you kind of surprised to hear that the number was a little bit lower
client.fn	yeah i was [du] yeah
-	-
client.fn	i was very surprised because ( i i i ) i dwell a lot on ( my my my uh ) my illness too right ( and )
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r-3	and i'm one of these i can't say no if somebody comes say you wanna get high linda and i say yeah ( you know ) i'm not gonna turn down any crack i don't that's just me or alcohol
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	okay and so ( um ) could you tell me a little bit more about your drug use
-	-
client.o+3	well ( it's got ) it's gotten worse [du] before ( um ) maybe i smoked once a month i used to smoke once a month but now it's [du] every other day
-	-
counselor.quc	okay and smoked crack
client.fn	crack
counselor.res	okay and so ( e* ) every day
client.fn	( uh ) ( i'd say ) i'd say
client.fn	out of the week i smoke four times out of the week
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+3	and ( it's ) it's gotten ( p* ) worse
client.r-3	( a* ) and it has a lot to do with no not really the building i live in everybody's got drugs right now ( you know and i ) and they knock on my door lynn do you want a hit ( you know and ) and i just say yeah
counselor.fa	mm
client.o+3	( you know ) i have to learn how to say no
-	-
counselor.res	so it sounds like
client.r+3	and then when i do smoke that crack it leads into my drinking
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.res	so it kinda triggers drinking
client.r+3	because if i don't smoke any of that i won't drink but once i start smoking crack ( i s* ) i drink
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.rec	so ( f* ) sort of like the flood gates open a little bit
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	uh-huh
counselor.res	okay and ( um ) sounds like ( it's more difficult ) the increase has mainly been because you're in an environment where people are asking a little bit more mm-hmm

counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.ts-3	and i said shoot for the last night i come someone come and got me high right i have no money ( you know ) it's just the way it is
-	-
counselor.quc	mm and so you said treatment
-	-
client.fn	i was in treatment in march or february
-	-
counselor.quc	okay for
-	-
client.fn	drug and alcohol mostly alcohol
counselor.fa	okay
client.r-3	( you know ) because i wasn't like i said since i moved in this building ( why ) i smoked crack when i was homeless and all that too but not as much as i do now where i live environment and
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	oh wow so even having a stable place to live somehow has increased it because of everything going on around it
client.fn	uh-huh
client.fn	yeah
client.r-3	( it's ) it's
client.r-3	all just in there ( you know ) yeah
-	-
counselor.quc	and so how long have you been using crack for
-	-
client.fn	about six years ( off and on ) just off and on
counselor.fa	okay
client.o+3	but like i said it's got worse
-	-
counselor.quo	and what are some of the things that you've enjoyed about using
client.fn	i used
client.fn	to go out to movies
client.fn	( about ) about crack what i enjoy about it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.gi	yeah
-	-
client.r+d3	[laugh] i don't enjoy anything about it
client.r+d3	it's just [nvv] i don't there's nothing to enjoy about it for me
client.r+3	( it ) it's depressing when you don't have any more
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	( you know ) because once you go out and get that hit you want more and more and more
client.fn	( uh and uh that's like ) i know everybody that smokes is like that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o-3	( you know ) and if it's there i'm just gonna keep smoking
client.ts+3	and ( like ) today i knew i had to come here and my friend said why don't you come over well i said no i can't ( you know ) so that stopped me this appointment stopped me from going over there to smoke and mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.af	that's good
-	-
client.r+3	and ( like uh i g* i'd make a lo* ) i've been making my appointments and i know i don't wanna go get high the night before and then not make my appointments
client.ts+3	so i kinda cut down on when i have appointments i won't smoke the night before
counselor.quc	mm and what kind of appointments do you have
-	-
counselor.quc	during the week
client.fn	with my medical doctor at harborview madison_clinic
counselor.fa	oh
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.quc	so are you going to
client.fn	[du] my arm
-	-
counselor.quc	are you going to madison
counselor.quc	( like ) how often are you going
-	-
client.fn	well ( i i go i see her once ) i won't see her until november again
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	so it's every two months i see my ( patient or my uh ) provider over there
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah see i'm gonna start on a new medication and i got the pills but i'm kinda scared too because all the ( um ) effects they tell me i ( gonna have ) might have with those pills
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( and uh ) but ( i'll ) it's the only way to find out if i take them
-	-
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	so when i get done here i gotta go take them
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+3	and i don't know if smoking crack will have any effect with that
-	-
counselor.quc	mm ( um ) have you been able to have a conversation about that with your madison social worker
-	-
client.fn	yeah mm-hmm yeah we talked about that
-	-
counselor.quo	what were some of the things that she said
-	-
client.fn	( she didn't really ) she didn't really say anything
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so she wasn't sure if there was gonna be ( a ) any kind of effect
client.fn	no she wasn't sure
-	-
client.fn	( but i um um see what i um um ) the pharmacist i'm gonna ask i'm gonna call him and tell him i smoked crack last night and i'm supposed to start my meds today if that will make me feel any different like can it get me sicker or something mm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.af	well yeah i mean it sounds good that you're kind of being proactive and checking in to make sure ( you know ) if there's gonna be any negative side effects from it
client.fn	uh-huh
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	uh-huh
-	-
client.fn	because i'm allergic to ( a lot ) about five six antibiotics
counselor.fa	oh okay
client.fn	i'm allergic to a lot of medications ( you know ) i don't want my [du] pills to be one of them ( you know )
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	but ( i they ) they know so they're aware of what kind of medica* uh antibiotics i'm uh allergic to
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	so you had mentioned ( um ) going to treatment recently
counselor.quc	has there been any other times that you've tried to quit ( um ) either drinking or using crack
-	-
client.r+3	yeah ( just ) just being in a building when i tried to quit i told them ( i t* ) they called me right and i said don't [du] want me to get you some don't call me and i said and if you want me to smoke don't call me or knock on my door because i'm trying to quit and they didn't
client.r-3	( you know ) but then one day ( they's in the hall and um ) i see them in the hall and ( uh ) they said want a hit i said yeah
-	-
client.fn	( you know i ) i quit for about four days yeah
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.su	and so it sounds ( um ) i could see how that could be tricky of
counselor.rec	( um ) you were saying that ( it's ) you can't necessarily pinpoint what you enjoy about it but that one of the main things is that when you do it you want more ( um ) and then you're also in this place where there's just constantly people that make it really available
client.fn	yeah
client.r-3	going through yeah
client.r-3	exactly
-	-
client.fn	alcohol is not a bad problem there [du] drugs
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) because ( i ) my neighbor ( she ) maybe she'll drink two three cans of beer that's about it
client.fn	but i don't know if she does any drugs or not she don't bother me she'll bother me for a cigarette
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.r+3	and that's another thing too when i don't drink and i don't smoke crack i don't smoke cigarettes but when i start that in i do everything it's weird
-	-
counselor.res	so again it just sort of almost has the flood gates and things kind of start doing other things a little bit more
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
client.r+3	( and then and then i forget )
client.r+3	about [du] i forget about my book and i forget about my book i'm rea* book i've been reading for about two weeks now [du] very far
client.r+3	and ( um ) i just forget about things i'm supposed to do i just let everything go
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	( and ) and ( my financial ) it's affecting my financial i got my cable cut off because i bought crack and ( i i got ) i paid my rent but buying crack [du] now i don't got no cable or my phone ( you know ) because i spent most of my money on it
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.res	mm-hmm so ( you ) it's got you to kind of lose interest in certain things that you were once interested in and also causes some financial issues as well
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.r+3	exactly because i had the money twice to pay my bill right and i tell myself no i'm not gonna get no crack first thing i do is go buy crack
-	-
counselor.res	but it sounds like also what you were saying was ( um ) when you have appointments that sort of helps you a little bit in terms of ( um ) maybe not using right before the appointment or
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	what i need to do is just ( um ) bring my bill to my payee because she just gives me the money and i don't pay it i need her to make the check out to the people that's what i need to tell her
counselor.res	things like that
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	( uh where's your ) is your payee through madison as well or
client.fn	no huh-uh
counselor.res	it's different
client.fn	no totally different
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	yeah because ( uh she ) i know if she [du] missing my bills she'd say you haven't been paying your bill and then ( she'll ) she's smart she'll say okay she'll just make the check out there to the broadstripe
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and they keep charging me i [du] they gave me a bill for this month for eighty_nine dollars [du] ( my ) my cable has been off since september the first of september and ( they're still ) they're still ( charging me ) billing me for ten_six this month
counselor.fa	mm
counselor.fa	oh
counselor.fa	huh
-	-
client.fn	( my ) my phone has been off and my cable has been off
counselor.su	that's strange
client.fn	[du] my bill is three_hundred_and_seven dollars now ( i haven't even ) it hasn't even been on
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	mm-hmm but i know where the office is i'm gonna go talk to them [du]
client.fn	and ( that's the only ) that's the only cable you can hook up with that building is broadstripe
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and i'm not the only one who's getting big high bills my friend mike he's only been in not even a month he got a three_hundred dollar bill from broadstripe
counselor.fa	oh wow
-	-
counselor.quc	for just a month
-	-
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.su	hmm [laugh] that seems kind of ridiculous
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.quc	so ( um ) how do you feel about ( like ) the do you feel like you have a pretty good support system here like friends and family
-	-
client.fn	i got no i don't have no family in washington all my family is all in montana
client.r-3	( friend ) friend-wise all my friends do drugs
counselor.fa	mm
client.r+3	well not all of mine i got some friend that cleaned up ( you know ) and ( um ) i could probably i know well two of them are pretty supportive
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+n3	well i really think i need to get back into treatment i get into treatment and get out of that building
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.quc	did you feel like treatment was pretty helpful for you
-	-
client.fn	this last time i was in there yeah
client.r-3	see because when i go to treatment [du] put me right in that building i lived up capitol_hill it's like i said it's the environment
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and when i on capitol_hill i smoked maybe once that was it
client.fn	and ( um ) then i moved out of there because the rent was too high four_hundred_and_twenty_five a month
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
client.fn	i wasn't getting my check [du] ( si* ) six_hundred dollars and that's when my case manager put me in the_lions
client.fn	and she knew what it was about mm-hmm she knew what was going on in that building she knows i'm a ( addict you know drug addict ) alcohol and drug addict but so
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.rec	so seems like ( uh ) treatment you felt like was pretty effective and then before you were living in an area where the temptation may just not have been as present but a lot of it just seems centered around the fact that you're in the neighborhood that you're in right now
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.r-3	[du] it around me yeah
-	-
client.ts+3	so i was talking to ( my ) my c_c_s worker about going in treatment
client.c+3	i think i'm gonna try ninety day program
-	-
counselor.quc	okay did you have some programs in mind [du]
client.o+3	yeah i
client.o+3	i'd go to thunderbird
-	-
counselor.fa	oh okay
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	is that where you went for treatment before
client.fn	yeah
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
client.fn	alright i talked to anthony about it right now ( it's um ) there's no beds available he said people waiting to get in it
client.fn	but ( me la* ) i was in treatment nineteen_seventy_six that was for alcohol and i have never been in treatment since ( um ) this year
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	okay
client.fn	that's a long time nineteen_seventy_six to two_thousand_ten that's a big old thing
-	-
client.fn	but i see a lot of people that ( go in there ) go in there thirty days they come out and they get drunk ( you know ) go back in for another thirty days
client.fn	and i said that's just a rest stop place for you guys
-	-
counselor.quo	so what were some of the things that you liked about treatment
-	-
client.fn	i liked to ta* i talked about my problem ( you know ) we had group meetings talk about my problem
client.fn	and ( i i made a ) i made dream catchers in there
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	( you know ) and ( i ) i found out i'm not the only one who's good at ( um ) i always think well i must really have bad ( um ) alcohol and drug problem i'm not the only one ( you know )
-	-
client.fn	i hear people's horror stories ( you know ) and [du] some pretty bad stories
-	-
counselor.rec	so having that community having other people that have kind of shared similar experiences was helpful in feeling like maybe you weren't as alone in what you had gone through as well and the chance to do cool things like make dream catchers too
client.fn	mm yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i met different people yeah
client.fn	see ( i ) i got beads sitting up in my house [du] right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o+3	and [du] i need to start getting into [du] program ( s* ) a women's group it's at the y
client.o+3	[du] ( i got a ) they sent me a calendar [du] every thursdays and they have different things going every day that's why i need to get involved and get out of that building ( you know ) during the daytime
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	i don't know if it make any difference at night but i'm sure it will
-	-
counselor.rec	so keeping yourself busy kinda out of the building maybe sort of connecting with other people ( um ) who may not be using as much you think would make more of a difference
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	yeah
client.o+3	[du] yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.quc	so on a scale of zero to ten zero being not at all and ten being extremely ( um ) how important would you say it is for you right now to change ( um ) your drug use
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.o+3	well a ten i'd say it's very important for me to change my drug
counselor.fa	okay
client.r+3	because ( of my i'm ) i'm on this medication too
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	( a* ) and it's not healthy either
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm and so one of your primary concerns also is ( you know ) what does it mean in terms of if you're starting to take your h_i_v meds and then also using as well
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quo	( um ) and so ( how would you see ) what kind of change do you think you could see in terms of your drug use
-	-
client.fn	me ( uh in ) what kind of change
client.fn	what do you mean what way what kind of change ( like ) me not taking drugs
-	-
counselor.gi	oh yeah i guess ( um ) so to put it a different way there's ( um s* ) just so many different options that people sometimes have
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.gi	( um ) so for some people there's ( you know ) no change ( um ) kinda continue to use
counselor.gi	( um ) for some people it's cutting down on their use a little bit
client.fn	i think cutting down would be me yeah cutting down
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.res	so not necessarily stopping cold turkey but just sort of
-	-
counselor.res	cutting down more
client.r+a3	oh ( i ) i can stop cold turkey
client.r+3	because i don't get sick on it ( i ) crack don't make me sick i don't get ( like uh um ) [du] get hangover from alcohol but crack don't affect me i don't get sick from it
counselor.fa	okay
counselor.fa	oh okay
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so when you've ( um ) completely stopped before ( um ) you don't feel any kinda sickness or any kind of craving or anything like that okay
client.fn	mm
client.fn	huh-uh
client.fn	no
client.fn	no
-	-
client.r-3	there's a craving there there always be a craving
client.r+3	but i don't get sick
-	-
counselor.fa	okay
-	-
counselor.quc	and so if you had to choose right now ( um ) do you feel like then you would want to sort of quit completely or cut down or sort of just ( um )
-	-
client.c+3	quit completely
-	-
counselor.res	that's kind of the point that you're at right now
client.fn	yeah
client.o+3	yeah ( a* ) and ( you know ) the only thing ( i could ) i could think of help me quitting the drug and stuff is ( going ) moving back home because they don't have that stuff back home
-	-
counselor.quc	mm where is back home
client.fn	montana
-	-
client.r+3	on my reservation they don't
client.fn	they got drugs back there but ( they ) i'm not a pill popper and all that ( you know )
client.r+3	yeah because when i went home last year for four months ( you know i didn't ) i didn't miss it i didn't miss it because i knew it wasn't there and i couldn't have it it didn't bother me
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.c+3	and ( if ) if i have to move home to get off this drug and ( get back ) get healthy on this medication that's what i'm gonna do yeah
counselor.fa	mm
-	-
counselor.quc	and so how ( um ) possible is it for you to move home right now
-	-
client.fn	i can move home any time
-	-
counselor.rec	okay so it's something that you're kind of keeping in the back of your mind
client.o+3	thinking about yeah
-	-
client.fn	uh-huh because i have a home back home i got my own home back there
counselor.fa	mm
client.fn	but i choose the city life
counselor.nc	[laugh]
client.fn	yeah there's all my family there my son [du] over there
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.res	so it seems like you're considering some things of looking into maybe getting back into thunderbird again ( um ) looking to get out of ( the place ) the environment that you're living in
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	mm
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.res	( um ) you had mentioned maybe looking into ( um ) programs at the y_w_c_a i think you said
client.fn	yeah it's called babes babes
counselor.res	babes okay
client.fn	mm-hmm it's ( uh ) women with h_i_v and aids [du] h_i_v
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	and they have a lot of things to do like they go on camping trips and retreats and all that
counselor.af	oh cool
client.fn	( i ) i've never been there i get the newsletter but they probably think i don't exist because they never even met me
-	-
counselor.rec	and you had said also that you have ( some friends ) some friends that you feel like they do use so that might be a little tricky
client.fn	no
client.fn	they don't use
-	-
counselor.res	but ( you ) you have some friends that also don't use
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	right
client.fn	mm-hmm
-	-
client.fn	[du] are we almost done
-	-
counselor.quc	hmm
-	-
client.fn	are we almost done
-	-
counselor.gi	yup we are actually
counselor.quc	( um ) so did you have any questions for me at all or
-	-
client.fn	no
-	-
counselor.gi	okay well that's pretty much it just kind of a check-in conversation sort of ( you know ) [du]
client.fn	so yeah i have a que*
-	-
client.fn	( where do you see ) where do you see me at on this drug problem
counselor.fa	hmm
-	-
counselor.af	oh that's a good question
counselor.gi	( you know ) honestly i don't really know i mean i don't have a certain viewpoint on it
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.ec	it sounds to me like you have a lot of options available to you
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.res	from what you had said ( um ) it's really important ( you know ) putting it on a ten it's really important for you ( um ) to quit and cut down
client.fn	mm
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.rec	( um ) and it sounds like ( you have ) you've been thinking a lot about different ways to be able to do that
client.fn	yeah
counselor.af	which is great
counselor.rec	i mean i think you recognize ( um ) the things that have helped you in the past so having support ( um )
counselor.rec	and you've been
client.r+3	and how it's how it's getting me financial-wise
-	-
counselor.res	yeah but ( you know ) having the community ( um ) being around people who you feel like are supportive of you and maybe have gone through similar things sounds like that's has been very helpful to you
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	mm
counselor.res	( um ) and then ( you know ) having those options of treatment or ( you know ) getting involved in more activities out at the y_w_c_a
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.res	and even knowing that ( having uh ) going back home is an option as well
client.fn	mm-hmm
counselor.ec	it sounds like you have a lot of choices available to you
client.fn	yeah
counselor.rec	so and you sound ( you know ) very motivated about wanting to change
client.fn	okay
-	-
client.o+3	mm-hmm i am
client.r+d3	maybe i wanna get off that stuff
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+3	because like i said i don't drink until i smoke then i want the alcohol then i want the cigarette
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
counselor.rec	mm-hmm and what you had said too is the biggest concern right now seems to also be related to the meds that you're starting to take as well ( um ) and not having any negative health effects from using
client.fn	yeah
client.fn	mm-hmm
client.fn	yeah
counselor.quc	so well would it be okay with you
counselor.nc	i'll go ahead and let it stop
-	-
counselor.nc	all right now it's starting
counselor.af	so thanks for i know you answered a lot of questions with jessica and for too participating on this study we really appreciate that
counselor.st	( um ) today we're just gonna have a little conversation about use of substances
counselor.gi	i'm not here to tell you what to do or what you should be doing or what you need to change but just wanna kinda chat a little about that if that's all right
client.fn	yeah
-	-
counselor.gi	( um ) so one of ( the ) the ( um ) questionnaires that you did is called the ( drug_assessment ) drug_assessment i forgot what the s stands for screening_test
counselor.gi	and it kinda helps assess people's risk for their use of substances
counselor.gi	and they rate it on a scale of zero to ten with ten being really high risk ( you know )
-	-
counselor.quc	where do you think you might ( um ) rate
-	-
client.o-2	neither because reefer don't make you
-	-
counselor.quc	reefer doesn't what
client.fn	yeah
-	-
client.o-2	( um er ) marijuana don't make you uptight or anything
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-2	all it does is ( settle you ) settle you down and put you to sleep or give you appetite to eat that's it
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-2	i've been smoking weed for over fifteen years and it does nothing to make me angry yell down or anything
client.o-2	i don't do drugs like that drugs that mess with your brain cells turn you down like mescaline and crack and all those other junky these fools taking
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
-	-
client.r+7	and then when you do that you turn around and drink liquor you got two kind of ugly substance going into your brain
counselor.fa	right
client.fn	and that's what make people today violent and do what they do
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.o-2	but ( r* ) weed nah
-	-
counselor.rec	( it doesn't ) it doesn't do anything
client.o-2	don't do
-	-
client.o-2	nothing
client.o-2	it just make you feel hungry or sleepy
client.r+2	or lazy ( you know ) you don't want to go nowhere
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.fn	because it depends on what kind of weed you got
client.r-2	some good weed [cough] it perk you up

-	-
client.r-2	yes i its cheaper to get
client.r+8	other stuff's is shoot hm-mm high costs a whole lot
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
client.r+8	and then you gotta have once you start it you gotta have some money in your pocket to get some more
-	-
counselor.rec	keep going huh
-	-
client.r+8	and when you on disability that's not [du] doing the other kind of drug you can't afford ( to ) to get every day
counselor.fa	right
counselor.fa	mm-hmm
