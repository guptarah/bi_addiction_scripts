 i understand that i_understand understand_that that_. 
 so chris i want to come back to this point you raised a while ago so_chris chris_i i_want want_to to_come come_back back_to to_this this_point point_you you_raised raised_a a_while while_ago ago_. 
   
   
   
 and i &apos;m wondering if approaching this not an all or nothing and_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_wondering wondering_if if_approaching approaching_this this_not not_an an_all all_or or_nothing nothing_. 
 if you can think about is there a way that you can modify change maybe stop i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s something you &apos;re interested in the alcohol if_you you_can can_think think_about about_is is_there there_a a_way way_that that_you you_can can_modify modify_change change_maybe maybe_stop stop_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_if if_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_interested interested_in in_the the_alcohol alcohol_. 
 so let &apos;s key in on that so_let let_&apos;s &apos;s_key key_in in_on on_that that_. 
 i know sometimes things seem like they just occur and all of a sudden we &apos;re doing something and we don &apos;t know how we got there i_know know_sometimes sometimes_things things_seem seem_like like_they they_just just_occur occur_and and_all all_of of_a a_sudden sudden_we we_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_something something_and and_we we_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_how how_we we_got got_there there_. 
 and so if it &apos;s like well maybe i &apos;ll just go get a fifth it &apos;s being able to kind of recognize that that thought comes up and being able to say okay let me think through do i really want to do that what am i going to get from it what &apos;s it going to cost me and_so so_if if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_well well_maybe maybe_i i_&apos;ll &apos;ll_just just_go go_get get_a a_fifth fifth_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_being being_able able_to to_kind kind_of of_recognize recognize_that that_that that_thought thought_comes comes_up up_and and_being being_able able_to to_say say_okay okay_let let_me me_think think_through through_do do_i i_really really_want want_to to_do do_that that_what what_am am_i i_going going_to to_get get_from from_it it_what what_&apos;s &apos;s_it it_going going_to to_cost cost_me me_.

 that &apos;s that_&apos;s &apos;s_. 
 a really big change a_really really_big big_change change_. 
   
 wow wow_. 
 that &apos;s a really big change to make that_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_really really_big big_change change_to to_make make_. 
 sorry that must have been hard sorry_that that_must must_have have_been been_hard hard_. 
   
   
   
   
   
 alcohol &apos;s legal alcohol_&apos;s &apos;s_legal legal_. 
   
   
   
   
 i do that too i_do do_that that_too too_. 
 i could see that being a difficult choice to make if that &apos;s those are your people the people you &apos;re around all the time i_could could_see see_that that_being being_a a_difficult difficult_choice choice_to to_make make_if if_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_those those_are are_your your_people people_the the_people people_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_around around_all all_the the_time time_. 
   
   
   
 yeah let me pause it yeah_let let_me me_pause pause_it it_. 
 but if it &apos;s something you &apos;re concerned about i &apos;m wondering if it might be worth bringing up with your primary care provider but_if if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_concerned concerned_about about_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_wondering wondering_if if_it it_might might_be be_worth worth_bringing bringing_up up_with with_your your_primary primary_care care_provider provider_. 
   
   
 you &apos;ve been through so much you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_through through_so so_much much_. 
 yeah it sounds like if it &apos;s a change you wanna make you have the willpower to do it the you &apos;ve done it for crack yeah_it it_sounds sounds_like like_if if_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_change change_you you_wanna wanna_make make_you you_have have_the the_willpower willpower_to to_do do_it it_the the_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_done done_it it_for for_crack crack_. 
 so if and when you decide you &apos;re really ready it seems like you definitely have this the willpower and your faith and strength to make those make changes so_if if_and and_when when_you you_decide decide_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_really really_ready ready_it it_seems seems_like like_you you_definitely definitely_have have_this this_the the_willpower willpower_and and_your your_faith faith_and and_strength strength_to to_make make_those those_make make_changes changes_. 
 but it might be worth exploring with him just in case but_it it_might might_be be_worth worth_exploring exploring_with with_him him_just just_in in_case case_. 
 and it &apos;s totally your call and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_totally totally_your your_call call_. 
 so one option is to not make any changes and just keep using the same way that you have been so_one one_option option_is is_to to_not not_make make_any any_changes changes_and and_just just_keep keep_using using_the the_same same_way way_that that_you you_have have_been been_. 
 another option would be to cut back use a little less than you usually do or use in situations that might be safer for you like maybe not when you &apos;re working but on the weekends only or another_option option_would would_be be_to to_cut cut_back back_use use_a a_little little_less less_than than_you you_usually usually_do do_or or_use use_in in_situations situations_that that_might might_be be_safer safer_for for_you you_like like_maybe maybe_not not_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_working working_but but_on on_the the_weekends weekends_only only_or or_. 
 another option would be to seek treatment another_option option_would would_be be_to to_seek seek_treatment treatment_. 
 keep using not doing anything oh quit completely just cold turkey stop entirely cut back seek treatment keep_using using_not not_doing doing_anything anything_oh oh_quit quit_completely completely_just just_cold cold_turkey turkey_stop stop_entirely entirely_cut cut_back back_seek seek_treatment treatment_.
