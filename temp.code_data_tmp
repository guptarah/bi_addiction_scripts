 and so in so you &apos;re using marijuana for sleep pain anxiety and_so so_in in_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_marijuana marijuana_for for_sleep sleep_pain pain_anxiety anxiety_. 
 i see so it really helps so if you &apos;re not using it you &apos;re thinking the pain is more prevalent or you &apos;re focused more on the pain i_see see_so so_it it_really really_helps helps_so so_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_using using_it it_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_the the_pain pain_is is_more more_prevalent prevalent_or or_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_focused focused_more more_on on_the the_pain pain_. 
 it drags the day out okay it_drags drags_the the_day day_out out_okay okay_. 
 okay and so this helps you so that you can focus on other things okay_and and_so so_this this_helps helps_you you_so so_that that_you you_can can_focus focus_on on_other other_things things_. 
 as a baker as_a a_baker baker_. 
 interacting mingling and stuff like that interacting_mingling mingling_and and_stuff stuff_like like_that that_. 
 okay and if you didn &apos;t have marijuana you &apos;d be too edgy to okay_and and_if if_you you_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_marijuana marijuana_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_too too_edgy edgy_to to_. 
 yeah you &apos;d be a little more irritable you &apos;d be like withdrawn or something yeah_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_a a_little little_more more_irritable irritable_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_like like_withdrawn withdrawn_or or_something something_. 
 and you &apos;re probably the kinda guy that if you &apos;re feeling that way because you &apos;re a social guy that you kinda turn away from people and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_probably probably_the the_kinda kinda_guy guy_that that_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_that that_way way_because because_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_a a_social social_guy guy_that that_you you_kinda kinda_turn turn_away away_from from_people people_. 
 they notice yeah they_notice notice_yeah yeah_. 
 and almost it sounds like in a sense you wouldn &apos;t wanna you &apos;d feel like you were burdening them if you were telling them about all your pain and stuff so and_almost almost_it it_sounds sounds_like like_in in_a a_sense sense_you you_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_wanna wanna_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_feel feel_like like_you you_were were_burdening burdening_them them_if if_you you_were were_telling telling_them them_about about_all all_your your_pain pain_and and_stuff stuff_so so_. 
 oh okay so you can &apos;t really talk about it oh_okay okay_so so_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_talk talk_about about_it it_. 
 you don &apos;t have an outlet for talking about your tendency you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_an an_outlet outlet_for for_talking talking_about about_your your_tendency tendency_. 
 so smoking in a way helps you maintain that having to keep it all to yourself so_smoking smoking_in in_a a_way way_helps helps_you you_maintain maintain_that that_having having_to to_keep keep_it it_all all_to to_yourself yourself_. 
 you feel like you would drink more if you weren &apos;t smoking you_feel feel_like like_you you_would would_drink drink_more more_if if_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_smoking smoking_. 
 like you said before i think you said something like numb yourself out or especially at night but during the day when you &apos;re working just to keep the edge off so you can interact with people like_you you_said said_before before_i i_think think_you you_said said_something something_like like_numb numb_yourself yourself_out out_or or_especially especially_at at_night night_but but_during during_the the_day day_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_working working_just just_to to_keep keep_the the_edge edge_off off_so so_you you_can can_interact interact_with with_people people_. 
 but the but_the the_. 
 the okay so no drinking at work the_okay okay_so so_no no_drinking drinking_at at_work work_. 
 but that &apos;s what the marijuana &apos;s for but_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_the the_marijuana marijuana_&apos;s &apos;s_for for_. 
 and if you weren &apos;t using marijuana you &apos;d be using alcohol to achieve the same effects at least at night and_if if_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_using using_marijuana marijuana_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_using using_alcohol alcohol_to to_achieve achieve_the the_same same_effects effects_at at_least least_at at_night night_. 
 don &apos;t want it to be a finger don_&apos;t &apos;t_want want_it it_to to_be be_a a_finger finger_. 
 so the difference between using alcohol at work and marijuana at work there &apos;s so_the the_difference difference_between between_using using_alcohol alcohol_at at_work work_and and_marijuana marijuana_at at_work work_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_. 
 you wouldn &apos;t cut your finger off with marijuana you_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_cut cut_your your_finger finger_off off_with with_marijuana marijuana_. 
 and that &apos;s you experience a lot of pain experience some problems with your stomach both because of anxiety and because of medication you &apos;re taking and also being at work being edgy at work and stuff like that and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_you you_experience experience_a a_lot lot_of of_pain pain_experience experience_some some_problems problems_with with_your your_stomach stomach_both both_because because_of of_anxiety anxiety_and and_because because_of of_medication medication_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_taking taking_and and_also also_being being_at at_work work_being being_edgy edgy_at at_work work_and and_stuff stuff_like like_that that_. 
 high stress high_stress stress_. 
 right and so smoking marijuana in a sense helps you with all that stuff it helps you sleep it helps your stomach helps you it takes off the edge at work also so that you don &apos;t have to right_and and_so so_smoking smoking_marijuana marijuana_in in_a a_sense sense_helps helps_you you_with with_all all_that that_stuff stuff_it it_helps helps_you you_sleep sleep_it it_helps helps_your your_stomach stomach_helps helps_you you_it it_takes takes_off off_the the_edge edge_at at_work work_also also_so so_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_to to_. 
 it helps you focus that &apos;s right you said that it_helps helps_you you_focus focus_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_right right_you you_said said_that that_. 
 it helps you focus it_helps helps_you you_focus focus_. 
 and so there wouldn &apos;t be a way to do that with the pain that you have or and_so so_there there_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_be be_a a_way way_to to_do do_that that_with with_the the_pain pain_that that_you you_have have_or or_. 
 mm-hmm so it really helps you be able to do things that you wouldn &apos;t be able to do otherwise mm-hmm mm-hmm_so so_it it_really really_helps helps_you you_be be_able able_to to_do do_things things_that that_you you_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_be be_able able_to to_do do_otherwise otherwise_mm-hmm mm-hmm_. 
 yeah so i mean it sounds like it really adds to your life in a way that it makes things a lot more manageable yeah_so so_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_really really_adds adds_to to_your your_life life_in in_a a_way way_that that_it it_makes makes_things things_a a_lot lot_more more_manageable manageable_. 
 so i mean it sounds like there &apos;s just quite a bit of positives there so_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_quite quite_a a_bit bit_of of_positives positives_there there_. 
 baking it into kinda baking_it it_into into_kinda kinda_. 
 oh for the medical marijuana oh_for for_the the_medical medical_marijuana marijuana_. 
 oh okay wow so you might start jumping into that so it sounds like that seems maybe a little bit better or different than oh_okay okay_wow wow_so so_you you_might might_start start_jumping jumping_into into_that that_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_that that_seems seems_maybe maybe_a a_little little_bit bit_better better_or or_different different_than than_. 
 yeah so if i &apos;m hearing you right then there &apos;s something about not using it so recreationally and also trying to watch out for your health and stuff like that too yeah_so so_if if_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_you you_right right_then then_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_about about_not not_using using_it it_so so_recreationally recreationally_and and_also also_trying trying_to to_watch watch_out out_for for_your your_health health_and and_stuff stuff_like like_that that_too too_. 
 huh so you used to get in trouble huh_so so_you you_used used_to to_get get_in in_trouble trouble_. 
 but you were saying that you were but_you you_were were_saying saying_that that_you you_were were_. 
 so there was something different between then and now where you were getting in trouble where you weren &apos;t able to keep it at one place so_there there_was was_something something_different different_between between_then then_and and_now now_where where_you you_were were_getting getting_in in_trouble trouble_where where_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_able able_to to_keep keep_it it_at at_one one_place place_. 
 mm-hmm there &apos;s almost something maybe kind of rebellious about it before but you it almost seems like you look somehow that wouldn &apos;t fit into your life now that mm-hmm_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_almost almost_something something_maybe maybe_kind kind_of of_rebellious rebellious_about about_it it_before before_but but_you you_it it_almost almost_seems seems_like like_you you_look look_somehow somehow_that that_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_fit fit_into into_your your_life life_now now_that that_. 
 mm-hmm and you also said before you didn &apos;t have a place for it or mm-hmm_and and_you you_also also_said said_before before_you you_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_have have_a a_place place_for for_it it_or or_. 
 you can keep it at your house now you were moving it around a lot before you_can can_keep keep_it it_at at_your your_house house_now now_you you_were were_moving moving_it it_around around_a a_lot lot_before before_. 
 okay so you &apos;ve there &apos;s something about being more stable too that and it sounds like in this relationship where you &apos;re feeling like i &apos;m kinda being the you &apos;re being very aware of what you &apos;re doing and how you &apos;re using okay_so so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_about about_being being_more more_stable stable_too too_that that_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_in in_this this_relationship relationship_where where_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_feeling feeling_like like_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_kinda kinda_being being_the the_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_being being_very very_aware aware_of of_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_and and_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_. 
 and it seems like that you are interested in maintaining that and that and_it it_seems seems_like like_that that_you you_are are_interested interested_in in_maintaining maintaining_that that_and and_that that_. 
 that &apos;s that_&apos;s &apos;s_. 
 i mean it sound i can kinda just hear how even with the use of marijuana that because of the way that your life has changed now you value now that you &apos;ve changed your way of using it and kinda viewing it i_mean mean_it it_sound sound_i i_can can_kinda kinda_just just_hear hear_how how_even even_with with_the the_use use_of of_marijuana marijuana_that that_because because_of of_the the_way way_that that_your your_life life_has has_changed changed_now now_you you_value value_now now_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_changed changed_your your_way way_of of_using using_it it_and and_kinda kinda_viewing viewing_it it_. 
 and you were saying before that you &apos;d wake up with a burned out pipes and stuff gone and_you you_were were_saying saying_before before_that that_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_wake wake_up up_with with_a a_burned burned_out out_pipes pipes_and and_stuff stuff_gone gone_. 
 so you &apos;re losing interest in alcohol so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_losing losing_interest interest_in in_alcohol alcohol_. 
 and does that relate to the marijuana and_does does_that that_relate relate_to to_the the_marijuana marijuana_. 
 it sounds like a really good situation it_sounds sounds_like like_a a_really really_good good_situation situation_. 
 it sounds like you &apos;re really happy with that it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_really really_happy happy_with with_that that_. 
 so this a whole new experience so_this this_a a_whole whole_new new_experience experience_. 
 so it &apos;s like a load off really so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_a a_load load_off off_really really_. 
 yeah i mean it sounds like coming out here yeah_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_coming coming_out out_here here_. 
 this it sounds like it &apos;s made a huge impact on you and it sounds like there &apos;s big differences and there &apos;s been a lot of things affecting how you view for one drinking and then two the way you use marijuana you &apos;ve used it for a long time but you &apos;re using it really kinda more of a mindful manner using it for there &apos;s a purpose to it this_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_made made_a a_huge huge_impact impact_on on_you you_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_big big_differences differences_and and_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_a a_lot lot_of of_things things_affecting affecting_how how_you you_view view_for for_one one_drinking drinking_and and_then then_two two_the the_way way_you you_use use_marijuana marijuana_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_used used_it it_for for_a a_long long_time time_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_it it_really really_kinda kinda_more more_of of_a a_mindful mindful_manner manner_using using_it it_for for_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_purpose purpose_to to_it it_. 
 in i mean it sounds like you &apos;ve got a pretty good routine with it in_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_pretty pretty_good good_routine routine_with with_it it_. 
 yeah so so it doesn &apos;t really interfere with activities but it does cost a lot of money yeah_so so_so so_it it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_interfere interfere_with with_activities activities_but but_it it_does does_cost cost_a a_lot lot_of of_money money_. 
 you find yourself spending more you_find find_yourself yourself_spending spending_more more_. 
 it &apos;s better it_&apos;s &apos;s_better better_. 
 so it &apos;s just so you know it &apos;s gonna be safer and it &apos;s safer and it &apos;s cheaper so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_so so_you you_know know_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_gonna gonna_be be_safer safer_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_safer safer_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_cheaper cheaper_. 
 keep you buying keep_you you_buying buying_. 
 and the distributors you &apos;ve looked into it they don &apos;t do that and_the the_distributors distributors_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_looked looked_into into_it it_they they_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_that that_. 
 yeah so you have been very mindful about that yeah_so so_you you_have have_been been_very very_mindful mindful_about about_that that_. 
 right so it &apos;s really about if you could fit it in or not how it fits into the budget it &apos;s not like you &apos;re saying like oh i need marijuana i &apos;m gonna go out and buy a bunch right_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_really really_about about_if if_you you_could could_fit fit_it it_in in_or or_not not_how how_it it_fits fits_into into_the the_budget budget_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_saying saying_like like_oh oh_i i_need need_marijuana marijuana_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_gonna gonna_go go_out out_and and_buy buy_a a_bunch bunch_. 
 you &apos;re you_&apos;re &apos;re_. 
 so you &apos;re not it &apos;s not coming straight out of your budget you &apos;re doing a little something extra to get the extra money to get it so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_coming coming_straight straight_out out_of of_your your_budget budget_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_a a_little little_something something_extra extra_to to_get get_the the_extra extra_money money_to to_get get_it it_. 
 mm-hmm so make sure you &apos;re using it in a controlled manner mm-hmm_so so_make make_sure sure_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_it it_in in_a a_controlled controlled_manner manner_. 
 and it seems like you &apos;ve been really mindful about it and_it it_seems seems_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_really really_mindful mindful_about about_it it_. 
 right so it sounds like waiting for how that medication &apos;s going to affect you and so based on that you don &apos;t know if you might use a little more or need to use a little less of something less so you have to stay kinda open to that right_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_waiting waiting_for for_how how_that that_medication medication_&apos;s &apos;s_going going_to to_affect affect_you you_and and_so so_based based_on on_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_if if_you you_might might_use use_a a_little little_more more_or or_need need_to to_use use_a a_little little_less less_of of_something something_less less_so so_you you_have have_to to_stay stay_kinda kinda_open open_to to_that that_. 
 but it sounds like overall you &apos;ve been pretty mindful and you wanna make sure that you stay mindful about how you &apos;re using it and using it in a controlled manner but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_overall overall_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_pretty pretty_mindful mindful_and and_you you_wanna wanna_make make_sure sure_that that_you you_stay stay_mindful mindful_about about_how how_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_using using_it it_and and_using using_it it_in in_a a_controlled controlled_manner manner_. 
 maybe different than you anticipated maybe_different different_than than_you you_anticipated anticipated_. 
 didn &apos;t know what to expect didn_&apos;t &apos;t_know know_what what_to to_expect expect_. 
 so you like the high but it increases your heart rate and it costs too much so_you you_like like_the the_high high_but but_it it_increases increases_your your_heart heart_rate rate_and and_it it_costs costs_too too_much much_. 
 and it sounds also like it makes you just you feel guilty and_it it_sounds sounds_also also_like like_it it_makes makes_you you_just just_you you_feel feel_guilty guilty_. 
 it makes you feel badly because you feel guilty it_makes makes_you you_feel feel_badly badly_because because_you you_feel feel_guilty guilty_. 
 so when you alcohol it sounds like maybe impacts or affects your thinking so that you &apos;re maybe not as clear about the consequences or the things that you don &apos;t like about it when you &apos;re drinking so_when when_you you_alcohol alcohol_it it_sounds sounds_like like_maybe maybe_impacts impacts_or or_affects affects_your your_thinking thinking_so so_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_maybe maybe_not not_as as_clear clear_about about_the the_consequences consequences_or or_the the_things things_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_about about_it it_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_drinking drinking_. 
 so you got a lot of reasons excuse me to not use crack because well it sounds like you don &apos;t like the way it makes you feel physically spending too much money it &apos;s illegal it &apos;s bad for you you it causes health problems so you had all those things that you don &apos;t like about it so_you you_got got_a a_lot lot_of of_reasons reasons_excuse excuse_me me_to to_not not_use use_crack crack_because because_well well_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_the the_way way_it it_makes makes_you you_feel feel_physically physically_spending spending_too too_much much_money money_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_illegal illegal_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_bad bad_for for_you you_you you_it it_causes causes_health health_problems problems_so so_you you_had had_all all_those those_things things_that that_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_about about_it it_. 
 but on the other hand when you &apos;re drinking maybe you &apos;re not thinking those things but_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_drinking drinking_maybe maybe_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_thinking thinking_those those_things things_. 
 oh so if you weren &apos;t drinking but yet you had it was all around you you had those same people offering it to you you &apos;re able to say oh_so so_if if_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_drinking drinking_but but_yet yet_you you_had had_it it_was was_all all_around around_you you_you you_had had_those those_same same_people people_offering offering_it it_to to_you you_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_able able_to to_say say_. 
 so you &apos;re more agreeable to doing anything suggestible when you &apos;re drinking so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_more more_agreeable agreeable_to to_doing doing_anything anything_suggestible suggestible_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_drinking drinking_. 
 but when you &apos;re not drinking you think more clearly you think about your health and you &apos;re being more responsible but when you &apos;re drinking those things seem to disappear but_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_drinking drinking_you you_think think_more more_clearly clearly_you you_think think_about about_your your_health health_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_being being_more more_responsible responsible_but but_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_drinking drinking_those those_things things_seem seem_to to_disappear disappear_. 
 so you &apos;ve got a lot of guilt so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_a a_lot lot_of of_guilt guilt_. 
 yeah and guilt makes you feel bad and about yourself yeah_and and_guilt guilt_makes makes_you you_feel feel_bad bad_and and_about about_yourself yourself_. 
 so you have things that you enjoy doing exercise is one so_you you_have have_things things_that that_you you_enjoy enjoy_doing doing_exercise exercise_is is_one one_. 
 reading reading_. 
 and when you &apos;re doing stuff like that you &apos;re not drinking and_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_stuff stuff_like like_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_drinking drinking_. 
 and then you &apos;re not tempted by these people who are around to use crack and_then then_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_tempted tempted_by by_these these_people people_who who_are are_around around_to to_use use_crack crack_. 
 right and that &apos;s challenging too when you see it when it &apos;s there in your environment and it &apos;s in your mind and it &apos;s always present and it &apos;s a temptation right_and and_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_challenging challenging_too too_when when_you you_see see_it it_when when_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_there there_in in_your your_environment environment_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_in in_your your_mind mind_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_always always_present present_and and_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_temptation temptation_. 
 not far from here not_far far_from from_here here_.

 so just from the little that we &apos;ve talked here it sounds like it &apos;s very important for you to not drink and to not do drugs so_just just_from from_the the_little little_that that_we we_&apos;ve &apos;ve_talked talked_here here_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_very very_important important_for for_you you_to to_not not_drink drink_and and_to to_not not_do do_drugs drugs_.

 and that happened six months ago and_that that_happened happened_six six_months months_ago ago_. 
 the alcohol you turned to alcohol the_alcohol alcohol_you you_turned turned_to to_alcohol alcohol_. 
 you had been drinking but it increased at that time you_had had_been been_drinking drinking_but but_it it_increased increased_at at_that that_time time_. 
 it &apos;s not like it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_like like_. 
 that you need it so bad that it &apos;s a knot in your stomach that_you you_need need_it it_so so_bad bad_that that_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_knot knot_in in_your your_stomach stomach_. 
 you say the marijuana &apos;s different from the alcohol you_say say_the the_marijuana marijuana_&apos;s &apos;s_different different_from from_the the_alcohol alcohol_. 
 because you do marijuana daily also it looks like because_you you_do do_marijuana marijuana_daily daily_also also_it it_looks looks_like like_. 
 you wouldn &apos;t even bother with it you_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_even even_bother bother_with with_it it_. 
 you smoke weed you_smoke smoke_weed weed_. 
 and it turns out being daily pretty much and_it it_turns turns_out out_being being_daily daily_pretty pretty_much much_. 
 so you what i &apos;m hearing is you drink for yourself and you smoke because she &apos;s with you so_you you_what what_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_hearing hearing_is is_you you_drink drink_for for_yourself yourself_and and_you you_smoke smoke_because because_she she_&apos;s &apos;s_with with_you you_. 
 and you could more easily eliminate the marijuana than the alcohol and_you you_could could_more more_easily easily_eliminate eliminate_the the_marijuana marijuana_than than_the the_alcohol alcohol_. 
 so you don &apos;t even really think about it when you smoke with her so_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_even even_really really_think think_about about_it it_when when_you you_smoke smoke_with with_her her_. 
 it &apos;s not as if i shouldn &apos;t be doing this or it &apos;s not as if well on the other hand it &apos;s not if i shouldn &apos;t be doing this you don &apos;t really think about it you just do it right it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_as as_if if_i i_shouldn shouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_be be_doing doing_this this_or or_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_as as_if if_well well_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_if if_i i_shouldn shouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_be be_doing doing_this this_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_think think_about about_it it_you you_just just_do do_it it_right right_.

 but marijuana doesn &apos;t do the same thing for you that alcohol does but_marijuana marijuana_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_do do_the the_same same_thing thing_for for_you you_that that_alcohol alcohol_does does_. 
 and so you &apos;re self limiting just out of physiologically you &apos;re self limiting and_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_self self_limiting limiting_just just_out out_of of_physiologically physiologically_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_self self_limiting limiting_. 
 it &apos;s not as if you have to make the decision i &apos;m done you just kind of nod off it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_as as_if if_you you_have have_to to_make make_the the_decision decision_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_done done_you you_just just_kind kind_of of_nod nod_off off_. 
 you just notice your tolerance is just really high you_just just_notice notice_your your_tolerance tolerance_is is_just just_really really_high high_. 
 so you feel it back there so_you you_feel feel_it it_back back_there there_.

 farm farm_. 
 and when you don &apos;t think about those things when you &apos;re in treatment as and_when when_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_think think_about about_those those_things things_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_treatment treatment_as as_. 
 you kinda have them out there as a goal but it sounds like you haven &apos;t ever sorted out the ways to get to that you_kinda kinda_have have_them them_out out_there there_as as_a a_goal goal_but but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_haven haven_&apos;t &apos;t_ever ever_sorted sorted_out out_the the_ways ways_to to_get get_to to_that that_. 
 so the so_the the_. 
 so when you you don &apos;t it doesn &apos;t sound like you participate in making the goals when you &apos;re in treatment so_when when_you you_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_it it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_sound sound_like like_you you_participate participate_in in_making making_the the_goals goals_when when_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_treatment treatment_. 
 because you kinda said to me that when you came out of treatment there were no there were the other people &apos;s goals and you weren &apos;t happy when you were in treatment so because_you you_kinda kinda_said said_to to_me me_that that_when when_you you_came came_out out_of of_treatment treatment_there there_were were_no no_there there_were were_the the_other other_people people_&apos;s &apos;s_goals goals_and and_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_happy happy_when when_you you_were were_in in_treatment treatment_so so_.

 well i hear you that you &apos;ve really made some major changes in terms of stopping drinking and the only time you use marijuana now you said i &apos;m not addicted i don &apos;t even abuse it i just use it every once in a while to get hungry well_i i_hear hear_you you_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_really really_made made_some some_major major_changes changes_in in_terms terms_of of_stopping stopping_drinking drinking_and and_the the_only only_time time_you you_use use_marijuana marijuana_now now_you you_said said_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_addicted addicted_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_even even_abuse abuse_it it_i i_just just_use use_it it_every every_once once_in in_a a_while while_to to_get get_hungry hungry_. 
 more trouble than more_trouble trouble_than than_. 
 so you talked about the one you talked about how it helps your appetite and gets you to eat more so you don &apos;t lose weight but you also talked about it that it sometimes causes you to binge eat and eat more than your body can process so_you you_talked talked_about about_the the_one one_you you_talked talked_about about_how how_it it_helps helps_your your_appetite appetite_and and_gets gets_you you_to to_eat eat_more more_so so_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_lose lose_weight weight_but but_you you_also also_talked talked_about about_it it_that that_it it_sometimes sometimes_causes causes_you you_to to_binge binge_eat eat_and and_eat eat_more more_than than_your your_body body_can can_process process_. 
 so that has caused you a problem so_that that_has has_caused caused_you you_a a_problem problem_.

 okay so for you its just main concern then is that the problem is still there okay_so so_for for_you you_its its_just just_main main_concern concern_then then_is is_that that_the the_problem problem_is is_still still_there there_. 
 and you said that you guys have started counseling and_you you_said said_that that_you you_guys guys_have have_started started_counseling counseling_. 
 so the beginning stages still so_the the_beginning beginning_stages stages_still still_. 
 kind of like a meet greet kind_of of_like like_a a_meet meet_greet greet_. 
 and so you &apos;re meeting with a counselor to sort of come up with a plan that you and your kids &apos; dad can kind of put together and_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_meeting meeting_with with_a a_counselor counselor_to to_sort sort_of of_come come_up up_with with_a a_plan plan_that that_you you_and and_your your_kids kids_&apos; &apos;_dad dad_can can_kind kind_of of_put put_together together_. 
 so i guess given that you describe sort of when you smoke it really helps with your anxiety so_i i_guess guess_given given_that that_you you_describe describe_sort sort_of of_when when_you you_smoke smoke_it it_really really_helps helps_with with_your your_anxiety anxiety_. 
 but for you it &apos;s almost like it &apos;s medicating anxiety but if you saw yourself with less anxiety then marijuana wouldn &apos;t really be as necessary but_for for_you you_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_almost almost_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_medicating medicating_anxiety anxiety_but but_if if_you you_saw saw_yourself yourself_with with_less less_anxiety anxiety_then then_marijuana marijuana_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_really really_be be_as as_necessary necessary_. 
 mm-hmm well yeah it &apos;s very clear how much love and attention that you &apos;ve given to your family and how important they are good for you mm-hmm_well well_yeah yeah_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_very very_clear clear_how how_much much_love love_and and_attention attention_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_given given_to to_your your_family family_and and_how how_important important_they they_are are_good good_for for_you you_. 
 so the antidepressant right now is actually making it &apos;s not worth it so_the the_antidepressant antidepressant_right right_now now_is is_actually actually_making making_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_worth worth_it it_. 
 and it feels like you and_it it_feels feels_like like_you you_. 
 and i think you had said too that in addition to the counseling you would also potentially consider talking to someone about anxiety as well and_i i_think think_you you_had had_said said_too too_that that_in in_addition addition_to to_the the_counseling counseling_you you_would would_also also_potentially potentially_consider consider_talking talking_to to_someone someone_about about_anxiety anxiety_as as_well well_. 
 but that isn &apos;t something that you had had sort of but_that that_isn isn_&apos;t &apos;t_something something_that that_you you_had had_had had_sort sort_of of_. 
 okay so it was in relation to the overdose okay okay_so so_it it_was was_in in_relation relation_to to_the the_overdose overdose_okay okay_. 
 okay so by cutting down it sounds like you were thinking use occasionally but not use as much okay_so so_by by_cutting cutting_down down_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_were were_thinking thinking_use use_occasionally occasionally_but but_not not_use use_as as_much much_. 
 okay and it seems like what you had said too is maybe if there were other ways that you could help deal with your anxiety then smoking weed wouldn &apos;t necessarily be something that would be as necessary all the time okay_and and_it it_seems seems_like like_what what_you you_had had_said said_too too_is is_maybe maybe_if if_there there_were were_other other_ways ways_that that_you you_could could_help help_deal deal_with with_your your_anxiety anxiety_then then_smoking smoking_weed weed_wouldn wouldn_&apos;t &apos;t_necessarily necessarily_be be_something something_that that_would would_be be_as as_necessary necessary_all all_the the_time time_. 
 okay so higher than a two or three okay_so so_higher higher_than than_a a_two two_or or_three three_.

 okay but once you made up your mind it sounds like you &apos;d be pretty confident that you &apos;d be able to see it through okay_but but_once once_you you_made made_up up_your your_mind mind_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_pretty pretty_confident confident_that that_you you_&apos;d &apos;d_be be_able able_to to_see see_it it_through through_.

 there &apos;s a part of you that wants the normal life and the other part of you is wanting to be able to be different and how you i &apos;m not quite sure what the different is that you &apos;re wanting but how you &apos;ve gotten that is through the cocaine there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_part part_of of_you you_that that_wants wants_the the_normal normal_life life_and and_the the_other other_part part_of of_you you_is is_wanting wanting_to to_be be_able able_to to_be be_different different_and and_how how_you you_i i_&apos;m &apos;m_not not_quite quite_sure sure_what what_the the_different different_is is_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_wanting wanting_but but_how how_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_gotten gotten_that that_is is_through through_the the_cocaine cocaine_.

 so you don &apos;t like that they so_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_that that_they they_. 
 tired of it mm-hmm tired_of of_it it_mm-hmm mm-hmm_. 
 everything everything_. 
 three eight seven three_eight eight_seven seven_. 
 ninety three ninety_three three_. 
 from what you said before i didn &apos;t think so from_what what_you you_said said_before before_i i_didn didn_&apos;t &apos;t_think think_so so_. 
 mm-hmm so you &apos;re kinda looking at yourself trying to get some help mm-hmm_so so_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_kinda kinda_looking looking_at at_yourself yourself_trying trying_to to_get get_some some_help help_. 
 you &apos;re trying to say you feel like maybe you &apos;re not addicted it &apos;s the circumstances and stuff like you_&apos;re &apos;re_trying trying_to to_say say_you you_feel feel_like like_maybe maybe_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_not not_addicted addicted_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_circumstances circumstances_and and_stuff stuff_like like_. 
 do the same things over and over do_the the_same same_things things_over over_and and_over over_. 
 if you could change those patterns something like that okay if_you you_could could_change change_those those_patterns patterns_something something_like like_that that_okay okay_. 
 because i know she &apos;s been asking a lot of questions like you said because_i i_know know_she she_&apos;s &apos;s_been been_asking asking_a a_lot lot_of of_questions questions_like like_you you_said said_. 
 and it sounds like you &apos;ve been thinking about change and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_been been_thinking thinking_about about_change change_. 
 so so_. 
 so it seems like now that you &apos;re getting older there &apos;s a connection between drug use and your health so_it it_seems seems_like like_now now_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_older older_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_connection connection_between between_drug drug_use use_and and_your your_health health_. 
 okay so you see a connection between the two okay_so so_you you_see see_a a_connection connection_between between_the the_two two_. 
 maybe the scene where you go maybe_the the_scene scene_where where_you you_go go_. 
 it sounds like there &apos;s something about what you &apos;re thinking about where it &apos;s definitely there &apos;s a better place than where you &apos;re yeah it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_about about_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_about about_where where_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_definitely definitely_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_better better_place place_than than_where where_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_yeah yeah_. 
 so based on some of your doing some of the old behaviors now you kinda see that maybe spiraling out of control so_based based_on on_some some_of of_your your_doing doing_some some_of of_the the_old old_behaviors behaviors_now now_you you_kinda kinda_see see_that that_maybe maybe_spiraling spiraling_out out_of of_control control_. 
 this ain &apos;t your first rodeo this_ain ain_&apos;t &apos;t_your your_first first_rodeo rodeo_. 
 so it sounds like there could be severe consequences based just on using cocaine okay so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_could could_be be_severe severe_consequences consequences_based based_just just_on on_using using_cocaine cocaine_okay okay_. 
 so you mentioned that there were patterns of behavior things that you do over and over again so_you you_mentioned mentioned_that that_there there_were were_patterns patterns_of of_behavior behavior_things things_that that_you you_do do_over over_and and_over over_again again_. 
 kind of caught yourself doing that it sounds like you said kinda like ahh yeah i could see myself doing that kind_of of_caught caught_yourself yourself_doing doing_that that_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_said said_kinda kinda_like like_ahh ahh_yeah yeah_i i_could could_see see_myself myself_doing doing_that that_. 
 i see so you find yourself throughout the day i_see see_so so_you you_find find_yourself yourself_throughout throughout_the the_day day_. 
 not every day not_every every_day day_. 
 definitely yeah and it sounds like there &apos;s maybe a sense of pride about getting this stuff together and trying to seek help for you definitely_yeah yeah_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_maybe maybe_a a_sense sense_of of_pride pride_about about_getting getting_this this_stuff stuff_together together_and and_trying trying_to to_seek seek_help help_for for_you you_. 
 so it sounds like you have a strong awareness of what you &apos;re doing where you need to be and what you need to do to do that and you &apos;re already getting some of that in place but you &apos;re still finding yourself doing some of these behaviors so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_have have_a a_strong strong_awareness awareness_of of_what what_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_where where_you you_need need_to to_be be_and and_what what_you you_need need_to to_do do_to to_do do_that that_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_already already_getting getting_some some_of of_that that_in in_place place_but but_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_still still_finding finding_yourself yourself_doing doing_some some_of of_these these_behaviors behaviors_. 
 some old thoughts even some_old old_thoughts thoughts_even even_. 
 okay so some of it &apos;s the old behaviors like hanging around people who are using when you know that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing but then there &apos;s also some thoughts that keep this going as well okay_so so_some some_of of_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_the the_old old_behaviors behaviors_like like_hanging hanging_around around_people people_who who_are are_using using_when when_you you_know know_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_what what_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_doing doing_but but_then then_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_also also_some some_thoughts thoughts_that that_keep keep_this this_going going_as as_well well_. 
 sound like you said some of those old thoughts keep you sound_like like_you you_said said_some some_of of_those those_old old_thoughts thoughts_keep keep_you you_. 
 going going_. 
 so it &apos;s not working for you so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_not not_working working_for for_you you_. 
 no no_. 
 so it &apos;s costing you more money than you so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_costing costing_you you_more more_money money_than than_you you_. 
 should be should_be be_. 
 right it sounds like it &apos;s hard to get by right_it it_sounds sounds_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_hard hard_to to_get get_by by_. 
   
 yeah it &apos;s almost like you notice that you &apos;re coming up short and you &apos;re thinking there &apos;s a red flag there yeah_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_almost almost_like like_you you_notice notice_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_coming coming_up up_short short_and and_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_thinking thinking_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_red red_flag flag_there there_. 
 they &apos;re popping up they_&apos;re &apos;re_popping popping_up up_. 
 yeah and you also said that it seemed like there was some relationship between using and your health yeah_and and_you you_also also_said said_that that_it it_seemed seemed_like like_there there_was was_some some_relationship relationship_between between_using using_and and_your your_health health_. 
 and there &apos;s something about if cocaine was out of the picture or scaled back that this would be a little bit and_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_about about_if if_cocaine cocaine_was was_out out_of of_the the_picture picture_or or_scaled scaled_back back_that that_this this_would would_be be_a a_little little_bit bit_. 
 mm-hmm so some of that might be just making a connection with all those people also who use drugs that &apos;s kind of become a strong association between seeking out people but people who use drugs yeah mm-hmm_so so_some some_of of_that that_might might_be be_just just_making making_a a_connection connection_with with_all all_those those_people people_also also_who who_use use_drugs drugs_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_kind kind_of of_become become_a a_strong strong_association association_between between_seeking seeking_out out_people people_but but_people people_who who_use use_drugs drugs_yeah yeah_. 
 mm-hmm sure well it sounds like you could use the comfort i mean it sounds like you could use some comfort i don &apos;t say that comfort but some comfort mm-hmm_sure sure_well well_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_could could_use use_the the_comfort comfort_i i_mean mean_it it_sounds sounds_like like_you you_could could_use use_some some_comfort comfort_i i_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_say say_that that_comfort comfort_but but_some some_comfort comfort_. 
 so so there &apos;s some sort of sharing of experience with these people then so_so so_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_some some_sort sort_of of_sharing sharing_of of_experience experience_with with_these these_people people_then then_. 
 so even though it &apos;s a group that uses cocaine and stuff like that there &apos;s something that &apos;s still so_even even_though though_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_a a_group group_that that_uses uses_cocaine cocaine_and and_stuff stuff_like like_that that_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_still still_. 
 it &apos;s like a understanding or you guys go through some of the same things or very it_&apos;s &apos;s_like like_a a_understanding understanding_or or_you you_guys guys_go go_through through_some some_of of_the the_same same_things things_or or_very very_. 
 you &apos;ve got some shared experiences and it sounds like they &apos;re pretty accepting of the things that you need to do you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_some some_shared shared_experiences experiences_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_they they_&apos;re &apos;re_pretty pretty_accepting accepting_of of_the the_things things_that that_you you_need need_to to_do do_. 
 yeah yeah so yeah there is something positive about this group of people that &apos;s there &apos;s something that you &apos;re getting out of hanging out with them but then you &apos;re also using drugs with them that sounds like yeah yeah_yeah yeah_so so_yeah yeah_there there_is is_something something_positive positive_about about_this this_group group_of of_people people_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_out out_of of_hanging hanging_out out_with with_them them_but but_then then_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_also also_using using_drugs drugs_with with_them them_that that_sounds sounds_like like_yeah yeah_. 
 mm-hmm so it sounds like i mean you told me there was a lot of kind of like negative things you &apos;re seeing connection between your use and your health the money and it was almost just like there &apos;s something about using that &apos;s just not where you wanna be at mm-hmm_so so_it it_sounds sounds_like like_i i_mean mean_you you_told told_me me_there there_was was_a a_lot lot_of of_kind kind_of of_like like_negative negative_things things_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_seeing seeing_connection connection_between between_your your_use use_and and_your your_health health_the the_money money_and and_it it_was was_almost almost_just just_like like_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_something something_about about_using using_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_not not_where where_you you_wanna wanna_be be_at at_. 
 tasteless tasteless_.

 and so even though i mean you had said that you weren &apos;t using heroine for too long and_so so_even even_though though_i i_mean mean_you you_had had_said said_that that_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_using using_heroine heroine_for for_too too_long long_.

 when you can afford it you use meth when_you you_can can_afford afford_it it_you you_use use_meth meth_. 
 okay okay_. 
 and it really you find it that it increases the pleasure and_it it_really really_you you_find find_it it_that that_it it_increases increases_the the_pleasure pleasure_. 
 so you &apos;ve known people who you feel like have used methamphetamines used meth and have gotten in trouble with it so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_known known_people people_who who_you you_feel feel_like like_have have_used used_methamphetamines methamphetamines_used used_meth meth_and and_have have_gotten gotten_in in_trouble trouble_with with_it it_. 
 yeah you really enjoy the sexual pleasure that you get when using meth yeah_you you_really really_enjoy enjoy_the the_sexual sexual_pleasure pleasure_that that_you you_get get_when when_using using_meth meth_.

 had some teeth that have decayed had_some some_teeth teeth_that that_have have_decayed decayed_. 
 so even without so_even even_without without_. 
 use you feel like you &apos;re getting some of the effects that you had before use_you you_feel feel_like like_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_getting getting_some some_of of_the the_effects effects_that that_you you_had had_before before_. 
 well there are some pretty serious pleasurable side effects on the other hand it &apos;s rotting your teeth away and it sounds like because of that you &apos;ve decreased your use well_there there_are are_some some_pretty pretty_serious serious_pleasurable pleasurable_side side_effects effects_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_rotting rotting_your your_teeth teeth_away away_and and_it it_sounds sounds_like like_because because_of of_that that_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_decreased decreased_your your_use use_. 
 so you &apos;ve got these sort of two things here where you like the effects on the other hand you don &apos;t like some of the effects that &apos;s oral so_you you_&apos;ve &apos;ve_got got_these these_sort sort_of of_two two_things things_here here_where where_you you_like like_the the_effects effects_on on_the the_other other_hand hand_you you_don don_&apos;t &apos;t_like like_some some_of of_the the_effects effects_that that_&apos;s &apos;s_oral oral_.

 you you know that you_you you_know know_that that_. 
 you &apos;re you_&apos;re &apos;re_. 
 so in some respects it doesn &apos;t sound like it &apos;s worth the tradeoff the pleasure you get versus the consequences so_in in_some some_respects respects_it it_doesn doesn_&apos;t &apos;t_sound sound_like like_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_worth worth_the the_tradeoff tradeoff_the the_pleasure pleasure_you you_get get_versus versus_the the_consequences consequences_. 
 you have higher ambitions than that you_have have_higher higher_ambitions ambitions_than than_that that_. 
 knowing the tradeoff between the increase in pleasure and then the health consequences knowing_the the_tradeoff tradeoff_between between_the the_increase increase_in in_pleasure pleasure_and and_then then_the the_health health_consequences consequences_. 
 so if you &apos;re yeah so_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_yeah yeah_.

 so it kinda triggers drinking so_it it_kinda kinda_triggers triggers_drinking drinking_. 
 so sort of like the flood gates open a little bit so_sort sort_of of_like like_the the_flood flood_gates gates_open open_a a_little little_bit bit_. 
 okay and sounds like the increase has mainly been because you &apos;re in an environment where people are asking a little bit more mm-hmm okay_and and_sounds sounds_like like_the the_increase increase_has has_mainly mainly_been been_because because_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_an an_environment environment_where where_people people_are are_asking asking_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_mm-hmm mm-hmm_.

 okay so she wasn &apos;t sure if there was gonna be any kind of effect okay_so so_she she_wasn wasn_&apos;t &apos;t_sure sure_if if_there there_was was_gonna gonna_be be_any any_kind kind_of of_effect effect_. 
 so you had mentioned going to treatment recently so_you you_had had_mentioned mentioned_going going_to to_treatment treatment_recently recently_. 
 you were saying that you can &apos;t necessarily pinpoint what you enjoy about it but that one of the main things is that when you do it you want more and then you &apos;re also in this place where there &apos;s just constantly people that make it really available you_were were_saying saying_that that_you you_can can_&apos;t &apos;t_necessarily necessarily_pinpoint pinpoint_what what_you you_enjoy enjoy_about about_it it_but but_that that_one one_of of_the the_main main_things things_is is_that that_when when_you you_do do_it it_you you_want want_more more_and and_then then_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_also also_in in_this this_place place_where where_there there_&apos;s &apos;s_just just_constantly constantly_people people_that that_make make_it it_really really_available available_. 
 so again it just sort of almost has the flood gates and things kind of start doing other things a little bit more so_again again_it it_just just_sort sort_of of_almost almost_has has_the the_flood flood_gates gates_and and_things things_kind kind_of of_start start_doing doing_other other_things things_a a_little little_bit bit_more more_. 
 mm-hmm so it &apos;s got you to kind of lose interest in certain things that you were once interested in and also causes some financial issues as well mm-hmm_so so_it it_&apos;s &apos;s_got got_you you_to to_kind kind_of of_lose lose_interest interest_in in_certain certain_things things_that that_you you_were were_once once_interested interested_in in_and and_also also_causes causes_some some_financial financial_issues issues_as as_well well_. 
 but it sounds like also what you were saying was when you have appointments that sort of helps you a little bit in terms of maybe not using right before the appointment or but_it it_sounds sounds_like like_also also_what what_you you_were were_saying saying_was was_when when_you you_have have_appointments appointments_that that_sort sort_of of_helps helps_you you_a a_little little_bit bit_in in_terms terms_of of_maybe maybe_not not_using using_right right_before before_the the_appointment appointment_or or_. 
 things like that things_like like_that that_. 
 it &apos;s different it_&apos;s &apos;s_different different_. 
 so seems like treatment you felt like was pretty effective and then before you were living in an area where the temptation may just not have been as present but a lot of it just seems centered around the fact that you &apos;re in the neighborhood that you &apos;re in right now so_seems seems_like like_treatment treatment_you you_felt felt_like like_was was_pretty pretty_effective effective_and and_then then_before before_you you_were were_living living_in in_an an_area area_where where_the the_temptation temptation_may may_just just_not not_have have_been been_as as_present present_but but_a a_lot lot_of of_it it_just just_seems seems_centered centered_around around_the the_fact fact_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_the the_neighborhood neighborhood_that that_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_in in_right right_now now_. 
 so having that community having other people that have kind of shared similar experiences was helpful in feeling like maybe you weren &apos;t as alone in what you had gone through as well and the chance to do cool things like make dream catchers too so_having having_that that_community community_having having_other other_people people_that that_have have_kind kind_of of_shared shared_similar similar_experiences experiences_was was_helpful helpful_in in_feeling feeling_like like_maybe maybe_you you_weren weren_&apos;t &apos;t_as as_alone alone_in in_what what_you you_had had_gone gone_through through_as as_well well_and and_the the_chance chance_to to_do do_cool cool_things things_like like_make make_dream dream_catchers catchers_too too_. 
 so keeping yourself busy kinda out of the building maybe sort of connecting with other people who may not be using as much you think would make more of a difference so_keeping keeping_yourself yourself_busy busy_kinda kinda_out out_of of_the the_building building_maybe maybe_sort sort_of of_connecting connecting_with with_other other_people people_who who_may may_not not_be be_using using_as as_much much_you you_think think_would would_make make_more more_of of_a a_difference difference_. 
 mm-hmm and so one of your primary concerns also is what does it mean in terms of if you &apos;re starting to take your h i v meds and then also using as well mm-hmm_and and_so so_one one_of of_your your_primary primary_concerns concerns_also also_is is_what what_does does_it it_mean mean_in in_terms terms_of of_if if_you you_&apos;re &apos;re_starting starting_to to_take take_your your_h h_i i_v v_meds meds_and and_then then_also also_using using_as as_well well_.
